## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Block any plan from reaching implementation unless it is hallucination-free (every existing-code claim proven at `file:line`) and implementation-ready (every step concrete, small enough to code from immediately) — by auto-reviewing implementation plans for validity, correctness, and best practices. **Recursive:** when any findings exist, validate findings with `/why-review --validate-findings`, fix only validated findings in plan files, and rerun the full plan review until the round's exit bar is clear — **zero findings in rounds 1-2, zero CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM from round 3 (a LOW-only round ENDS the loop, deferred not fixed)**.

Every phase review treats **Mode, Wave, write set, and SEQ dependency** as one indivisible metadata contract; a mismatch in any field blocks approval.

**Summary:** AI self-review (automatic, NOT a user interview like `/plan-validate`) that gates a plan before implementation.

- **Purpose:** review as a SKEPTIC, not validator — every existing-code claim needs `file:line` proof (Anti-Hallucination Gate); every phase must clear the "Detailed & Small Enough" granularity gate (≤5 files, ≤3h, no planning verbs) — too vague → detail it, too big → break it.
- **Main steps (run in order):** Phase 0 detect plan type → Step 1 read `plan.md` + `goal.md` + all `phase-*.md`, extract requirements/steps/files/risks → Step 2 evaluate the 4 checklist groups: **Validity** (summary, requirements, steps, files) · **Correctness** (Granularity Gate + Anti-Hallucination/Code-Proof Gate + spec/TC coverage + Goal-Contract mapping) · **Best Practices** (YAGNI/KISS/DRY/architecture) · **Completeness** (risks, testing, success criteria, security, graph-dependency) → run the 11 Adversarial techniques + Anti-Bias Gate + 8 Plan Dimensions → graph-trace each modified file (when graph.db exists) → Step 3 score PASS/WARN/FAIL → Step 4 output result → Step 5 recursive validate-fix-re-review loop.
- **Detect plan type FIRST (Phase 0)** so the right focus applies — bugfix MANDATES the Behavioral Delta Matrix; security/performance/refactor/contract/infra/data-schema each add targeted checks.
- **Findings are never fixed blindly:** run the `/why-review --validate-findings` gate BEFORE editing any `plan.md`/`phase-*.md`, fix only validated findings at the smallest responsible location, then restart the FULL review with a fresh, zero-memory sub-agent — loop until a clean pass at the round's bar.
- **Severity floor — from round 3, LOW stops blocking.** Rounds 1-2 require zero findings at any severity. **From round 3 the bar is zero validated CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM — a review round whose validated findings are ALL LOW ENDS the loop.** Do NOT restart the full review for LOW findings alone: record them under `## Deferred LOW Findings (severity floor, round ≥3)` in the report and PASS. NEVER re-tier a real CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM down to LOW to reach the exit, and NEVER apply the floor to a hallucinated-code claim or a missing-evidence finding — those are HIGH by definition, not deferrable LOW. Severity tiers per `SYNC:severity-rubric`.
- **Round cap 3 — a ceiling, NEVER a target;** a clean pass ends the loop immediately at ANY round (round 1 included). Escalate via `AskUserQuestion` when the same blocker survives 2 consecutive full re-reviews with no progress, when round 3 completes with findings still open, or when a finding needs product/owner judgment — cap exhaustion escalates, it NEVER becomes a PASS.

**Workflow:**

1. **Resolve Plan** — Use $ARGUMENTS path or active plan from `## Plan Context`
2. **Read Files** — plan.md + all phase-\*.md files, extract requirements/steps/files/risks
3. **Evaluate Checklist** — Validity (summary, requirements, steps, files), Correctness (specific, paths, no conflicts), Best Practices (YAGNI/KISS/DRY, architecture), Completeness (risks, testing, success, security)
4. **Score & Classify** — PASS (all Required + ≥50% Recommended), WARN (all Required + <50% Recommended), FAIL (any Required fails)
5. **Output Result** — Status, checks passed, issues, recommendations, verdict
6. **If any findings remain** — Run `/why-review --validate-findings` on the plan-review report first; fix only validated actionable issues in plan files, then re-review (loop back to step 2 until the round's bar is clear — zero findings in rounds 1-2, zero CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM from round 3 — unless the repeated-blocker rule or the 3-round cap applies)

**Core Principle — Detailed & Small Enough:**

- **Too vague?** → Detail it: add specific file paths, concrete actions, exact method names
- **Too big to detail?** → Break it: split into smaller phases/sub-plans until each is detailed
- A plan that can't be immediately coded from is NOT ready. Every step must be implementation-ready.

**Key Rules:**

- **No hallucination**: Every plan claim about existing source code must have `file:line` proof — unverified paths, class names, or behaviors = FAIL
- **PASS**: Proceed to implementation
- **WARN**: Proceed with caution, note gaps
- **FAIL (any findings)**: Validate findings with `/why-review --validate-findings`, fix only validated plan issues, then **re-run the FULL review from the start**. Repeat this self-loop — no forced minimum, capped at 3 rounds MAX — until a complete pass finds ZERO findings.
- **Bounded loop — two escalation triggers, neither a completion criterion**: (a) **no-progress safety** — the SAME blocker surviving 2 consecutive full re-reviews with no progress; (b) **round cap** — round 3 completing with findings still open. Whichever trips first → STOP and escalate to user via `AskUserQuestion`, never a silent "good enough" PASS. A clean pass ends the loop immediately, even on round 1 — the cap is a ceiling, not a quota.
- **Constructive**: Focus on implementation-blocking issues, not pedantic details

**Be skeptical. Apply critical thinking, sequential thinking. Every claim needs traced proof, confidence percentages (Idea should be more than 80%).**

## First Principle — Easy to Change

> **The success metric of every coding decision is _future change cost_.**
> DRY, SRP, abstraction, design patterns, naming, layering, tests — every
> technique exists to serve one goal: **making the next change cheaper**.

Evaluating code, refactor, test, abstraction, ask: **does this make the next change cheaper or more expensive?**

- Reject "best practices" raising change cost — premature abstraction, speculative generality, leaky indirection, ceremony without payoff.
- Name the real enemies in findings: **coupling, hidden state, duplicated knowledge, unclear intent, irreversible decisions exposed too early**.
- A simpler design that is easy to change beats a sophisticated one that is not.

Apply this lens **before** any rule, pattern, or checklist below — a downstream rule that raises change cost LOSES to this principle.

## Adversarial Review Mindset (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**Default stance: SKEPTIC, not validator. Your job is to find what cannot work, not confirm what looks right.**

> **Confirmation bias trap:** After reading a well-structured plan, AI naturally finds reasons to agree. This section exists to break that loop before it produces a rubber-stamp approval.

### Adversarial Techniques (apply ALL before concluding)

> Techniques 1-6 stress **whether the plan can be built** (reality, effort, scope, dependencies). Techniques 7-10 stress **whether the chosen design is the right one** — the decision-quality lens shared with `/why-review`'s rationale review. Apply both groups: a buildable plan built on the wrong decision is still a failed plan.

**1. Implementation Reality Check**
Per phase: _"a developer starts implementing this right now — what breaks FIRST?"_ Walk the critical path concretely. A vague phase ("implement the service layer") untraceable to specific files/classes FAILS.

**2. Assumption Stress Test**
List the top 3 implicit assumptions; per assumption: _"what if it is wrong?"_ A valid plan survives 2 of 3 being false. Usual hidden ones: existing code is in a known state · no external API changes · team already has this domain knowledge.

**3. Effort Reality Check**
Per estimated phase: _"has similar work in THIS codebase shipped in that timeframe, and what slowed it last time?"_ Underestimating by 2x or more makes it an optimistic guess, NOT a valid plan.

**4. Pre-Mortem**
Assume the plan shipped exactly as written and the feature has been in production a month. Write ONE concrete, plausible failure scenario. Finding none means you have not looked hard enough.

**5. Scope Creep Detector**
Flag any task NOT directly required to deliver the stated feature. "While we're here, let's also refactor X" is scope creep.

**6. Dependency Blindspot**
List 2-3 external dependencies (services, APIs, data sources) the plan assumes stable; per one: _"what breaks here if it changes or goes away?"_ A dependency failure addressed nowhere is a risk gap.

**7. Steel-Man the Rejected Alternative**
Per design decision choosing X over an alternative, argue FOR the rejected one as strongly as possible. Would a 10-year domain senior pick it? If yes, dismissal needs proof stronger than "we picked X" — why: a decision that never names what it rejected was assumed, not made.

**8. Why NOT?**
Per "chose X because Y", ask what X *sacrifices*. A plan listing only upsides is hiding the trade-off, not avoiding it. Demand the named downside.

**9. Unseen Alternatives**
Name 1-2 viable approaches the plan never mentions. An alternative absent without exclusion reasoning is weak coverage, NOT a settled decision.

**10. Pros/Cons Symmetry**
Count stated pros vs cons on the chosen approach. Pros outnumbering cons by more than 2:1 signals confirmation bias — demand the missing downsides before accepting.

**11. Contrarian Pass**
Before ANY verdict, write ≥2 sentences arguing the OPPOSITE. About to write PASS → argue NEEDS WORK, and vice versa. Then pick the stronger argument on evidence.

### Forbidden Patterns

- **"Structure looks good"** → Structure is NOT quality. Can it be implemented?
- **"Phases are well-defined"** → Presence of phases is NOT correctness. What's in them?
- **"Alternatives were considered"** → Were they real alternatives or strawmen set up to fail?
- **"Risk is managed"** → Mitigation of "monitor closely" is NOT a mitigation. What action, by whom, triggered by what?
- **"Looks achievable"** without tracing the critical path → Not a valid assessment.

### Anti-Bias Gate (MANDATORY before finalizing verdict)

Complete ALL checks before writing the final verdict (MUST ATTENTION):

- run Implementation Reality Check on the highest-risk phase
- identify 3 implicit assumptions and stress-test them
- check effort estimates against codebase complexity
- run pre-mortem (one concrete production failure scenario)
- scan for scope creep (tasks not required for stated feature)
- verify dependency blindspots are addressed
- steel-man at least one rejected design alternative (argue FOR it)
- name at least 1 viable alternative the plan does not mention
- check pros/cons symmetry on the plan's primary design decision

If any check is incomplete → you have NOT completed the adversarial review. Go back.

> **Why-review relationship:** Techniques 7-10 + these gate checks are the *rationale* lens applied DURING the review pass (does the plan's design hold up?). The separate `/why-review --validate-findings` gate runs AFTER findings exist (are the findings themselves correct before we fix them?). Both stay — they validate different things and must not be collapsed.

## Plan Dimension Thinking Framework

After plan-type detection (Phase 0), evaluate each dimension below using this reasoning pattern:

> **For each dimension:** (1) Understand its role in the plan's domain, (2) Read the plan's claims about it, (3) Derive the actual concerns from first principles — what could go wrong if this dimension is weak? (4) Apply your knowledge of the plan's tech stack to find stack-specific gaps.

### Dimension 1: Scope Integrity

**Think:** Does the plan's scope match the stated goal exactly — not broader, not narrower?

- What's the minimal set of changes needed to deliver the stated goal?
- What does the plan add that's NOT in the goal? → Scope creep.
- What's in the goal that the plan doesn't address? → Scope gap.
- Stress test: "If we skip phase X, does the feature still work?" → If yes, that phase is out of scope.

### Dimension 2: Data Flow Correctness

**Think:** Can I trace how data moves through every phase of this plan?

- Where does data originate? Where does it end up?
- What transforms it in between? Are those transforms described in the plan?
- What happens to data at system boundaries (API, message bus, storage, UI)? Does the plan address each boundary?
- What data states are invalid? Does the plan guard against them?

### Dimension 3: Dependency Chain Completeness

**Think:** Does the plan account for everything its changes affect?

- Every file/module the plan touches: what imports it? what calls it? what depends on its contract?
- If the plan changes an interface/contract, are ALL consumers listed?
- External dependencies (third-party services, shared infra): are they stable? If they break, what's the fallback?
- Run graph trace if graph.db exists — compare plan's file list against downstream impact.

### Dimension 4: Failure Mode Coverage

**Think:** What does the plan say about when things go wrong?

- For each external call, async operation, or state change: what's the error behavior?
- Does the plan include a rollback strategy for irreversible operations?
- What's the partial failure state? (half-migrated, half-deployed, race condition) Is it addressable?
- Is there a monitoring/alerting plan for the new code paths?

### Dimension 5: Test Observability

**Think:** How will a developer know if this plan's implementation is correct?

- Can the stated acceptance criteria be mechanically verified by a test?
- Are there behaviors that are only observable via logs/traces (not unit tests)?
- Which phase introduces the risk? Does a test exist in that phase?
- "Tests pass" is NOT a success criterion — name the specific behaviors being tested.
- **Spec-Loop scheduling (test-quality gate).** The plan MUST schedule the spec-loop, not just "add tests": (1) every `[HARD]` §4 rule / §5 invariant gets a universally-quantified **property test spec** plus a boundary counter-case — not example tests only; (2) changed core logic is gated by a **MUTATION-SCORE** quality bar (a surviving mutant = a missing invariant ⇒ a killing test owed), NOT a line-coverage % target; (3) a **dual-feedback + re-review step** exists so each behavior-changing finding enriches BOTH the spec AND the tests and the package is re-reviewed to zero new gaps. **FAIL** a plan that targets a line-coverage % instead of a mutation-score bar, or that omits property/invariant test specs for its `[HARD]`/§5 rules.

### Dimension 6: Knowledge Prerequisites

**Think:** Does implementing this plan require knowledge the plan doesn't surface?

- Domain knowledge: Are business rules spelled out, or does the implementer need to already know them?
- System knowledge: Are integration points documented, or does the implementer need tribal knowledge?
- Tooling knowledge: Does the plan assume setup steps that aren't listed?
- If any prerequisite is unstated → the plan is not implementation-ready.

### Dimension 7: Estimation Drift

**Think:** Does the frontmatter estimation still match the finalized plan, or did scope-locking change the cost?

- Pre-completion estimates anchor on rough scope guesses; finalized phases reveal true cost. Re-derive `bottom_up_hours = Σ phase_hours` from each phase file's locked tasks/TCs and compare to current frontmatter `man_days_traditional` / `story_points`.
- Recompute `likely_days`, `risk_margin_pct`, `min-max range` per `SYNC:estimation-framework`. Did unknowns resolve (margin should drop) or new risks surface (margin should rise)?
- If `|delta| > 20%` → frontmatter MUST be updated with `reestimate_delta_pct: <signed>` + 1-line `reestimate_reason`. Missing update = FAIL.
- If `|delta| > 50%` → flag `SHOULD-RESCOPE` in review verdict; the plan must surface the rescope decision to the user before implementation begins.
- Watch for hidden inflation: phases added during planning, TCs not counted in original estimate, integration work discovered late.

### Dimension 8: Domain Entity Design (CONDITIONAL — fires when the plan touches an entity, VO, or aggregate)

**Think:** Does the plan actually decide the domain model, or does it defer the hard parts to implementation?

Apply `SYNC:domain-entity-change-gate` (inlined below) — the SAME protocol `/plan` authored under and `/changes-review` will review under, whose A–P checklist `/domain-entities-review` owns. State `No domain-entity surface — Dimension 8 N/A` when it does not fire.

- An **unanswered, hand-waved, or deferred-to-implementation** decision point is a FINDING with `file:line` into the plan. The word "entity" appearing in a task is NEVER an answer.
- MUST ATTENTION verify the plan states **paradigm** and **subdomain fit** before any entity task — a plan proposing a rich domain model for a CRUD subdomain is a FINDING (ceremony with no invariant to protect), and so is a plan proposing setter/encapsulation tasks against an immutable or event-sourced model.
- Check each triggered row names its **owning file**, not just an intent: classification · invariant ownership + failure signalling · aggregate boundary + concurrency · construction vs reconstitution · events · property-TC test obligation.
- Highest-yield misses: an aggregate boundary chosen by UI screen or DB table rather than by true invariant · cross-aggregate references planned as object navigation · no concurrency token on a contended root · a set-based invariant ("unique email") with no enforcing mechanism · invariants planned into a validator/handler instead of the entity · events planned with no dispatch timing.
- Steel-man the plan's boundary choice before flagging it — a deliberately larger aggregate protecting a real always-consistent invariant is CORRECT; demand the invariant, not a smaller boundary.

**Use these dimensions to generate targeted, evidence-backed questions — not generic "add more detail" suggestions.**

## Your mission

Self-review the implementation plan — valid, correct, best-practice — and surface everything needing a fix BEFORE implementation proceeds.

**Key distinction:** AI self-review (automatic), NOT a user interview like `/plan-validate`.

## Plan Resolution

1. `$ARGUMENTS` provided → use that path
2. Else `## Plan Context` section → use the active plan path
3. No plan found → error: "No plan to review. Run /plan first."

## Workflow

### Phase 0: Detect Plan Type

Before ANY checklist, read `plan.md` and classify the plan — why: the type decides the sub-agent, the emphasis, and whether the Behavioral Delta Matrix is mandatory:

| Signal in plan                                               | Type                      | Additional review focus                                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "fix", "bug", "regression", "defect" in title/description    | **Bugfix**                | Behavioral Delta Matrix (MANDATORY), preservation inventory, regression tests               |
| "migrate", "schema", "database", "index"                     | **Data/Schema**           | Rollback path, zero-downtime strategy, data preservation, migration idempotency             |
| "auth", "permission", "security", "encrypt", "token", "RBAC" | **Security**              | Threat modeling, attack surface, trust boundary changes, sub-agent: `security-auditor`      |
| "performance", "latency", "cache", "N+1", "throughput"       | **Performance**           | Baseline metrics, regression risk, measurement strategy, sub-agent: `performance-optimizer` |
| "refactor", "extract", "rename", "restructure"               | **Refactor**              | Behavior preservation, blast radius, dangling references                                    |
| "API", "contract", "endpoint", "consumer", "event"           | **Contract/Integration**  | Backward compatibility, consumer impact, versioning strategy                                |
| "infra", "CI", "pipeline", "deploy"                          | **Infrastructure/DevOps** | Rollback plan, environment parity, secrets handling                                         |
| None of the above                                            | **Feature**               | Standard checklist, acceptance criteria mapping, YAGNI                                      |

**If multiple signals match**, list all types and apply ALL their focus areas.

**Plan type drives:**

- Which sub-agent type to use (see "Subagent Type Selection" above)
- Which sections of the Adversarial Review Mindset to emphasize
- Whether Behavioral Delta Matrix is mandatory (bugfix only)

---

### Step 1: Read Plan Files

Read the plan directory:

- `plan.md` - Overview, phases list, frontmatter
- `goal.md` - Goal Contract (when present): Original Request, Purpose, Success Criteria (required vs optional), Constraints
- `phase-*.md` - All phase files
- Extract: requirements, implementation steps, file listings, risks

If `{plan-dir}/goal.md` is missing, resolve `plans/goals/{YYMMDD-HHmm}-{slug}/goal.md`; if no Goal Contract exists at all, record `No active goal — plan reviewed against plan.md requirements only.`

### Step 2: Evaluate Against Checklist

#### Validity (Required - all must pass)

| #   | Check                                                               | Presence                           | Quality Depth                                                                     |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | **Has executive summary** — clear 1-2 sentence description          | Does a summary section exist?      | Is it accurate? Does it scope the work or conceal complexity?                     |
| 2   | **Has defined requirements section** — explicit requirements listed | Does a requirements section exist? | Are requirements concrete user needs or vague technical goals?                    |
| 3   | **Has implementation steps** — actionable tasks                     | Are implementation steps present?  | Are steps specific (file names, method names) or vague actions?                   |
| 4   | **Has files to create/modify listing** — file inventory present     | Is a file listing present?         | Are file paths real (verified via glob/grep)? Do they follow project conventions? |

#### Correctness (Required - all must pass)

- [ ] **Granularity Gate — "Detailed & Small Enough"** — FAIL if ANY phase fails ANY criterion below. A plan you can't immediately code from is NOT ready.

**Decision tree — apply to EACH phase:**

```
Phase too vague? (no file paths, planning verbs, unclear actions)
  → YES → DETAIL IT: add specific file paths, exact method names, concrete actions
  → NO ↓
Phase too big? (>5 files OR >3h effort OR single step is a mini-project)
  → YES → BREAK IT: split into smaller sibling phases until each meets limits
  → NO → PASS this phase
```

**5-Point Criteria (all must pass per phase):**

| #   | Criterion                 | PASS example                    | FAIL example                       |
| --- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| 1   | Steps name specific files | "Modify `{source-root}/auth/login`" | "Implement authentication"         |
| 2   | No planning verbs         | "Add `validateToken()` method"  | "Determine the best auth approach" |
| 3   | Each step ≤30 min effort  | "Add error handler to endpoint" | "Build the entire auth module"     |
| 4   | Phase ≤5 files AND ≤3h    | 3 files, 2h                     | 12 files, 8h                       |
| 5   | No unresolved decisions   | All approaches decided          | "TBD: which library to use"        |

**Planning verbs that trigger FAIL:** "research", "determine", "figure out", "decide", "evaluate", "explore", "investigate" — these belong in investigation, not implementation plans.

**Action on failure (after Findings Validation Gate passes):**

Do not apply these refinements until `/why-review --validate-findings` returns CLEAN for the current plan-review report.

- **Too vague** → Refine in-place: expand steps with file paths, method names, concrete actions
- **Too big (≤9 files)** → Split phase into sibling phases (Phase 2A, 2B, 2C)
- **Too big (10+ files)** → Create sub-plan: `{plan-dir}/sub-plans/phase-{XX}-{name}/plan.md`

**Worked example:**
FAILS: `"Phase 2: Data Layer — Set up database models, Create repositories, Implement data access patterns. Effort: 4h, Files: ~8"`
PASSES after split: `"Phase 2A: Data Schema (1h, 3 files) — Create {source-root}/models/user-entity, Create {source-root}/models/session-entity, Create {migration-root}/create-users-sessions"` + `"Phase 2B: Repository Layer (1.5h, 3 files) — Create {source-root}/repositories/user-repository, Create {source-root}/repositories/session-repository, Register in {composition-root}"`

- [ ] File paths follow project patterns
- [ ] No conflicting or duplicate steps
- [ ] Dependencies between steps are clear
- [ ] **Anti-Hallucination & Code-Proof Gate** — FAIL if ANY plan claim about existing source code lacks `file:line` proof.

| Claim type             | Required proof                    |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| File path              | File exists (glob/read)           |
| Class/method name      | Symbol grep → `file:line`         |
| Behavior ("X calls Y") | Code evidence `file:line`         |
| Base class / interface | Inheritance verified (grep/graph) |

**FAIL triggers:** unread file paths, ungrepped method names, "should be"/"probably"/"typically" language about existing code, behaviors assumed from similar projects instead of THIS codebase. Greenfield-only plans (no existing code refs) → PASS.

- [ ] **New Tech/Lib Gate:** If plan introduces new packages/libraries/frameworks not in the project, verify alternatives were evaluated (top 3 compared) and user confirmed the choice. FAIL if new tech is added without evaluation.
- [ ] **Test spec coverage** — Every phase has `## Test Specifications` section with TC mappings. "TBD" is valid for TDD-first mode.
- [ ] **TC-requirement mapping** — Every functional requirement maps to ≥1 TC (or explicit "TBD" with rationale)
- [ ] **Behavior preservation** — Behavior-changing phases name expected behavior, unchanged behavior to preserve, and TC/test proof.
- [ ] **Docs/spec/test sync** — Relevant phases include canonical spec/doc/test updates or explicit N/A evidence.
- [ ] **Artifact freshness** — AI-extracted specs/TCs are marked reference-only until accepted; generated mirror sync is included for shared workflow/skill/tooling changes.
- [ ] **Goal Contract mapping** — When an active `goal.md` exists: every saved required success criterion is covered by ≥1 phase, and each phase's success criteria trace to saved criteria (or are marked supporting work with reason). FAIL if a saved required criterion has no covering phase, or the plan delivers work the Goal Contract never asked for without recorded justification. Skip with `No active goal` evidence when no Goal Contract exists.

#### Best Practices (Required - all must pass)

| 1   | **YAGNI** — No unnecessary features or over-engineering          | Is every planned component traceable to a stated requirement?   | Flag anything described as "might be useful" or added for future flexibility without a current requirement.                             |
| 2   | **KISS** — Simplest viable solution chosen                       | Is there a stated approach for each major step?                 | Could any planned abstraction be simpler with the same effect? Are there unnecessary layers, indirections, or framework choices?        |
| 3   | **DRY** — No planned duplication of logic                        | Are there similar patterns described more than once?            | Does the plan introduce new patterns when existing ones work? Are there repeated steps that suggest duplication at implementation time? |
| 4   | **Architecture** — Follows project patterns from `.claude/docs/` | Does the plan reference or align with `.claude/docs/` patterns? | Does it follow established patterns or deviate? Any deviations need explicit justification with rationale.                              |
| 5   | **Purpose-oriented contracts** — Names describe capability/domain purpose | Does every planned public or cross-layer abstraction have a semantic name? | Does the plan leak a provider/framework/transport into a caller-facing contract, use a misleadingly broad name, or add an interface without boundary/substitution rationale? |

#### Completeness (Recommended - ≥50% should pass)

| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | **Risk assessment present with mitigations** — risks identified with responses | Is there a risk section with at least one item?                                          | Are mitigations specific actions (who, when, triggered by what) or vague intentions ("monitor closely")?                           |
| 2   | **Testing strategy defined** — test approach outlined                          | Is there a testing section or test references per phase?                                 | Does it cover unit, integration, and edge case paths, or just "write tests"? Is the approach traceable to acceptance criteria?     |
| 3   | **Success criteria per phase** — measurable outcomes defined                   | Does each phase have stated success criteria?                                            | Are criteria measurable? Would failing them trigger a rollback, or are they aspirational targets?                                  |
| 4   | **Security considerations addressed** — security concerns noted                | Is there a security section or inline security notes?                                    | Are security concerns specific to this feature's attack surface, or generic boilerplate (e.g., "use HTTPS", "validate inputs")?    |
| 5   | **Graph dependency check** — importers of modified files are checked           | If `.code-graph/graph.db` exists: are `importers_of` queries run for each modified file? | Are ALL importers checked, not just direct callers? Is the graph.db prerequisite explicitly stated? Are missed dependents flagged? |

### Step 3: Score and Classify

| Status   | Criteria                            | Action                            |
| -------- | ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **PASS** | All Required pass, ≥50% Recommended | Proceed to implementation         |
| **WARN** | All Required pass, <50% Recommended | Proceed with caution, note gaps   |
| **FAIL** | Any Required check fails            | STOP - must fix before proceeding |

### Graph-Trace for Plan Coverage

When graph DB is available, verify the plan covers all affected files:

- For each file in the plan's "files to modify" list, run `python .claude/scripts/code_graph trace <file> --direction downstream --json`
- Flag any downstream file NOT listed in the plan as "potentially missed"
- This catches cross-service impact (MESSAGE_BUS consumers, event handlers) that the plan author may have overlooked

## Recursive Fix-and-Review Protocol (CRITICAL)

> **Protocol:** `SYNC:double-round-trip-review` + `SYNC:fresh-context-review` + `SYNC:review-protocol-injection` (all inlined above in this file).

When the review results in **FAIL, WARN, or any non-zero findings**, plan-review MUST run the Findings Validation Gate before editing any plan file. Only findings validated by `/why-review --validate-findings` may be fixed. After fixing validated actionable findings, rerun the full plan-review protocol from the first review step over the current plan. Do not spawn a fresh sub-agent just to re-review known findings before fixing them. If the restarted full review uses a sub-agent, it uses the canonical Agent template from `SYNC:review-protocol-injection` below and re-reads ALL plan files from scratch with ZERO memory of prior fixes.

## Findings Validation Gate (MANDATORY before fixing plan findings)

Trigger this gate whenever the plan-review output contains **any finding**: FAIL, WARN, recommendation requiring a plan edit, missing evidence, unresolved risk, or implementation-blocking ambiguity. Skip this gate only when the completed review pass has zero findings — or, from round 3, when its only validated findings are LOW (record them as deferred and PASS).

1. Finalize the plan-review report with every finding and enough evidence for another reviewer to validate it.
2. Call `/why-review --validate-findings` against that report in the main review flow before editing plan files.
3. If why-review returns CLEAN, fix only the validated actionable findings at the smallest responsible plan location.
4. If why-review challenges, rejects, or narrows findings, reconcile the plan-review report first, then rerun `/why-review --validate-findings` before any fix.
5. If a finding is valid but needs product/owner judgment, stop and ask the user instead of editing around the uncertainty.

**NEVER edit `plan.md` or `phase-*.md` to fix review findings before this gate passes.** This gate validates findings; the fresh full plan-review happens only after the validated fix cycle.

**When constructing the Agent call prompt for Round N (N≥2):**

1. Copy the Agent call shape from the `SYNC:review-protocol-injection` template verbatim
2. Use `subagent_type: "general-purpose"` (this is a plan review, not a code review)
3. Embed the full verbatim body of these SYNC blocks (inlined above in this skill file): `SYNC:evidence-based-reasoning`, `SYNC:rationalization-prevention`, `SYNC:graph-assisted-investigation`, `SYNC:understand-code-first` (omit code-specific protocols like `SYNC:bug-detection`, `SYNC:test-spec-verification` which are not applicable to plan files)
4. Set the Task as `"Review plan files under {plan-dir}. Validate structural completeness, code-proof anti-hallucination (every file:line claim about existing source code must exist), and adversarial simulation (imagine implementing each phase right now — what fails first?)."`
5. Set Target Files as `"read plan.md and all phase-*.md files under {plan-dir}"`
6. Set report path as `plans/reports/plan-review-round{N}-{date}.md`

After the sub-agent returns:

1. **Read** the sub-agent's report
2. **Integrate** findings as `## Re-Review {N} Findings` in the main report — DO NOT filter or override
3. **If FAIL, WARN, or any findings remain:** run the Findings Validation Gate, fix only validated actionable findings in plan files, then restart the full plan-review protocol from the first review step
4. **Repeated blocker cap:** if the same blocker repeats across 2 full invocations with no progress, escalate via `AskUserQuestion`
5. **Final verdict** must incorporate findings from ALL review passes that actually ran

```

### Iteration Rules

1. **Repeated blocker cap** — continue until a complete full review pass clears the round's bar (zero findings in rounds 1-2; zero CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM from round 3, LOW-only ends it); if the same blocker repeats across 2 full invocations with no progress, STOP and escalate to user via `AskUserQuestion`
2. **Track round count** — log "Plan review Round N (full re-review)" at the start of each cycle
3. **Zero findings = exit** — proceed only when a complete plan-review pass has no findings. WARN remains a finding unless it is explicitly accepted as non-actionable by the user/owner.
4. **Diminishing scope** — each round should find FEWER issues. If Round N finds MORE than Round N-1, STOP and escalate
5. **Fix scope** — fix only why-review-validated actionable findings at the smallest responsible plan location. Do NOT rewrite the plan.
6. **Fix approach:**
    - Vague steps → expand with specific file paths, concrete actions
    - Missing sections → add them (risks, testing strategy, success criteria)
    - Conflicting steps → resolve conflicts, document rationale
    - Over-engineering → simplify, remove unnecessary complexity
    - Missing TC mappings → add TC references or "TBD" with rationale
7. **After each validated fix cycle** — rerun the full plan-review protocol from the first review step; when that restarted protocol uses agents, spawn NEW Agent calls and never reuse prior agents
8. **No silent fallback** — if the same blocker repeats across 2 full invocations with no progress, escalate via `AskUserQuestion`. NEVER fall back to any prior protocol.

## Next Steps

- **If PASS with zero findings** (or, from round 3, PASS with only deferred LOW findings listed): Announce "Plan review complete. Proceeding with next workflow step."
- **If WARN or other findings remain**: Run the Findings Validation Gate; fix only validated actionable findings in plan files, or ask the user to explicitly accept non-actionable risk before proceeding.
- **If FAIL**: Run the Findings Validation Gate, fix only validated actionable findings in plan files, then rerun the full plan-review protocol recursively.
- **If repeated blocker cap is reached**: List remaining issues. STOP. Ask user to fix or regenerate plan via `AskUserQuestion`.

## Important Notes

- Be constructive, not pedantic — focus on issues that would cause implementation problems
- WARN is not an automatic exit condition; fix it when actionable, or document explicit non-actionable acceptance before proceeding.
- FAIL remains for genuinely missing required content; lower-severity findings still remain tracked until resolved or explicitly accepted.
- **NEVER do a quick review** — even "simple" plans had 13 bugs in real testing. Always run the complete declared review protocol; do not stop because of an arbitrary round count.

## Skill Interconnection (Standalone: MUST ATTENTION ask user via `AskUserQuestion`. Skip if inside workflow.)

**MANDATORY — NO EXCEPTIONS** after completing this skill, you MUST use `AskUserQuestion` to present these options. Do NOT skip because the task seems "simple" or "obvious" — the user decides:

- **"Proceed with full workflow (Recommended)"** — I'll detect the best workflow to continue from here (plan reviewed). This ensures validation, implementation, testing, and docs steps aren't skipped.
- **"/plan-validate"** — Interview user to confirm plan assumptions
- **"/feature-implement" or "/plan-execute"** — If plan is approved and ready for implementation
- **"Skip, continue manually"** — user decides

> **[BLOCKING]** This is a validation gate. MUST ATTENTION use `AskUserQuestion` to present review findings and get user confirmation. Completing without asking at least one question is a violation.

> **[IMPORTANT]** Use `TaskCreate` to break ALL work into small tasks BEFORE starting — including tasks for each file read. This prevents context loss from long files. For simple tasks, AI must ask user whether to skip.

> **Critical Purpose:** Ensure quality — no flaws, no bugs, no missing updates, no stale content. Verify both code AND documentation.

> **External Memory:** For complex or lengthy work (research, analysis, scan, review), write intermediate findings and final results to a report file in `plans/reports/` — prevents context loss and serves as deliverable.

> **Evidence Gate:** MANDATORY — every claim, finding, and recommendation requires `file:line` proof or traced evidence with confidence percentage (>80% to act, <80% must verify first).

> **OOP & DRY Enforcement:** MANDATORY — flag duplicated patterns that should be extracted to a base class, generic, or helper. Classes in the same group (same suffix, same lifecycle, same purpose) must share a common base (even if empty now — enables future shared logic and child overrides). Verify project has code linting/analyzer configured for the stack.

<!-- SYNC:fresh-context-review -->

> **Fresh Context Re-Review** — Eliminate orchestrator confirmation bias after fixes by restarting the full review with isolated sub-agents where applicable.
>
> **Why:** The main agent knows what it (or `/feature-implement`) just fixed and rationalizes findings accordingly. A fresh sub-agent has ZERO memory, re-reads from scratch, and catches what the main agent dismissed. Sub-agent bias is mitigated by (1) fresh context, (2) verbatim protocol injection, (3) main agent not filtering the report.
>
> **When:** ONLY after a validated-finding fix cycle. A review round that finds zero issues ENDS the loop — do NOT spawn a confirmation sub-agent. A review round that finds issues triggers: validate findings → fix → full review restart from the first phase.
>
> **How:**
>
> 1. Start a NEW full review invocation/task breakdown; when that protocol calls for agents, spawn NEW `Agent` tool calls — use `code-reviewer` subagent_type for code reviews, `general-purpose` for plan/doc/artifact reviews
> 2. Inject ALL required review protocols VERBATIM into the prompt — see `SYNC:review-protocol-injection` for the full list and template. Never reference protocols by file path; AI compliance drops behind file-read indirection (see `SYNC:shared-protocol-duplication-policy`)
> 3. Sub-agent re-reads ALL target files from scratch via its own tool calls — never pass file contents inline in the prompt
> 4. Sub-agent writes structured report to `plans/reports/{review-type}-round{N}-{date}.md`
> 5. Main agent reads the report, integrates findings into its own report, DOES NOT override or filter
>
> **Rules:**
>
> - SKIP fresh sub-agent when the prior full review found zero issues (no fixes = nothing new to verify)
> - NEVER skip the full review restart after a fix cycle — every fix invalidates the prior verdict
> - NEVER reuse a sub-agent across rounds — every fresh round spawns a NEW `Agent` call
> - Continue until a complete full review pass clears that round's exit bar per `SYNC:double-round-trip-review`: **rounds 1-2** → zero findings at any severity; **round 3+** → zero CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM, so a round whose validated findings are ALL LOW ENDS the loop (list those LOWs as deferred instead of spawning another round). If the same blocker repeats 3 times with no progress, escalate via `AskUserQuestion`
> - Track iteration count and repeated blockers in conversation context (session-scoped, no persistent files)

<!-- SYNC:double-round-trip-review -->

> **Validated-Finding Fix + Full Re-Review Loop** — Re-review is triggered by a validated finding fix cycle, not by a round number. Review purpose: `review → validate findings → fix validated findings → full re-review` until a complete review pass clears the round's exit bar (see **Severity floor** below). **A clean review ENDS the loop — no further rounds required.**
>
> _aka **Self-Review Convergence Loop**._ The name is historical — there is **NO 2-round cap**; "double-round-trip" only means a validated-finding fix cycle forces at least one fresh re-review. It runs until a clean pass, bounded by the **3-round ceiling** below.
>
> **Round cap — 3 rounds MAX (a ceiling, NEVER a target).** A clean pass ENDS the loop immediately at ANY round — round 1 included; the cap never obliges you to keep spinning. Hitting round 3 with blocking findings still open (severity floor applied) → **STOP and escalate via `AskUserQuestion`** with the still-open findings listed; NEVER emit a silent "good enough" PASS on cap exhaustion, and NEVER let the cap substitute for the clean-review requirement. The 2-repeated-no-progress blocker rule stays an EARLIER exit — escalate at whichever trips first.
>
> **Severity floor — from round 3, LOW stops blocking.** The exit bar tightens by round, so the loop converges on consequence instead of spinning on polish:

> Define one predicate everywhere: `blocking_findings(round, findings)` returns all validated findings in rounds 1–2 and only validated CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM findings in round 3+. A binary gate (test-green, security must-fix, required artifact) is exempt only when its owning invariant explicitly says so.
>
> | Round | Exit bar — loop ENDS when the fresh full review has… | Must be fixed to continue |
> | --- | --- | --- |
> | 1-2 | zero validated findings at ANY severity | CRITICAL · HIGH · MEDIUM · LOW |
> | 3+ | zero validated CRITICAL / HIGH / MEDIUM findings — **LOW-only is a PASS** | CRITICAL · HIGH · MEDIUM only |
>
> From round 3 onward LOW findings are **NOT required to be fixed**: a round whose validated findings are ALL LOW **ENDS the loop immediately** — do not open another round for them. Severity tiers are `SYNC:severity-rubric` (CRITICAL block-merge · HIGH must-fix · MEDIUM should-fix · LOW nice-to-fix); rounds 1-2 are unchanged, so an easy LOW still gets fixed early when it is cheap.
>
> **Severity-floor rules:**
>
> - **Never silently drop a deferred LOW.** Every unfixed LOW is listed in the final report under `## Deferred LOW Findings (severity floor, round ≥3)` with file, line, and description, so the owner can schedule it. Dropping it from the report is a protocol violation, not a clean pass.
> - **Never re-tier a finding to trigger the exit.** Downgrading a real CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM to LOW so the loop can end is a FALSE PASS. Severity is set by consequence per `SYNC:severity-rubric` before the round bar is applied — never after, and never with the exit in view. — why: a floor that can be reached by relabeling is not a floor.
> - **The floor bounds the loop, not the standard.** It ends *iteration*; it never authorizes shipping a known CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM, and it never lowers the finding-survival bar that admits a finding in the first place.
> - **The floor never applies to a hard gate.** Test-green gates (a suite must actually pass), security must-fix gates, and any gate whose criterion is binary rather than severity-rated are unaffected — a failing test is a failure, not a LOW finding.
>
> **Universal scope (any new output/judgment):** any newly produced output or judgment gets **≥1 self-review**; any **new judgment** gets **≥1 `/why-review --validate-findings` pass**; anything flagged to re-check is re-checked **≥1 time** — before that output is treated as final. This loop is the default convergence contract for ANY work-producing skill, not review skills only.
>
> **Routing invariant (author-facing):** a skill that validates findings MUST route them through `/why-review --validate-findings` (the terminal validator) — NEVER fork an inline finding-validation. Routing through why-review is what makes the finding-survival bar and this loop apply; the `verify-review-validate-coverage` sensor enforces this exact route mechanically.
>
> **Round 1:** Main-session review. Read target files, build understanding, note issues. Output findings + verdict (PASS / FAIL).
>
> **Decision after Round 1:**
>
> - **No issues found (PASS, zero findings)** → review ENDS. Do NOT spawn a fresh sub-agent for confirmation.
> - **`blocking_findings(round, findings)` is non-empty** → run the active review skill's findings-validation gate first; for review skills the default gate is `/why-review --validate-findings <report-path>`. Fix only validated findings, then restart the full review protocol from the beginning with a fresh task breakdown.
>
> **Fresh full re-review after every fix cycle:** Re-run the whole review protocol over the current full target. When sub-agents are part of that protocol, spawn NEW `Agent` calls — never reuse prior agents. Reviewers re-read ALL files from scratch with ZERO memory of prior rounds. See `SYNC:fresh-context-review` for the spawn mechanism and `SYNC:review-protocol-injection` for the canonical Agent prompt template. Each fresh full review must catch:
>
> - Cross-cutting concerns missed in the prior round
> - Interaction bugs between changed files
> - Convention drift (new code vs existing patterns)
> - Missing pieces that should exist but don't
> - Subtle edge cases the prior round rationalized away
> - Regressions introduced by the fixes themselves
>
> **Loop termination:** After each full re-review, repeat the same decision against **that round's exit bar**: bar cleared → END; blocking findings remain → validate findings → fix → restart from the first review phase. Rounds 1-2 clear on zero findings at any severity; **from round 3 the bar is zero CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM, so a LOW-only round ENDS the loop** (deferred LOWs go in the report). Capped at **3 rounds**. Escalate via `AskUserQuestion` at whichever comes first: the same validated finding repeats for 2 full invocations with no progress · a fix requires product/owner input · round 3 completes with CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM still open. NEVER loop past 3 rounds, and NEVER convert cap exhaustion into a PASS.
>
> **Rules:**
>
> - A clean Round 1 ENDS the review — no mandatory Round 2
> - From round 3 on, a round whose validated findings are ALL LOW ENDS the loop — never open round N+1 to fix LOW alone; list those LOWs as deferred instead
> - NEVER re-tier a CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM down to LOW to reach the round-3 exit — severity is assigned by consequence before the bar is applied
> - NEVER fix unvalidated findings; validate first using the caller's validation gate
> - Every surviving finding must additionally clear the **finding-survival bar** defined in why-review's Findings Validation Routine (a deliberately higher bar than the generic act-gate — "keep this finding?" is a stricter question than "act on this evidence?"); a finding below the bar is demoted or dropped, not kept
> - NEVER skip the full re-review after a fix cycle (every fix invalidates the prior verdict)
> - NEVER reuse a sub-agent across rounds — every iteration that uses sub-agents spawns NEW Agent calls
> - Main agent READS sub-agent reports but MUST NOT filter, reinterpret, or override findings
> - The 3-round cap NEVER replaces the clean-review requirement — it bounds runaway looping, it does not authorize shipping an un-clean review; a clean pass ends the loop early at any round, and cap exhaustion escalates rather than passes
> - Enforce the round cap of 3 alongside the 2 repeated-no-progress blocker rule; both are escalation triggers, neither is a completion criterion
> - Track recursive invocation count and repeated blockers in conversation context (session-scoped)
> - Final verdict must incorporate ALL rounds executed
>
> **Report must include `## Round N Findings (Fresh Sub-Agent)` for every round N≥2 that was executed, plus `## Deferred LOW Findings (severity floor, round ≥3)` whenever the loop ended on the round-3+ bar with LOWs still open.**

### Subagent Type Selection

- `code-reviewer` — for code reviews (reviewing source files, git diffs, implementation)
- `general-purpose` — for plan / doc / artifact reviews (reviewing markdown plans, docs, specs)

### Canonical Agent Call Template (Copy Verbatim)

```
Agent({
  description: "Fresh Round {N} review",
  subagent_type: "code-reviewer",
  prompt: `
## Task
{review-specific task — e.g., "Review all uncommitted changes for code quality" | "Review plan files under {plan-dir}" | "Review integration tests in {path}"}

## Round
Round {N}. You have ZERO memory of prior rounds. Re-read all target files from scratch via your own tool calls. Do NOT trust anything from the main agent beyond this prompt.

## Protocols (follow VERBATIM — these are non-negotiable)

### Spec ↔ Tests ↔ Code Triangulation
DO THIS FIRST — before any per-protocol check below. The review target is the WHOLE PACKAGE, not the diff alone: load the behavior's spec (§3 ACs / §4 BRs / §8 TCs), its tests, and the changed code TOGETHER, and reason about their mutual consistency BEFORE judging any one in isolation.
1. Locate all three faces: the Feature Spec section(s) governing the changed behavior, the tests that guard it, and the production code that implements it. A missing face is itself a finding (SPEC-GAP / TEST-GAP / DEAD-SPEC).
2. Triangulate pairwise — every disagreement is a finding; classify which face is wrong:
   - code vs spec: behavior the code does that no §3/§4/§8 rule describes → CODE-EXTRA or SPEC-STALE; a [HARD] §4 rule or §5 invariant with no enforcing code path → CODE-WRONG.
   - tests vs spec: a §8 TC with no test, or a test asserting behavior no TC/rule names → TEST-GAP or SPEC-SILENT.
   - tests vs code: a changed code path with no covering test → TEST-GAP; a test that still passes against a deliberately broken invariant → WEAK-TEST (apply the mutation thinking in Bug Detection).
3. Hidden-rule capture: any invariant the code enforces but the spec never states (SPEC-SILENT) MUST be surfaced as a finding to add into §3/§4/§8 AND guarded with a test — the enrichment loop, never a silent pass.
4. Only after the three faces agree — or every disagreement is logged as a finding — proceed to the per-protocol checks below; when enrichment adds spec/test content, re-review the package against the enriched spec.
NEVER mark review PASS while any spec/test/code face disagrees without a logged finding. The diff is the entry point; the package is the unit of judgment.

### Evidence-Based Reasoning
Speculation is FORBIDDEN. Every claim needs proof.
1. Cite file:line, grep results, or framework docs for EVERY claim
2. Declare confidence: >80% act freely, 60-80% verify first, <60% DO NOT recommend
3. Cross-service validation required for architectural changes
4. "I don't have enough evidence" is valid and expected output
BLOCKED until: Evidence file path (file:line) provided; Grep search performed; 3+ similar patterns found; Confidence level stated.
Forbidden without proof: "obviously", "I think", "should be", "probably", "this is because".
If incomplete → output: "Insufficient evidence. Verified: [...]. Not verified: [...]."

### Bug Detection
MUST check categories 1-4 for EVERY review. Never skip.
1. Null Safety: Can params/returns be null? Are they guarded? Optional chaining gaps? .find() returns checked?
2. Boundary Conditions: Off-by-one (< vs <=)? Empty collections handled? Zero/negative values? Max limits?
3. Error Handling: Try-catch scope correct? Silent swallowed exceptions? Error types specific? Cleanup in finally?
4. Resource Management: Connections/streams closed? Subscriptions unsubscribed on destroy? Timers cleared? Memory bounded?
5. Concurrency (if async): Missing await? Race conditions on shared state? Stale closures? Retry storms?
6. Stack-Specific: Check the configured language/runtime pitfalls and framework-specific failure modes discovered from local code.
Classify: CRITICAL (crash/corrupt) → FAIL | HIGH (incorrect behavior) → FAIL | MEDIUM (edge case) → WARN | LOW (defensive) → INFO.

### Design Patterns Quality
Priority checks for every code change:
1. DRY via OOP: Same-suffix classes (*Entity, *Dto, *Service) MUST share base class. 3+ similar patterns → extract to shared abstraction.
2. Right Responsibility: Logic in LOWEST layer (Entity > Domain Service > Application Service > Controller). Never business logic in controllers.
3. SOLID: Single responsibility (one reason to change). Open-closed (extend, don't modify). Liskov (subtypes substitutable). Interface segregation (small interfaces). Dependency inversion (depend on abstractions).
4. After extraction/move/rename: Grep ENTIRE scope for dangling references. Zero tolerance.
5. YAGNI gate: Recommend extraction when 3+ similar patterns exist OR an evidenced consumer boundary/substitution need justifies it; do not create patterns for hypothetical future use.
6. Purpose-oriented naming: Name public or cross-layer abstractions by the capability, domain purpose, or contract consumers rely on—not the current provider, SDK, framework, database, or transport. `IStorage`/`Storage` → `AzureBlobStorage`; use `IAzureStorage` only when Azure-specific semantics are intentionally part of the contract.
7. Contract-fit check: Read callers and every implementation before judging a name; narrow an over-broad abstraction (`IObjectStore`, `DocumentStore`) instead of rewarding a generic name that lies about behavior.
8. Mechanism/generic-name smell: Treat `Manager`, `Helper`, `Utils`, `Data`, `Thing`, `Service`, `Interface`, type decorations, and unexplained abbreviations as review signals—not automatic defects; flag them only when they hide purpose, scope, or responsibility.
9. Concrete implementation names: Provider, strategy, transport, or test-double names are valid on concrete types when they distinguish real behavior (`AzureBlobStorage`, `InMemoryStorage`, `RetryingStorage`); keep those details out of the caller-facing contract unless the contract promises them.
10. Language convention: Preserve local interface syntax and naming style; `.NET` `I` prefixes and Google TypeScript's unmarked interfaces are both valid local conventions.
Anti-patterns to flag: God Object, Copy-Paste inheritance, Circular Dependency, Leaky Abstraction.

### Logic & Intention Review
Verify WHAT code does matches WHY it was changed.
1. Change Intention Check: Every changed file MUST serve the stated purpose. Flag unrelated changes as scope creep.
2. Happy Path Trace: Walk through one complete success scenario through changed code.
3. Error Path Trace: Walk through one failure/edge case scenario through changed code.
4. Acceptance Mapping: If plan context available, map every acceptance criterion to a code change.
5. Tests Verify Intent: For test/spec changes, verify tests name the protected business rule or invariant and would fail if that intent breaks.
6. Migration Test Exclusion: Do not write tests for migration code. Schema/data migrations are one-time execution paths, not core application logic.
NEVER mark review PASS without completing both traces (happy + error path).

### Test Spec Verification
Map changed code to test specifications.
1. Identify the project's test/spec format from existing docs, test-case files, BDD feature files, or spec folders.
2. Every changed code path MUST map to a corresponding test case/spec (or flag as "needs test case").
3. New functions/endpoints/handlers → flag for test spec creation.
4. Migration files are excluded from test/spec creation; schema/data migrations are one-time execution paths, not core application logic.
5. If spec evidence fields exist, verify they point to actual code (file:line, not stale references).
6. Verify each meaningful test case names the business intent/invariant; flag behavior-only cases that only mirror implementation details.
7. Auth/data changes → verify corresponding authorization and data-state test cases exist.
8. If no specs exist for a changed path → log the gap and recommend the project's test-spec workflow.
NEVER skip test mapping. Untested code paths are the #1 source of production bugs.

### Behavioral Delta Matrix
MANDATORY for any bugfix review. Produce input-state × pre-fix × post-fix × delta table BEFORE writing verdict.
- Minimum 3 rows; include at least one row OUTSIDE the original bug report.
- Any "REGRESSION" delta → review returns FAIL until a preservation test is added.
- Narrative descriptions do NOT substitute for the matrix.
Example rows (external-record sync fix):
| Input                 | Pre-fix | Post-fix                  | Delta      |
| --------------------- | ------- | ------------------------- | ---------- |
| Record exists (valid) | Reused  | Always recreated → orphan | REGRESSION |
| Record missing (404)  | Error   | Recreated                 | Fixed      |

### Fix-Layer Accountability
NEVER fix at the crash site. Trace the full flow, fix at the owning layer. The crash site is a SYMPTOM, not the cause.
MANDATORY before ANY fix:
1. Trace full data flow — Map the complete path from data origin to crash site across ALL layers (storage → backend → API → frontend → UI). Identify where bad state ENTERS, not where it CRASHES.
2. Identify the invariant owner — Which layer's contract guarantees this value is valid? Fix at the LOWEST layer that owns the invariant, not the highest layer that consumes it.
3. One fix, maximum protection — If fix requires touching 3+ files with defensive checks, you are at the wrong layer — go lower.
4. Verify no bypass paths — Confirm all data flows through the fix point. Check for direct construction skipping factories, clone/spread without re-validation, raw data not wrapped in domain models, mutations outside the model layer.
BLOCKED until: Full data flow traced (origin → crash); Invariant owner identified with file:line evidence; All access sites audited (grep count); Fix layer justified (lowest layer that protects most consumers).
Anti-patterns (REJECT): "Fix it where it crashes" (crash site ≠ cause site, trace upstream); "Add defensive checks at every consumer" (scattered defense = wrong layer); "Both fix is safer" (pick ONE authoritative layer).

### Rationalization Prevention
AI skips steps via these evasions. Recognize and reject:
- "Too simple for a plan" → Simple + wrong assumptions = wasted time. Plan anyway.
- "I'll test after" → RED before GREEN. Write/verify test first.
- "Already searched" → Show grep evidence with file:line. No proof = no search.
- "Just do it" → Still need TaskCreate. Skip depth, never skip tracking.
- "Just a small fix" → Small fix in wrong location cascades. Verify file:line first.
- "Code is self-explanatory" → Future readers need evidence trail. Document anyway.
- "Combine steps to save time" → Combined steps dilute focus. Each step has distinct purpose.

### Graph-Assisted Investigation
MANDATORY when .code-graph/graph.db exists.
HARD-GATE: MUST run at least ONE graph command on key files before concluding any investigation.
Pattern: Grep finds files → trace --direction both reveals full system flow → Grep verifies details.
- Investigation/Scout: trace --direction both on 2-3 entry files
- Fix/Debug: callers_of on buggy function + tests_for
- Feature/Enhancement: connections on files to be modified
- Code Review: tests_for on changed functions
- Blast Radius: trace --direction downstream
CLI: python .claude/scripts/code_graph {command} --json. Use --node-mode file first (10-30x less noise), then --node-mode function for detail.

### Understand Code First
HARD-GATE: Do NOT write, plan, or fix until you READ existing code.
1. Search 3+ similar patterns (grep/glob) — cite file:line evidence.
2. Read existing files in target area — understand structure, base classes, conventions.
3. Run python .claude/scripts/code_graph trace <file> --direction both --json when .code-graph/graph.db exists.
4. Map dependencies via connections or callers_of — know what depends on your target.
5. Write investigation to .ai/workspace/analysis/ for non-trivial tasks (3+ files).
6. Re-read analysis file before implementing — never work from memory alone.
7. NEVER invent new patterns when existing ones work — match exactly or document deviation.
BLOCKED until: Read target files; Grep 3+ patterns; Graph trace (if graph.db exists); Assumptions verified with evidence.

## Reference Docs (READ before reviewing)
- `.claude/docs/development-rules.md` — canonical development rules, code-quality guidelines, and pre-commit checklist
- docs/project-reference/code-review-rules.md
- {skill-specific reference docs — e.g., integration-test-reference.md for integration-test-review; backend-patterns-reference.md for backend reviews; frontend-patterns-reference.md for frontend reviews}

## Target Files
{explicit file list OR "run git diff to see uncommitted changes" OR "read all files under {plan-dir}"}

## Output
Write a structured report to plans/reports/{review-type}-round{N}-{date}.md with sections:
- Status: PASS | FAIL
- Issue Count: {number}
- Critical Issues (with file:line evidence)
- High Priority Issues (with file:line evidence)
- Medium / Low Issues
- Cross-cutting findings

Return the report path and status to the main agent.
Every finding MUST have file:line evidence. Speculation is forbidden.
`
})
```

### Rules

- DO copy the template wholesale — including all 11 embedded protocol sections
- DO replace only the `{placeholders}` in Task / Round / Reference Docs / Target Files / Output sections with context-specific content
- DO choose `code-reviewer` subagent_type for code reviews and `general-purpose` for plan / doc / artifact reviews
- DO NOT paraphrase, summarize, or skip any protocol section
- DO NOT pass file contents inline — the sub-agent reads via its own tool calls so it has a fresh context
- DO NOT reference protocols by file path or tag name — the bodies are already embedded above
- DO NOT introduce placeholder markers for the protocols — they must stay literally expanded

<!-- SYNC:ai-mistake-prevention -->

> **AI Mistake Prevention** — Failure modes to avoid on every task:
>
> **Re-read files after context changes.** Context compaction, resume, or long-running work can make memory stale; verify current files before acting.
> **Verify generated content against source evidence.** AI hallucinates APIs, names, claims, and document facts. Check the relevant source before documenting or referencing.
> **Check downstream references before deleting or renaming.** Removing an artifact can stale docs, generated mirrors, configs, and callers; map references first.
> **Trace the full impact chain after edits.** Changing a definition can miss derived outputs and consumers. Follow the affected chain before declaring done.
> **Verify ALL affected outputs, not just the first.** One green check is not all green checks; validate every output surface the change can affect.
> **Assume existing values are intentional — ask WHY before changing OR flagging one as a defect.** Before changing or reporting a constant, limit, flag, cutoff, wording, or pattern, read nearby context and history, the CALLER's ordering, and 2+ sibling call sites of the same convention. A doc stating WHAT without WHY is missing rationale, not proof of a missing guard.
> **Surface ambiguity before acting — don't pick silently.** Multiple valid interpretations require an explicit question or stated assumption with risk.
> **Assert the outcome your system owns, not the intermediate state your infrastructure owns.** When verifying async work, assert the final business state — never the delivery/retry bookkeeping held in shared infrastructure that any co-running process can write.

<!-- SYNC:trade-off-interrogation-gate -->

> **Trade-Off Interrogation Gate** — ALWAYS ask these THREE questions before ANY verdict, score, finding, or recommendation — about the thing under review AND about every recommendation YOU make. — why: naming a benefit without its price is an endorsement, not a review; the costliest trade-offs are the ones nobody wrote down.
>
> 1. **Is there any trade-off?** Name what it SACRIFICES. "None" / "pure win" is an unfinished analysis, NOT an answer — to claim none, state which dimensions you checked and why each is unaffected: future change cost · complexity · performance/latency · memory/cost · coupling · reversibility · migration burden · operational load · blast radius · security posture · testability · team skill/ramp · delivery time · UX.
> 2. **Is it worth it?** Weigh gain against sacrifice EXPLICITLY — what is gained (with a metric) · what it costs · WHO pays · WHEN it comes due — then emit **WORTH IT / NOT WORTH IT / UNCLEAR**. "Better" with no metric and no cost FAILS this question. NOT WORTH IT → withdraw or replace the recommendation, never keep it as-is.
> 3. **Is the trade-off material enough to CONFIRM WITH THE USER?** A material trade-off is the user's call, never yours. **MATERIAL** when ANY holds: irreversible / one-way door (data migration, public contract, storage format, vendor lock-in) · cost shifted onto someone else (another team, ops/on-call, future maintainer, end user) · one quality attribute traded for another (correctness↔speed, security↔convenience, latency↔cost, simplicity↔flexibility) · a boundary crossed (client↔server tier, service contract, event contract, shared library) · a high-consequence path (auth, money, data integrity, breaking change, High/Medium residual risk) · the worth-it verdict is UNCLEAR.
>
> **MATERIAL → STOP and confirm via `AskUserQuestion` BEFORE the verdict stands** — state the trade-off, both options, what each sacrifices, and your recommendation. **NOT material →** record it inline with a one-line justification and proceed.
>
> **Non-asking execution contexts — ESCALATE BY HANDOFF, never by silence.** `AskUserQuestion` reaches only the main interactive agent: a sub-agent cannot ask the user, and a terminal/verdict-only mode asks nothing by design. When you are running in such a context, the obligation is **redirected, never waived** — do ALL of: (a) complete questions 1 and 2 normally; (b) decide materiality and record it in the Trade-Off Assessment row with `confirmed? = NO — cannot ask from this context`; (c) **name the unconfirmed MATERIAL trade-off explicitly in your returned summary/verdict so the CALLER (or parent orchestrator) escalates it via `AskUserQuestion` on your behalf** — a material trade-off mentioned only inside a report file on disk is NOT a handoff; (d) do not emit an unqualified PASS — mark the verdict as carrying an unconfirmed material trade-off, so the caller's gate stays closed until the user answers. The caller inherits the escalation duty the moment it reads your return.
>
> This carve-out is about **reachability, not convenience**: it applies ONLY where the tool genuinely cannot reach the user (spawned sub-agent, terminal validate/verdict-only mode, non-interactive/headless run). It is NEVER a licence to skip the question, to self-approve a one-way door, or to downgrade materiality because asking is inconvenient — if you CAN ask, you MUST ask.

<!-- SYNC:domain-entity-change-gate -->

> **Domain Entity Change Gate** — ONE protocol binding every skill or agent that PLANS, IMPLEMENTS, or REVIEWS a change touching a domain entity, value object, or aggregate, so a planner, an implementer, and a reviewer apply the SAME rules to the SAME change. `/domain-entities-review` is the canonical owner of the full A–P checklist; this gate is the shared trigger plus the decision set that must be answered. NEVER re-derive a weaker local copy — why: when planning and review disagree on entity rules, the plan ships a design that review then rejects, and the rework is paid twice.
>
> **Trigger — fires when ANY holds:** a new entity / value object / aggregate root is introduced · an existing one gains or loses a field, invariant, relationship, or state transition · an aggregate boundary, repository, or cross-aggregate reference changes · a domain event is added, renamed, or re-payloaded · a concurrency or reconstitution concern on a root changes. State `No domain-entity surface — gate N/A` when none holds.
>
> **Step 1 — Detect BEFORE deciding.** Both answers change which rules even apply:
>
> - **Paradigm** (per aggregate, from the code — NEVER assumed): OO-mutable · type-driven/immutable · event-sourced. Setter, mutability, and reconstitution rules are written for OO-mutable; applying them to the other two manufactures false findings and false plan tasks.
> - **Subdomain fit:** core (rich model owed) · supporting (Active Record or light model) · generic (buy, do not model) · CRUD (Transaction Script — a rich entity here is ceremony). NEVER plan or flag a rich model where the subdomain has no invariant beyond required-field.
>
> **Step 2 — Answer all 6 decision points.** Each is a decision the change MUST make explicitly:
>
> | # | Decision point | Answered when |
> | - | -------------- | ------------- |
> | 1 | **Classification** — entity vs value object vs aggregate root | The swap test is applied ("would an identical copy be interchangeable?"); a VO is immutable with structural equality and has no repository |
> | 2 | **Invariant ownership** — entity owns "can this state exist?", the boundary owns "is this input acceptable?" | Each rule is placed on one side and named; failure signalling (throw vs `Result`) matches the project convention consistently; a DB constraint is a backstop, NEVER the rule |
> | 3 | **Aggregate boundary + concurrency** | Only true always-consistent invariants share an aggregate; cross-aggregate references are by ID; one aggregate mutates per transaction; the ROOT carries the concurrency token; set-based invariants (uniqueness across instances) name a real enforcing mechanism, never an in-memory check |
> | 4 | **Construction vs reconstitution** | Creation and load are separate paths; the load path raises NO domain events and re-runs NO creation rules; required data sits in the constructor/factory |
> | 5 | **Events** | Raised inside the aggregate; dispatched AFTER commit (outbox when crossing a process); internal domain events kept distinct from published integration contracts; handlers idempotent |
> | 6 | **Test obligation** | Every invariant maps to a universally-quantified property TC PLUS a boundary counter-case — the spec NAMES it and a test GUARDS it (Dual-Feedback); a single happy-path example is NOT coverage |
>
> **Step 3 — Apply by context.** Same decisions, different obligation:
>
> | Calling context | Obligation |
> | --------------- | ---------- |
> | **Planning** (`/plan`) | The plan MUST name the decision and the owning file for every triggered row. An unanswered row is a plan that is not executable — surface it, do NOT let implementation discover it. |
> | **Plan review** (`/plan-review`) | An unanswered, hand-waved, or deferred-to-implementation row is a FINDING with `file:line` into the plan. Presence of the word "entity" is NEVER an answer. |
> | **Implementation** (`/plan-execute`, `/fix`, and any implementing agent — e.g. `backend-developer`) | The decisions are INPUTS, not questions to reopen: implement each triggered row as the plan/spec decided it, at the owning file it named. A row that arrives UNANSWERED is a blocker — surface it and get it decided; NEVER settle it silently at the keyboard, and NEVER pick an aggregate boundary from a DB table or UI screen because the plan left it open. Paradigm and subdomain fit still gate which rules apply. |
> | **Change review** (`/changes-review`) | Route to the owner — **Mode A (default):** read `/domain-entities-review`'s Phase 2 A–P checklist and apply it as review lenses. **Mode B (escalation):** delegate to `/domain-entities-review` when standalone AND the diff carries 3+ entity files. Findings enter the normal finding set with `file:line` + severity. |
>
> **Duplication guard — SKIP the gate entirely when ANY row holds.** Record the deferral line, then proceed:

**MUST ATTENTION** when the change PLANS or REVIEWS a new/updated domain entity, value object, or aggregate, apply the **Domain Entity Change Gate** — `/domain-entities-review` owns the full A–P checklist; detect paradigm + subdomain fit FIRST, then answer all 6 decision points (classification · invariant ownership + failure signalling · aggregate boundary + concurrency · construction vs reconstitution · events · property-TC test obligation). Planning must NAME each decision; plan review treats an unanswered row as a FINDING; change review routes to the owner (Mode A read / Mode B delegate).

- **MANDATORY MUST ATTENTION ALWAYS ASK THE 3 TRADE-OFF QUESTIONS** — on the thing under review AND on every recommendation you make: (1) **is there any trade-off?** name what it SACRIFICES (change cost · complexity · perf · coupling · reversibility · migration · ops load · blast radius · security · testability · delivery time · UX) — "none"/"pure win" is an unfinished analysis, so state the dimensions checked; (2) **is it worth it?** gain (with a metric) vs cost, WHO pays, WHEN → emit **WORTH IT / NOT WORTH IT / UNCLEAR**; NOT WORTH IT → withdraw or replace it; (3) **is it material enough to confirm with the user?** irreversible/one-way door · cost shifted onto another team/ops/maintainer/user · one quality attribute traded for another · a tier/service/event/library boundary crossed · auth/money/data-integrity/breaking-change/High-or-Medium-risk path · verdict UNCLEAR → **STOP and confirm via `AskUserQuestion` BEFORE the verdict**.
- **MANDATORY** A MATERIAL trade-off with no user confirmation can NEVER be PASS; NEVER bury one as a Low-severity note, NEVER decide it silently, and NEVER let delivery or convergence pressure authorize a one-way door. — why: an un-walked-back one-way door is the user's call to make, not the reviewer's.
- **MANDATORY — non-asking contexts escalate BY HANDOFF, never by silence.** `AskUserQuestion` reaches only the main interactive agent: a sub-agent cannot ask the user, and a terminal/verdict-only mode asks nothing by design. There the duty is REDIRECTED, not waived — still name the trade-off, still decide materiality, record `confirmed? = NO — cannot ask from this context`, **state the unconfirmed MATERIAL trade-off in your RETURNED verdict/summary so the CALLER escalates it** (a note only in an on-disk report is not a handoff), and never emit an unqualified PASS. Applies ONLY where the user is genuinely unreachable (spawned sub-agent, terminal validate mode, headless run) — if you CAN ask, you MUST ask.

<!-- SYNC:parallel-subagent-dispatch -->

> **Parallel Sub-Agent Dispatch** — Plan parallelism the moment a task breakdown exists, BEFORE executing it — running provably independent tasks sequentially wastes wall-clock. Applies to every multi-step job: workflow steps, planning, batch updates, investigation, research, scans, reviews, doc sync. **Plan execution is metadata-gated, NEVER default-parallel** — fan-out follows ONLY what the plan declares (`PAR`/`SEQ` tags + per-phase write set); an untagged plan runs sequentially — why: a derived write set cannot see cascade or generated writes.
>
> 1. **Tag every task `PAR` or `SEQ`.** `PAR` = inputs exclude every pending task's output AND write set disjoint from every other `PAR`. Else `SEQ` — MUST ATTENTION name the dependency forcing it.
> 2. **Group `PAR` into waves.** No edge between members. Two writers of one file NEVER share a wave. Read-only work (search, investigation, review, research) parallelizes freely.
> 3. **Declare before dispatch:** `Parallel plan: wave 1 = [...] · wave 2 = [...] · SEQ = [...] (reason)`.
> 4. **Spawn each wave in ONE message** — every `Agent` call in one response, NEVER dripped per turn. Route each task to its specialist (`.claude/skills/shared/sub-agent-selection-guide.md`); NEVER `code-reviewer` as catch-all.
> 5. **Brief each sub-agent self-contained:** goal · scope + owned files · reference docs · return contract (summary + `Full report:` path, per SYNC:subagent-return-contract) · incremental persistence to `plans/reports/` (per SYNC:incremental-persistence).
> 6. **Barrier per wave.** Advance ONLY after EVERY member returns (a skipped conditional counts as returned). Merge, mark each task completed/skipped, THEN dispatch the next wave. Mutating steps wait for the barrier.
> 7. **One level deep.** A dispatched sub-agent executes its own brief; further fan-out stays the orchestrator's job unless that agent's `.claude/agents/*.md` definition authorizes it.
>
> **NEVER parallelize:** tasks sharing a write target · a task consuming a pending task's output · trivial single-file work (dispatch overhead > gain) · an order a skill or workflow explicitly fixes · gates awaiting user approval.
>
> **Blocked until:** MUST ATTENTION every task tagged PAR/SEQ with a named reason per SEQ · waves declared + write-set disjointness checked · each wave spawned in ONE message · barrier honored before the next wave.

<!-- SYNC:parallel-subagent-dispatch:reminder -->

- **MANDATORY** After planning tasks, tag each PAR/SEQ and spawn every PAR wave as parallel sub-agents in ONE message — default parallel for workflows, batch updates, investigation, research, reviews; plan execution fans out ONLY on what the plan declares.
- **MANDATORY** Disjoint write sets per wave · all-return barrier before the next wave · specialist routing · sub-agents NEVER fan out further unless their own agent definition authorizes it.

<!-- SYNC:project-protocol-overlay -->

> **Project Protocol Overlay** — Before executing this skill, resolve any PROJECT overlay rules layered onto it: match this skill's name against the `Target` column of the project's skill-protocol index (`docs/project-reference/skill-protocols-reference.md` by default; a `referenceDocs` entry in `docs/project-config.json` overrides the path), taking the most specific matching tier ONLY — exact name > glob > `*`. **That precedence orders overlays against EACH OTHER, never against this skill.** Read ONLY the matched bodies, resolved as `<protocols-dir>/<Name>.md`; a row's Body link is display text, never a read path. A matched body that is missing or malformed is REPORTED and skipped — never reconstructed from the index Description. No index, or no match -> proceed with no overlay, silently. Full contract: `.claude/skills/project-skill-protocol/references/registry.md`.
>
> Overlays are **ADDITIVE ONLY**: they ADD rules on top of this skill's own protocol and NEVER replace, override, disable, or reinterpret a rule it already states — removing every overlay must return this skill to exactly its documented behavior. An overlay is a BRIEF, not an authority escalation: it can NEVER waive a workflow gate, git discipline, a review gate, or a user-confirmation gate. A genuine overlay-vs-skill conflict, or two equally-specific overlays that directly contradict -> surface both to the user; NEVER resolve silently.

<!-- /SYNC:project-protocol-overlay -->

<!-- SYNC:project-protocol-overlay:reminder -->

**MUST ATTENTION** resolve project protocol overlays for this skill BEFORE executing — most specific matching tier only (exact > glob > `*`, which ranks overlays against each other, NEVER against this skill), read only matched bodies at `<protocols-dir>/<Name>.md`; a missing or malformed body is reported, never reconstructed. Overlays are ADDITIVE ONLY (they never replace this skill's own rules) and are a brief, NEVER an authority escalation; an equal-specificity contradiction goes to the user.

## Closing Reminders

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION Goal:** Block any plan reaching implementation unless hallucination-free (every existing-code claim proven at `file:line`) AND implementation-ready (every step concrete, small enough to code from immediately) — recursive review until a complete pass finds zero findings.

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION Main steps (run in order, one task each):** Phase 0 detect plan type → Step 1 read `plan.md`/`goal.md`/all `phase-*.md` → Step 2 evaluate the 4 checklist groups (Validity · Correctness [Granularity + Anti-Hallucination + spec/TC coverage + Goal-Contract mapping] · Best Practices · Completeness) + 11 Adversarial techniques + Anti-Bias Gate + 8 Plan Dimensions + graph-trace each modified file → Step 3 score PASS/WARN/FAIL → Step 4 output result → Step 5 recursive `/why-review`-validate → fix validated findings → full re-review until zero findings — why: AI keeps forgetting the skill's own step pipeline; this is the read-this-if-nothing-else order.

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** Protocols in force (concise digest of the SYNC/shared blocks this skill carries) — each line is a signpost to its canonical body above; NEVER treat the digest as a substitute for the full block, and ALWAYS apply every protocol below in full:

- **Behavioral Delta Matrix:** bugfix reviews need input × pre × post × delta table before verdict.
- **Graph-Assisted Investigation:** run one graph command on key files when graph.db exists.
- **Cross-Service Check:** scan producers, consumers, sagas, contracts; missing consumer = silent regression.
- **Fresh Context Review:** spawn zero-memory sub-agent re-reading from scratch after each fix cycle.
- **Nested Task Creation:** expand child phase tasks; link the parent workflow row when nested.
- **Task Tracking & External Report:** bootstrap task breakdown; persist findings to `plans/reports/` incrementally.
- **Critical Thinking:** every claim needs traced `file:line` proof; never present guess as fact.
- **Sequential Thinking:** multi-step Thought N/M with REVISION/BRANCH/HYPOTHESIS markers and confidence closer.
- **Project Reference Docs:** read required project-reference docs before target work; conventions override generic defaults.
- **Understand Code First:** grep 3+ patterns and read code before any modification.
- **Double Round-Trip Review:** review → validate findings → fix → full re-review until clean.
- **Review Protocol Injection:** embed all 11 protocol bodies verbatim into every fresh review prompt.
- **AI Mistake Prevention:** verify generated content against evidence, trace downstream references, verify all affected outputs, re-read after context loss, surface ambiguity.
- **Severity Rubric:** classify Critical/High/Medium/Low by consequence; Critical/High block PASS.
- **Parallel Sub-Agent Dispatch:** Tag tasks PAR/SEQ, group PAR into disjoint-write-set waves, spawn each wave in ONE message, barrier before advancing.

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** review as SKEPTIC not validator — your job: find what cannot work, not confirm what looks right; run the full Anti-Bias Gate (reality check, assumption stress-test, pre-mortem, steel-man rejected alternative, contrarian pass) BEFORE any verdict — why: confirmation bias rubber-stamps well-structured plans.
**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** Anti-Hallucination Gate — every plan claim about existing source code needs `file:line` proof (file exists, symbol grepped, behavior code-traced); "should be"/"probably"/"typically" about existing code = FAIL. Greenfield-only plans → PASS.
**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** Granularity Gate "Detailed & Small Enough" — FAIL any phase >5 files OR >3h OR carrying planning verbs (research/determine/decide/evaluate/explore/investigate); too vague → detail it (file paths, exact method names), too big → break it into sibling phases/sub-plans — why: a plan you can't immediately code from is NOT ready.
**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** detect plan type FIRST (Phase 0) — bugfix MANDATES the Behavioral Delta Matrix (≥3 rows, ≥1 outside the bug report, any REGRESSION → FAIL until a preservation test covers it); security/perf/refactor/contract/infra each add their own focus.
**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** spec-loop scheduling — plan must schedule property/invariant test specs for every `[HARD]` §4 rule / §5 invariant + a MUTATION-SCORE quality bar; FAIL a plan targeting a line-coverage % instead of a mutation-score bar.
**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** when ANY finding exists, run `/why-review --validate-findings` BEFORE editing any `plan.md`/`phase-*.md`; fix ONLY validated findings at the smallest responsible location, then restart the FULL review with a fresh zero-memory sub-agent — loop until a clean pass; NEVER edit plan files before this gate passes — why: unvalidated fixes corrupt the plan and waste review rounds.
**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** round cap 3 — a CEILING, never a target: a clean pass ends the loop immediately at any round; escalate via `AskUserQuestion` when the SAME blocker survives 2 consecutive full re-reviews with no progress, when round 3 completes with findings still open, or when a finding needs product/owner judgment. NEVER loop past 3 rounds and NEVER convert cap exhaustion into a PASS.
**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** bootstrap `TaskCreate` task breakdown BEFORE reads/grep/edits (one task per file read); persist findings to `plans/reports/{skill}-{YYMMDD}-{HHmm}-{slug}.md` incrementally and synthesize from disk; add a final review task — why: long plan files exhaust context, the report file is ground truth.
**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** run a graph trace on each "files to modify" entry when `.code-graph/graph.db` exists; flag any downstream file NOT listed in the plan as "potentially missed" — why: catches cross-service/event-handler impact the author overlooked.
**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** Dimension 7 — Estimation Drift: re-derive `bottom_up_hours = Σ phase_hours` from the FINALIZED phase files per the carried `SYNC:estimation-framework` and compare against frontmatter. `|delta| > 20%` → frontmatter MUST carry `reestimate_delta_pct` + a 1-line `reestimate_reason`, and a missing update is a FAIL; `|delta| > 50%` → flag `SHOULD-RESCOPE` and surface the rescope decision to the user BEFORE implementation — why: pre-completion estimates anchor on a scope guess, and locked phases are the first place the real cost is visible.
**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** Dimension 8 — Domain Entity Design (CONDITIONAL): when the plan touches an entity, value object, or aggregate, apply `SYNC:domain-entity-change-gate` — the SAME protocol `/plan` authored under and `/changes-review` reviews under. An unanswered, hand-waved, or deferred-to-implementation decision point is a FINDING with `file:line` into the plan; the word "entity" in a task is NEVER an answer. Verify paradigm + subdomain fit are stated BEFORE any entity task, and that each triggered row names its OWNING FILE. State `No domain-entity surface — Dimension 8 N/A` when it does not fire — why: an aggregate boundary chosen by DB table or UI screen is the costliest decision to reverse after implementation.
**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** standalone runs end with `AskUserQuestion` presenting findings + next-step options; skip ONLY inside a workflow.
**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** cite `file:line` evidence for every finding (confidence >80% to act, <60% DO NOT recommend); NEVER mark PASS while any spec/test/code face disagrees without a logged finding.
**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** READ before reviewing: `.claude/docs/development-rules.md`, `docs/project-reference/code-review-rules.md`, `lessons.md`, plus skill-specific pattern refs (backend/frontend/integration-test).

**Anti-Rationalization:**

| Evasion | Rebuttal |
| ------- | -------- |
| "Plan looks reasonable" | Structure ≠ correctness. Prove every existing-code claim with `file:line`; plausible text is not evidence. |
| "Phases are well-defined" | Presence of phases ≠ implementable. Apply the 5-point Granularity Gate per phase. |
| "One review pass enough" | Re-review only after a validated-finding fix cycle; a clean COMPLETE pass ends the loop. |
| "Implementation can fill gaps" | FAIL vague steps now — implementation executes the plan, it does not invent it. |
| "Alternatives were considered" | Were they real, or strawmen set up to fail? Steel-man the rejected one. |
| "Risk is managed" | "Monitor closely" is not a mitigation. Demand action, owner, trigger. |
| "Already traced the code" | Show `file:line` / grep evidence. No proof = no trace. |

**[TASK-PLANNING]** Before acting, analyze task scope and systematically break it into small todo tasks and sub-tasks using `TaskCreate`; add a final review task.

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION Goal:** Block any plan reaching implementation unless hallucination-free (`file:line` proof) AND implementation-ready (concrete, small-enough phases) — loop until a clean pass.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** review as SKEPTIC — `file:line` proof for every existing-code claim; FAIL vague/oversized phases; bugfix → Behavioral Delta Matrix.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** validate findings via `/why-review --validate-findings` before editing plan files; fix only validated findings; restart full review until zero findings.
