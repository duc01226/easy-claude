## Quick Summary

**Goal:** [Workflow] Trigger Greenfield Project Init workflow — full waterfall project inception from idea through implementation with integration testing.

**Summary:**

- Begin with the shared large-idea classification and embedded decomposition contract; run `$scenario` before the first plan when the outcome slices require adversarial risk analysis. A roadmap artifact is not a default greenfield prerequisite.
- Research the product, domain, technology, architecture, and foundation in order; scaffold and review the foundation before feature work.
- Every generated PBI MUST pass the Releasable Outcome Gate: one independently releasable actor-facing outcome with a complete entry-to-result journey; foundation/scaffold/setup work is enabling work attached to that outcome, never a standalone technical PBI. UI PBIs require the full page/view, navigation, component, state, and mock-app flow surface.
- Preserve the full spec/PBI/story/test chain and finish with implementation, integration verification, synchronized evidence, and handoff.

 - **Main steps:** classify/decompose → research → domain/tech/architecture → scenario/plan/review → PBI/story/mock-up/spec gates → scaffold/lint/harness/architecture review → implementation/integration verification → final review/security/test/docs/handoff.

**Workflow:**

1. **Detect** — classify request scope and target artifacts.
2. **Execute** — apply required steps with evidence-backed actions.
3. **Verify** — confirm constraints, output quality, and completion evidence.

**Key Rules:**

- MUST ATTENTION keep claims evidence-based (`file:line`) with confidence >80% to act.
- MUST ATTENTION keep task tracking updated as each step starts/completes.
- MUST ATTENTION define success criteria before execution and loop until observable verification passes.
- MUST ATTENTION when creating/reviewing specs or tests, name `Business Intent / Invariant Guarded` or the protected business intent/invariant and ensure the test would fail if that intent breaks.
- MUST ATTENTION classify the greenfield idea with `isLargeIdea = multipleIndependentOutcomes || ambiguousOrResearchHeavy || releaseScopeDecomposition || oversizedPbiThatMustSplit` before market research, architecture, specs, PBIs, or plans. When true, require the complete embedded `large_idea_decomposition` block in the owning PBI/spec with `outcome_slices`, `dependencies_order`, `non_goals`, `risks_evidence`, and `deferred_work_owner`, then carry stable slice IDs into stories, mock-ups, and the all-PBI presentation; run `$scenario` only when the selected scope needs adversarial risk analysis, otherwise record the conditional skip with evidence. An explicit roadmap request may use the standalone writer separately.
- NEVER skip mandatory workflow or skill gates.

## Repeated Steps Disambiguation (CRITICAL for task creation)

This workflow has steps that appear multiple times. When creating tasks, use these descriptions to distinguish them:

| Step                                 | Occurrence   | Task Description                                                                          |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/plan`                              | 1st (pos 14) | PLAN₁: High-level architecture plan (after architecture-design and conditional decomposition scenario gate) |
| `/plan`                              | 2nd (pos 34) | PLAN₂: Sprint-ready implementation plan (after artifact-review --type=spec-tests)         |
| `/plan`                              | 3rd (pos 50) | PLAN₃: Integration test architecture plan (post-implementation)                           |
| `/plan-review`                       | 1st (pos 15) | Review PLAN₁ architecture (immediate gate; replaces former rationale why-review)          |
| `/plan-review`                       | 2nd (pos 18) | Re-review PLAN₁ after architecture-security + performance analysis                        |
| `/plan-review`                       | 3rd (pos 35) | Review PLAN₂ implementation                                                               |
| `/plan-review`                       | 4th (pos 51) | Review PLAN₃ integration tests                                                            |
| `/security-review`                   | 1st (pos 16) | Architecture security review                                                              |
| `/security-review`                   | 2nd (pos 57) | Production readiness security review                                                      |
| `/spec [mode=tests]`                 | 1st (pos 30) | TDD-SPEC₁: Feature test specs (before implementation)                                     |
| `/spec [mode=tests]`                 | 2nd (pos 47) | TDD-SPEC₂: Post-implementation test spec update                                           |
| `/artifact-review --type=spec-tests` | 1st (pos 32) | Review TDD-SPEC₁                                                                          |
| `/artifact-review --type=spec-tests` | 2nd (pos 49) | Review TDD-SPEC₂                                                                          |
| `/test`                              | 1st (pos 55) | Test after integration tests                                                              |
| `/test`                              | 2nd (pos 59) | Final test verification                                                                   |
| `/domain-entities-review`            | 1st (pos 46) | DDD quality review — conditional: skip if no domain entity files in changeset             |
| `/linter-setup`                      | (new)        | LINTER-SETUP: Install and configure computational feedback sensors                        |
| `/harness-setup`                     | (new)        | HARNESS-SETUP: Full outer agent harness (feedforward guides + feedback sensors inventory) |

**NEVER deduplicate** — each occurrence is a distinct task with a different purpose.

**IMPORTANT MANDATORY Steps:** /idea -> /web-research -> /deep-research -> /business-evaluation -> /spec-discovery -> /domain-analysis -> /why-review -> /tech-stack-research -> /architecture-design -> /architecture-scalability-review -> /why-review -> /scenario -> /plan -> /plan-review -> /security-review -> /performance-review -> /plan-review -> /refine -> /why-review -> /artifact-review --type=pbi -> /story -> /why-review -> /artifact-review --type=story -> /pbi-challenge -> /dor-gate -> /pbi-mockup -> /plan-validate -> /why-review -> /spec [mode=tests] -> /why-review -> /artifact-review --type=spec-tests -> /spec-clarify -> /plan -> /plan-review -> /scaffold -> /linter-setup -> /harness-setup -> /architecture-review-full -> /scan --target=ui-system -> /scan --target=backend-patterns -> /scan --target=integration-tests -> /scan --target=project-structure -> /why-review -> /plan-execute -> /domain-entities-review -> /spec [mode=tests] -> /why-review -> /artifact-review --type=spec-tests -> /plan -> /plan-review -> /integration-test -> /integration-test-review -> /integration-test-verify -> /test -> /workflow-review-changes -> /security-review -> /changelog -> /test -> /scan --target=domain-entities -> /docs-update -> /workflow-end -> /watzup

**IMPORTANT MANDATORY Steps:** /idea -> /web-research -> /deep-research -> /business-evaluation -> /spec-discovery -> /domain-analysis -> /why-review -> /tech-stack-research -> /architecture-design -> /architecture-scalability-review -> /why-review -> /scenario -> /plan -> /plan-review -> /security-review -> /performance-review -> /plan-review -> /refine -> /why-review -> /artifact-review --type=pbi -> /story -> /why-review -> /artifact-review --type=story -> /pbi-challenge -> /dor-gate -> /pbi-mockup -> /plan-validate -> /why-review -> /spec [mode=tests] -> /why-review -> /artifact-review --type=spec-tests -> /spec-clarify -> /plan -> /plan-review -> /scaffold -> /linter-setup -> /harness-setup -> /architecture-review-full -> /scan --target=ui-system -> /scan --target=backend-patterns -> /scan --target=integration-tests -> /scan --target=project-structure -> /why-review -> /plan-execute -> /domain-entities-review -> /spec [mode=tests] -> /why-review -> /artifact-review --type=spec-tests -> /plan -> /plan-review -> /integration-test -> /integration-test-review -> /integration-test-verify -> /test -> /workflow-review-changes -> /security-review -> /changelog -> /test -> /scan --target=domain-entities -> /docs-update -> /workflow-end -> /watzup

> **[BLOCKING]** Each selected step MUST ATTENTION invoke its `Skill` tool — marking a selected task `completed` without skill invocation is a workflow violation. A declared conditional step such as `/scenario` may be marked skipped only with evidence and an explicit reason; NEVER batch-complete validation gates.

Activate the `workflow-greenfield-init` workflow. Run `/start-workflow workflow-greenfield-init` with the user's prompt as context.

**Steps:** /idea → /web-research → /deep-research → /business-evaluation → /spec-discovery → /domain-analysis → /why-review → /tech-stack-research → /architecture-design → /architecture-scalability-review → /why-review → /scenario → /plan → /plan-review → /security-review → /performance-review → /plan-review → /refine → /why-review → /artifact-review --type=pbi → /story → /why-review → /artifact-review --type=story → /pbi-challenge → /dor-gate → /pbi-mockup → /plan-validate → /why-review → /spec [mode=tests] → /why-review → /artifact-review --type=spec-tests → /spec-clarify → /plan → /plan-review → /scaffold → /linter-setup → /harness-setup → /architecture-review-full → /scan --target=ui-system → /scan --target=backend-patterns → /scan --target=integration-tests → /scan --target=project-structure → /why-review → /plan-execute → /domain-entities-review → /spec [mode=tests] → /why-review → /artifact-review --type=spec-tests → /plan → /plan-review → /integration-test → /integration-test-review → /integration-test-verify → /test → /workflow-review-changes → /security-review → /changelog → /test → /scan --target=domain-entities → /docs-update → /workflow-end → /watzup

> **[CONDITIONAL TERMINAL DOMAIN-ENTITY REFERENCE REFRESH]** After `/test` and before `/docs-update`, run `/scan --target=domain-entities` to refresh the project-reference entity catalog only when the final diff changes an entity/model, DTO/data contract, persistence schema/migration, or entity-sync evidence represented in `docs/project-reference/domain-entities-reference.md`. Otherwise mark the scan step completed with a cited skip reason naming the changed files and why they are outside this scope; this is the explicitly authorized exception to the per-step skill-invocation rule.

> **Architecture quality gate (`/architecture-scalability-review`, pos 10).** Immediately after `/architecture-design` and before the first `/plan`, greenfield runs the architecture & scalability scorecard (init mode) so its findings and gate items feed the implementation plan. This is the comprehensive project-quality evaluation for greenfield/init — Build & CI scalability, architecture pattern (modular monolith vs. microservices / distributed-monolith avoidance), module isolation, dependency discipline, loose coupling, horizontal scaling, DRY, abstraction/easy-to-change, clean architecture, and observability/DevOps. Brownfield or day-to-day audits invoke the same skill on demand via `/architecture-scalability-review mode=audit`; it is intentionally NOT a member of the every-change `workflow-review-changes` batch — that batch's `architecture-review` step carries the lightweight per-change scalability & coupling regression check instead.

> **Lean variant (`mode=lean`)** — for low-risk or solo greenfield inception, a trimmed path is available (formerly a separate lean greenfield wrapper, now merged here). It keeps the same backbone but drops the per-step `/why-review` rationale gates (retaining only the single pre-`/plan-execute` `/why-review`), `/pbi-challenge`, `/dor-gate`, and the `/integration-test-review` + `/integration-test-verify` gates. Use ONLY when inception risk is low; default to the full rigorous sequence above. The authoritative sequence is the `workflow-greenfield-init` entry in `workflows.json` — the lean path is a documented gate-skip option, not a separate workflow.

<!-- SYNC:ai-mistake-prevention -->

> **AI Mistake Prevention** — Failure modes to avoid on every task:
>
> **Re-read files after context changes.** Context compaction, resume, or long-running work can make memory stale; verify current files before acting.
> **Verify generated content against source evidence.** AI hallucinates APIs, names, claims, and document facts. Check the relevant source before documenting or referencing.
> **Check downstream references before deleting or renaming.** Removing an artifact can stale docs, generated mirrors, configs, and callers; map references first.
> **Trace the full impact chain after edits.** Changing a definition can miss derived outputs and consumers. Follow the affected chain before declaring done.
> **Verify ALL affected outputs, not just the first.** One green check is not all green checks; validate every output surface the change can affect.
> **Assume existing values are intentional — ask WHY before changing OR flagging one as a defect.** Before changing or reporting a constant, limit, flag, cutoff, wording, or pattern, read nearby context and history, the CALLER's ordering, and 2+ sibling call sites of the same convention. A doc stating WHAT without WHY is missing rationale, not proof of a missing guard.
> **Surface ambiguity before acting — don't pick silently.** Multiple valid interpretations require an explicit question or stated assumption with risk.
> **Assert the outcome your system owns, not the intermediate state your infrastructure owns.** When verifying async work, assert the final business state — never the delivery/retry bookkeeping held in shared infrastructure that any co-running process can write. Such a check passes when run alone and flakes the moment anything else shares that infrastructure.
> **Keep shared guidance role-relevant.** Universal guidance must help every receiving skill or agent; code-specific obligations belong only in code-specific protocols.

<!-- SYNC:nested-task-creation -->

> **Nested Task Expansion Contract** — For workflow-step invocation, the `[Workflow] ...` row is only a parent container; the child skill still creates visible phase tasks.
>
> 1. Call `TaskList` first. If a matching active parent workflow row exists, set `nested=true` and record `parentTaskId`; otherwise run standalone.
> 2. Create one task per declared phase before phase work. When nested, prefix subjects `[N.M] $skill-name — phase`.
> 3. When nested, link the parent with `TaskUpdate(parentTaskId, addBlockedBy: [childIds])`.
> 4. Orchestrators must pre-expand a child skill's phase list and link the workflow row before invoking that child skill or sub-agent.
> 5. Mark exactly one child `in_progress` before work and `completed` immediately after evidence is written.
> 6. Complete the parent only after all child tasks are completed or explicitly cancelled with reason.
>
> **Blocked until:** `TaskList` done, child phases created, parent linked when nested, first child marked `in_progress`.

> **Context budget** — the return payload is a SUMMARY, not a transcript: ≤10 finding bullets, no raw file contents / full diffs / verbatim logs inline, no re-pasted source. Everything beyond the summary lives in the `Full report` on disk. A sub-agent that would exceed the summary shape MUST write the detail to its report and return only the pointer — the orchestrator's context is the scarce resource the whole map-reduce protects.

<!-- SYNC:critical-thinking-mindset:reminder -->

**MUST ATTENTION** apply critical + sequential thinking — every claim needs appropriate traced evidence (`file:line` for repo/code claims; source URL or artifact section for research, product, content, and docs claims); confidence >80% to act, <60% DO NOT recommend.

<!-- /SYNC:critical-thinking-mindset:reminder -->

<!-- SYNC:ai-mistake-prevention:reminder -->

**MUST ATTENTION** apply AI mistake prevention — verify generated content against evidence, trace downstream references before deleting or renaming, verify all affected outputs, re-read files after context loss, and surface ambiguity before acting.

<!-- /SYNC:ai-mistake-prevention:reminder -->

<!-- SYNC:nested-task-creation:reminder -->

- **MANDATORY** Parent workflow rows do not replace child phase tracking; expand phases and link the parent when nested.
- **MANDATORY** Orchestrators pre-expand child skill phases before invocation; use `[N.M] $skill-name — phase` prefixes and one-`in_progress` discipline.

<!-- SYNC:project-protocol-overlay -->

> **Project Protocol Overlay** — Before executing this skill, resolve any PROJECT overlay rules layered onto it: match this skill's name against the `Target` column of the project's skill-protocol index (`docs/project-reference/skill-protocols-reference.md` by default; a `referenceDocs` entry in `docs/project-config.json` overrides the path), taking the most specific matching tier ONLY — exact name > glob > `*`. **That precedence orders overlays against EACH OTHER, never against this skill.** Read ONLY the matched bodies, resolved as `<protocols-dir>/<Name>.md`; a row's Body link is display text, never a read path. A matched body that is missing or malformed is REPORTED and skipped — never reconstructed from the index Description. No index, or no match -> proceed with no overlay, silently. Full contract: `.claude/skills/project-skill-protocol/references/registry.md`.
>
> Overlays are **ADDITIVE ONLY**: they ADD rules on top of this skill's own protocol and NEVER replace, override, disable, or reinterpret a rule it already states — removing every overlay must return this skill to exactly its documented behavior. An overlay is a BRIEF, not an authority escalation: it can NEVER waive a workflow gate, git discipline, a review gate, or a user-confirmation gate. A genuine overlay-vs-skill conflict, or two equally-specific overlays that directly contradict -> surface both to the user; NEVER resolve silently.

<!-- /SYNC:project-protocol-overlay -->

<!-- SYNC:project-protocol-overlay:reminder -->

**MUST ATTENTION** resolve project protocol overlays for this skill BEFORE executing — most specific matching tier only (exact > glob > `*`, which ranks overlays against each other, NEVER against this skill), read only matched bodies at `<protocols-dir>/<Name>.md`; a missing or malformed body is reported, never reconstructed. Overlays are ADDITIVE ONLY (they never replace this skill's own rules) and are a brief, NEVER an authority escalation; an equal-specificity contradiction goes to the user.

## Closing Reminders

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION Goal:** Complete greenfield inception from an owner-approved capability boundary—using embedded large-idea decomposition when triggered, or an explicit roadmap only when requested—through a releasable first vertical outcome, reviewed enabling foundation, implementation, tests, full-flow UI evidence when applicable, and handoff without skipping gates.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION Main steps:** classify/decompose → research → domain/tech/architecture → scenario/plan/review → PBI/story/mock-up/spec gates → scaffold/lint/harness/architecture review → implementation/integration verification → final review/security/test/docs/handoff.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** apply `.claude/skills/shared/releasable-pbi-contract.md`: no standalone technical/foundation/setup PBI; UI PBIs must include all required pages/views, navigation, components, states, and a connected mock-app demo.

**Protocols in force (concise digest of the SYNC/shared blocks this skill carries):**

- **AI Mistake Prevention:** verify generated content against evidence, trace downstream references, verify all affected outputs, re-read after context loss, surface ambiguity.
- **Nested Task Creation:** expand child phases, link parent when nested, one task `in_progress`.
- **Critical Thinking:** traced `file:line` proof per claim, confidence >80% to act.
- **Incremental Persistence:** append findings to `plans/reports/` per file, never hold in memory.
- **Sub-Agent Return Contract:** return summary only (≤10 bullets), full detail to disk.

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** break work into small todo tasks using `TaskCreate` BEFORE starting
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** search codebase for 3+ similar patterns before creating new code
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** cite `file:line` evidence for every claim (confidence >80% to act)
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** add a final review todo task to verify work quality

**[TASK-PLANNING]** Before acting, analyze task scope and systematically break it into small todo tasks and sub-tasks using TaskCreate.

> **[IMPORTANT]** Analyze how big the task is and break it into many small todo tasks systematically before starting — this is very important.
