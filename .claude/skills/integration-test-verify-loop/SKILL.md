## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Drive an integration-test suite to **fully green** by pairing `/integration-test-verify` with a combined fault-adjudication + `/fix` half in a recursive loop — each round runs a FRESH full `/integration-test-verify` over `{scope}` (**the WHOLE system by default**, or the target named in the prompt), and on ANY failure runs `/debug-investigate` **and** `/integration-test-review` (report-only) together to decide _who is at fault_, then `/fix` at the owning layer — stopping only when a fresh full verify passes its **2-consecutive-green-runs-without-DB-reset** gate with **zero failed tests**, proven by actual runner output.

**Summary:**

- **Each round = verify (find) + adjudicate (diagnose) + `/fix` (resolve) + `/changes-review` (prove the fix is sound).** `/integration-test-verify` reports pass/fail but must not own the fix; the adjudication pair decides _test-wrong vs test-not-optimal vs source-wrong_; `/fix` lands the change; `/changes-review` code-reviews that change before the next round. A round is incomplete until all four have run (or the verify returned zero failures).
- **Steps (in order):** (0) resolve `{scope}` + Goal Contract → (0b) bind the convergence loop (protocol loop primary + optional `/goal` accelerator) → (1) round loop { snapshot → run `/integration-test-verify` INLINE over `{scope}` → **on failure:** `/debug-investigate` + `/integration-test-review` report-only → emit ONE Fault Verdict per failure → `/fix` at the owning layer → **CONDITIONAL `/changes-review` on the round's fix diff when any fix landed** → Round Integrity Check → log iteration } → (2) converge on a zero-failure fresh verify OR escalate → (3) terminal spec/doc sync + recap.
- **Every fix gets code-reviewed in the round that lands it.** Whenever a round applies ANY fix — source, test, scenario, or spec — that round runs `/changes-review` (report-only, INLINE) over the round's fix diff; validated findings fold back into the SAME round's fix set. No fix applied → skipped with a recorded reason. — why: a green test cannot see a wrong-layer fix, a broken invariant elsewhere, or a security/performance regression.
- **Default scope is the WHOLE SYSTEM.** With no target in the prompt, `{scope}` = **every** discovered integration-test project (`testProjectPattern` glob > `testProjects` list) — NOT the git-changed subset. The loop passes `{scope}` to `/integration-test-verify` **explicitly** so it never falls through to its change-scoped default (`integration-test-verify/SKILL.md:132,159`).
- **Convergence:** stop ONLY when a **fresh full** `/integration-test-verify` over the CURRENT (post-fix) code reports **zero failed tests across 2 consecutive runs without a DB reset**, with real runner output — never a stale green predating the last fix.
- **Inline invariant:** run `/integration-test-verify`, `/debug-investigate`, and `/integration-test-review` via the `Skill` tool, NEVER the `Agent` tool. `/debug-investigate` requires its `/why-review` gate **in the same session/main agent** (`debug-investigate/SKILL.md:34`), and `/integration-test-review` self-binds its own fix + re-review obligations — a sub-agent cannot own or carry either back to this loop. Their OWN internal fan-outs (verify's `integration-tester` per-project sub-agents, `integration-test-review`'s phase agents) stay sub-agents by their own design, so context stays bounded.
- **No fake green — Round Integrity Check:** a round converges only if the executed test count did **not shrink** and the skipped count did **not grow** versus the prior round. Deleting, skipping, or narrowing tests is a REGRESSION, never convergence.
- **Bounded:** round cap default 3; failing count not shrinking across 2 rounds, or cap hit with failures still open → **STOP & escalate** via `AskUserQuestion`. Increasing failures → STOP (fixes regressing). Environment/infrastructure fault → **BLOCKED**, escalate immediately — never loop against an unhealthy system.

**Why this skill exists (READ FIRST — it is the whole justification):** the obligation to loop already exists as **prose scattered across three skills**, with no mechanism behind it. `/integration-test-verify` says _"After fixing → re-run the full 2-run verify sequence"_ (`integration-test-verify/SKILL.md:238`) and its `SYNC:integration-test-execution-discipline` §5 says _"Loop until the whole suite is green"_ (`:404`) — but there is **no round cap, no Goal Contract, no shrinking-failures gate, and no escalation path**, so an agent that fixes one test and reports success is not violating anything mechanical. Worse, the fix half is **triple-owned and undefined**: `/integration-test-review` fixes tests and re-reviews itself (P5–P8), `/fix --target=test` runs its own unbounded _"if tests fail, repeat from step 2"_ (`fix/SKILL.md:218`), and verify's own failure protocol says fix-and-re-run (`:232-238`) — three overlapping loops that can double-fix the same failure or each assume another owns it. This skill makes the loop a **bounded, evidence-gated convergence contract with one owner**: verify FINDS, the `/debug-investigate` + `/integration-test-review` pair ADJUDICATES fault, `/fix` RESOLVES, and a fresh full verify RE-PROVES — with a Round Integrity Check so the suite can never go "green" by losing tests. Without it, "tests failed, then something fixed them" ships on a single green run over a hand-picked subset.

**Workflow:** resolve `{scope}` (whole system by default) + Goal Contract → bind the convergence loop → **round loop** { run `/integration-test-verify` INLINE → on failure run `/debug-investigate` + `/integration-test-review` report-only → emit Fault Verdict → `/fix` at owning layer → conditional `/changes-review` on the round's fix diff → Round Integrity Check → log iteration } → converge when a fresh full verify is 2/2 green with zero failures → terminal `/spec [mode=sync]` + `/docs-update` + recap.

**Key Rules:**

- **Each round pairs verify (find) + adjudicate (diagnose) + `/fix` (resolve) + `/changes-review` (review the fix).** Never skip the adjudication half and jump straight to a fix — an unadjudicated failure gets "fixed" by whatever is nearest, which is almost always the assertion.
- **CONDITIONAL `/changes-review` every round that lands a fix.** Working tree changed vs the round's snapshot → run `/changes-review` INLINE, report-only, scoped to the round's fix diff; validate its findings and fold them into the SAME round's fix set; unfixable validated findings → STOP & escalate. Working tree unchanged → skip with a recorded reason. NEVER let a round's fixes reach the next round un-reviewed.
- **Default `{scope}` = the WHOLE system**; a target named in the prompt narrows it. Pass `{scope}` to `/integration-test-verify` EXPLICITLY every round — never let it fall back to git auto-detect.
- **MUST run INLINE via the `Skill` tool — NEVER dispatch `/integration-test-verify`, `/debug-investigate`, `/integration-test-review`, or `/changes-review` as a sub-agent** (their in-session gates are lost). Their internal fan-outs remain sub-agents by their own design.
- **`/integration-test-review` runs REPORT-ONLY.** It performs its 8-gate review and STOPS before its P5 fix / P6 re-review / P7 build-and-run — the loop owns fixing and re-running. If it cannot be constrained and self-fixes anyway, treat that as this round's fix half and skip the `/fix` step for that round — never double-fix.
- **One written Fault Verdict per failure BEFORE any edit** — `TEST-WRONG` · `TEST-NOT-OPTIMAL` · `SOURCE-WRONG` · `ENVIRONMENT-BLOCKED` · `AMBIGUOUS` — with `file:line` evidence and confidence. `AMBIGUOUS` → `AskUserQuestion`, never a silent pick.
- **NEVER force green.** No weakened or removed assertions, no skip annotations, no widened assertion timeouts, no retries around a failing assertion, no repository-hacked domain data, no narrowed scope. Fix the SCENARIO (an ARRANGE barrier on a real observable) or the product defect.
- **Convergence = a fresh full verify over the post-fix code, 2/2 green, zero failures, real runner output, Round Integrity Check passed.** All five, or it is not converged.
- **Round cap (default 3)**; failures not shrinking across 2 rounds, increasing, or cap hit with failures open → **STOP & escalate** via `AskUserQuestion`. `ENVIRONMENT-BLOCKED` → escalate immediately; never loop against an unhealthy system.

## First Principle — Convergence, Not Motion

> A round that changes the code is progress **only if** the next fresh verify has fewer failing tests.
> The loop exists to reach a fixed point (a whole suite that is green twice in a row), not to keep editing until something passes.
> If the failing count stops shrinking, that is a signal to **escalate**, not to spin another round.
> And a suite that got greener by having fewer tests did not converge — it regressed.

---

## Step 0 — Resolve Verification Scope + Goal Contract (FIRST ACTION)

1. **Read `docs/project-config.json` → `integrationTestVerify`** before anything else (the same config `/integration-test-verify` obeys, `integration-test-verify/SKILL.md:74-92`). You need `quickRunCommand`, `testProjectPattern`, `testProjects`, `systemCheckCommand`, `startupScript`, and `referenceDocs` to resolve scope and to read the project's integration-test reference docs.
2. **Resolve `{scope}` — WHOLE SYSTEM by default:**

   | Prompt                               | `{scope}`                                                                                                                                    |
   | ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | **No target named** (default)        | **Every** integration-test project discoverable via `testProjectPattern` glob > `testProjects` list. The WHOLE system.                       |
   | Names a suite/project/module/feature | Only the test projects covering that target, resolved from the same config; state which projects the target maps to and how you resolved it. |
   | Names a diff/branch/PR               | The test projects covering that change set — this is the ONLY case where change-scoping is correct, and it must be explicit in the prompt.   |

   > **NEVER let `/integration-test-verify` resolve scope by itself.** Its Step 3 priority ends in git auto-detect and _"Only run projects relevant to the current change"_ (`integration-test-verify/SKILL.md:132,159`) — correct when it is a workflow step after an edit, WRONG as this loop's default. Pass `{scope}` explicitly in the invocation every round. — why: a loop that silently verifies only the changed subset reports "all green" for a system it never ran.

3. **Record `{scope}` as a stable string** (the resolved project list). The scope is FIXED for the whole loop — it never narrows as rounds progress. If a fix legitimately ADDS a test project, widen `{scope}` and say so in the Iteration Log; narrowing it is forbidden.
4. **Resolve/create the Goal Contract** per `SYNC:goal-contract-satisfaction-loop` (`plans/goals/{YYMMDD-HHmm}-{slug}/goal.md`, template `.claude/templates/goal-contract-template.md`). Its single **required** Success Criterion:

   > _A fresh full `/integration-test-verify` over `{scope}` reports **zero failed tests** across **2 consecutive runs without a DB reset**, evidenced by actual test-runner output (Passed/Failed/Skipped counts), with no test deleted, skipped, or weakened to get there._

   Record in **Constraints**: `{scope}` (the project list), the round cap (default 3), the baseline executed/skipped test counts once round 1 reports them, and `quickRunCommand`.

## Step 0b — Bind the Convergence Loop (protocol-first; `/goal` is an optional accelerator)

The convergence loop is bound by TWO layers. The **protocol loop (Steps 1–2) is the BINDING mechanism** and MUST be self-driven by you, the running agent, on every host — with or without any command or hook. The **`/goal` command is an OPTIONAL accelerator** layered on top; it is never the primary mechanism, and its absence NEVER weakens the loop. This mirrors the project rule that hooks/trackers are accelerators only — correctness must not depend on them.

**1. Protocol loop — ALWAYS binding (hook/command-independent).** You are personally responsible for not stopping until the loop converges or bounded-escalates. This binds Claude, Codex, and Copilot equally, whether or not `/goal` exists:

> Repeatedly run `/integration-test-verify` INLINE over `{scope}` (passed explicitly, never re-derived). After each run, if ANY test failed, adjudicate every failure with `/debug-investigate` + `/integration-test-review` (report-only) into ONE Fault Verdict, apply the fix via `/fix` at the owning layer, then re-run a FRESH full `/integration-test-verify` over `{scope}`. Do NOT stop while the last verify still reported a failing test. Converge ONLY when a fresh full verify reports zero failures across 2 consecutive runs without a DB reset AND the Round Integrity Check passes (executed test count not shrunk, skipped count not grown). Cap at `{N=5}` rounds; if the failing count does not shrink across 2 consecutive rounds, failures increase, the cap is hit with failures still open, or any failure is ENVIRONMENT-BLOCKED → STOP and escalate via `AskUserQuestion`. Never loop open-ended, and NEVER reach green by weakening, skipping, deleting, or de-scoping a test.

Treat this as a standing obligation you re-read at every Step 2 checkpoint — NOT a one-time note you can rationalize away after the first fix cycle. The Goal Contract's required Success Criterion (Step 0) is its durable, host-independent record.

**2. `/goal` command — invoke as an accelerator WHEN AVAILABLE.** If a `/goal` command exists and you are permitted to run it in this environment, ALSO invoke it (a real tool/command call, NOT a paraphrase, NOT a Goal Contract file substituted for it) with the SAME condition, so a session Stop hook mechanically enforces the loop:

```
/goal integration-test green convergence loop: repeatedly run /integration-test-verify INLINE over {scope} (passed explicitly). If any test failed → adjudicate each failure with /debug-investigate + /integration-test-review (report-only) into one Fault Verdict, fix via /fix at the owning layer, and run another round. If a fresh full verify reports zero failures across 2 consecutive runs without DB reset AND executed test count has not shrunk and skipped count has not grown → CONVERGED, run the terminal /spec [mode=sync] + /docs-update and clear the gate. Do NOT stop while the last verify still reported a failing test. Cap at {N=5} rounds; if the failing count does not shrink across 2 consecutive rounds, failures increase, the cap is hit with failures open, or a failure is ENVIRONMENT-BLOCKED → STOP and escalate via AskUserQuestion. Never loop open-ended; never reach green by weakening, skipping, deleting, or de-scoping a test.
```

The `/goal` Stop hook blocks stopping until the condition holds and auto-clears when met — do not tell the user to clear it.

**If `/goal` is unavailable, unregistered, or not permitted** (e.g. Codex/Copilot, or a Claude run without the command): DO NOT error, DO NOT block, and DO NOT invent a stand-in gate. Record ONE line in the Goal Contract — `/goal accelerator unavailable — loop bound by protocol (Steps 1–2) + this Goal Contract` — and proceed. The protocol loop above plus the Goal Contract are the same gate, enforced by discipline instead of a hook.

> **Nested gates (by design, safe):** each inner `/debug-investigate` self-binds its own `/why-review` validation gate that clears when its root cause is validated, and `/integration-test-review` runs REPORT-ONLY so its P5 fix / P6 re-review loop is deferred to this caller — no inner fix gate is installed. THIS outer loop owns the single convergence gate. All self-clear on satisfaction — no orphaned gate. Do NOT tell the user to clear any of them.

## Step 1 — Round Loop (verify → adjudicate → fix → review → integrity-check → log)

Each round couples four halves — **verify to find, adjudicate to diagnose, fix to resolve, `/changes-review` to prove the fix itself is sound.** For each round `R` (starting at 1), do ALL of:

1. **Snapshot before:** record the working-tree fingerprint — `git status --porcelain` + `git diff --stat`. This is the fixes-applied baseline for the round and the objective backstop for convergence detection (Step 2).
2. **Run `/integration-test-verify` INLINE** via the `Skill` tool (NEVER the `Agent` tool), passing `{scope}` **explicitly** so it skips its own scope derivation. It runs its full contract: system check → the named projects → the **2-consecutive-green-runs-without-DB-reset** gate → a report with real Passed/Failed/Skipped counts and failing test names. Let it fan out its own `integration-tester` sub-agents per isolated project (its design, `integration-test-verify/SKILL.md:188-206`) — that fan-out is bounded and correct. **Tell it explicitly that this run IS a round of this loop**, so it returns its counts + failing names to this loop instead of recommending `/workflow-integration-test-green` as a next step — why: that recommendation is correct for a standalone verify but circular here, and would restart the loop that is already running.
3. **Record the round's counts:** executed, passed, failed, skipped — per project and total, from **actual runner output**. These feed the Round Integrity Check (1.8) and the shrinking-failures gate (Step 2). No output = no counts = no claim.
4. **If failures = 0** and the 2-run gate was green → this round converged; go to Step 2 (no adjudication or fix half needed).
5. **If failures > 0 — ADJUDICATE (the combined half). Run BOTH, INLINE, in this order, per failure or per failure cluster:**

   **(a) `/debug-investigate`** — trace the failure end-to-start to the defect's owning layer, producing a `file:line` root cause with a confidence score, validated through its own `/why-review` gate. It is investigation-ONLY — it never patches (`debug-investigate/SKILL.md:22`).

   **(b) `/integration-test-review` — REPORT-ONLY** — scoped to the failing tests **and the production code they exercise**. Its 8 gates supply the test-side verdict: G1 assertion value (mutation probe), G2 data state, G3 repeatability, G4 domain logic (does the test assert only what the handler writes?), G5 spec traceability, G6 three-way sync, G7 change coverage, G8 scenario fidelity. **Direct it to STOP after its findings report** — no P5 fix, no P6 re-review, no P7 build-and-run; this loop owns fixing and re-running.

   **Combine (a) + (b) into ONE written Fault Verdict per failure, BEFORE any edit:**

   | Verdict                 | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Evidence required                                                                                                                                          | Resolution                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

   **Intermittent failures (red in one run of the 2-run gate, green in the other) use the three-way flake adjudication instead** — (a) unrealistic scenario / compressed pacing, (b) harness topology amplification, (c) genuine product race — per `integration-test-verify/SKILL.md:298-316`. Record the verdict with evidence BEFORE any change; do NOT file (c) until (a) and (b) are ruled out.

6. **Run `/fix` on the adjudicated verdicts** (failures > 0 only) — this is the half the loop owns. Resolve each at its owning layer, routed by verdict: `SOURCE-WRONG` → `/fix` (its `--target` routing) or a direct edit at the lowest invariant-owning layer, then `/prove-fix`; `TEST-WRONG` / `TEST-NOT-OPTIMAL` → repair the test or scenario at its root; a missing §8 TC surfaced by G5/G7 → `/spec [mode=tests]`; a spec divergence → adjudicate per `SYNC:spec-drift-adjudication` (`/spec [update]` for SPEC-STALE, a BLOCKING fix for CODE-WRONG). Fix ONLY adjudicated verdicts — never an unadjudicated guess.

   > **If `/integration-test-review` could not be constrained to report-only and already applied its P5 fixes**, treat those as this round's fix half (detect fixes-applied against the 1.1 snapshot) and SKIP this step for that round — never double-fix the same failure.

7. **CONDITIONAL — run `/changes-review` on the round's fix diff, when (and only when) the round applied ANY fix.** Compare the working tree against the 1.1 snapshot: unchanged → SKIP this sub-step and record `No fix applied this round — /changes-review skipped`. Changed → run it, every round, on every round's fixes.

   - **Scope = the round's fix diff**, not the whole branch: exactly the files this round changed since the 1.1 snapshot (source fixes, test fixes, scenario repairs, spec/TC edits alike). — why: the round's own changes are the only thing the prior rounds' reviews have not already seen.
   - **Run it INLINE via the `Skill` tool, REPORT-ONLY** — its full dimensional review, then STOP before its Phase 7 self-fix / Phase 7.5 holistic / Phase 8 docs-update (the documented `$workflow-review-changes` boundary where the caller owns fixing, `changes-review/SKILL.md:52,204`). NEVER dispatch it as a sub-agent — it self-binds its own review-loop obligations, which a sub-agent cannot own or carry back (`changes-review-loop/SKILL.md:37`). Its own Phase 0.7 dimensional reviewers stay sub-agents by its design.
   - **Validate, then fold the surviving findings into THIS round's fix set** — run `/why-review --validate-findings` over its report and apply every VALIDATED finding at its owning layer, exactly as in 1.6. The next round's fresh full verify is what re-proves them, so the test loop stays the single convergence engine — do NOT open a nested review→fix loop here.
   - **Unfixable validated findings → STOP & escalate** via `AskUserQuestion` (Step 2). A round that leaves a validated review finding open has not finished, even if its tests went green.
   - **This subsumes the `SOURCE-WRONG` per-verdict routing** in 1.5: that verdict already demands the changed source reach `/changes-review` before PASS (`integration-test-verify/SKILL.md:294`). Running it once per round over the whole fix diff satisfies that obligation AND extends it to test-side and spec-side fixes — do not run it twice for the same diff.

   — why: the loop's own convergence signal is "the tests went green", and a fix that greens a test can still be wrong in every way a test cannot see — wrong layer, broken invariant elsewhere, dead code, a leaked domain concept, a security or performance regression. Without a per-round review, every fix this loop lands ships un-code-reviewed on the strength of a green suite alone.

8. **Round Integrity Check (no fake green) — BLOCKING before the round can count as progress.** Compare this round's counts (1.3) against the prior round's:

   | Signal                                     | Meaning                                                                           | Action                                                                                       |
   | ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | Executed test count **decreased**          | Tests were deleted, renamed out of discovery, filtered out, or the scope narrowed | **REGRESSION → STOP & escalate.** Restore the tests. A smaller suite is not a greener suite. |
   | Skipped count **increased**                | A failure was hidden behind a skip annotation                                     | **REGRESSION → STOP & escalate.** Remove the skip and adjudicate the failure properly.       |
   | `{scope}` project list **shrank**          | The loop de-scoped its way to green                                               | **REGRESSION → STOP & escalate.** `{scope}` is fixed (Step 0.3).                             |
   | Counts stable or grown, failures shrinking | Genuine progress                                                                  | Continue to Step 2.                                                                          |

   — why: unlike a review loop, a test loop has a cheap fake exit — remove what fails. This check is the only thing standing between "converged" and "quietly deleted the hard tests".

9. **Append an Iteration Log entry** to the Goal Contract: round number, per-project executed/passed/failed/skipped counts, the failing test names, each Fault Verdict with its `file:line` evidence and confidence, the fixes applied (`file:line`), the `/changes-review` verdict for the round's fix diff (or the explicit skip reason when no fix landed), the Round Integrity Check result, and remaining gaps.

## Step 2 — Convergence & Escalation Gate

Evaluate after every round:

| Condition                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Action                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Fresh full `/integration-test-verify` over `{scope}` reported **zero failures across 2 consecutive runs without a DB reset**, AND the Round Integrity Check passed, AND the working tree is unchanged by that final verify pass | **CONVERGED** → mark the required criterion PASS in the Goal Satisfaction matrix (attaching the runner output) → clear the `/goal` gate → go to Step 3.      |
| Failures > 0 AND round `< N` AND the failing count shrank vs the prior round AND integrity held                                                                                                                                 | Apply the adjudicated fixes (Step 1.6), then run round `R+1` (fresh full re-verify over the SAME `{scope}`).                                                 |
| Failing count did **not shrink** across 2 consecutive rounds (same/increasing count)                                                                                                                                            | **STOP & escalate** via `AskUserQuestion` — a non-converging loop is a signal, not a reason to spin.                                                         |
| Round cap `N` hit with failures still open                                                                                                                                                                                      | **STOP & escalate** via `AskUserQuestion` — report the still-failing tests with their Fault Verdicts; do not silently continue.                              |
| Any failure adjudicated **ENVIRONMENT-BLOCKED**                                                                                                                                                                                 | **STOP & escalate immediately** — mark the criterion BLOCKED with a user-facing reason and point at `startupScript`. Never loop against an unhealthy system. |
| Any failure adjudicated **AMBIGUOUS**                                                                                                                                                                                           | **PAUSE and `AskUserQuestion`** before the fix — resume the loop with the user's answer.                                                                     |
| Round Integrity Check failed (tests lost, skips added, scope narrowed)                                                                                                                                                          | **STOP & escalate** — restore the lost coverage first; this is a regression, not progress.                                                                   |
| The round's `/changes-review` (1.7) left **validated findings unfixed**                                                                                                                                                         | **STOP & escalate** via `AskUserQuestion` — a green suite does not clear an open, validated review finding on the fix that greened it.                       |

> **Increasing failures = STOP.** If round `R` has MORE failing tests than round `R-1`, the fixes are regressing the system — STOP and escalate immediately. Never trade one green test for two new red ones across rounds.

## Step 3 — Terminal Spec/Doc Sync + Recap

1. **Terminal sync (MANDATORY once converged, when running STANDALONE).** The loop deferred all downstream sync while it churned, so close it now, in order:
   - **`/spec [mode=sync]`** — reconcile §8 TCs ↔ the executing test code; update every `CoveredBy` field for tests the loop changed or added.
   - **`/docs-update`** — update impacted docs: the integration-test reference doc, feature-doc evidence fields, and version history if coverage changed materially.

   > **When this skill runs as a step inside a workflow that already declares `/spec [mode=sync]`, `/scan --target=integration-tests`, and `/docs-update`** (e.g. `workflow-integration-test-green`), SKIP this sub-step and let the workflow own it — say so explicitly in the recap. — why: running the same sync twice churns the same files and hides which pass actually made the change.

2. **Recap.** Emit a concise convergence recap: rounds run, the shrinking failing-count sequence, each round's Fault Verdicts and the fixes applied, the final zero-failure runner output (both runs), the Round Integrity Check trail (executed/skipped counts per round), and the Goal Satisfaction matrix (required criterion PASS). Point to each round's report under `plans/reports/` and the Goal Contract Iteration Log. Do NOT commit or push unless the user explicitly asks.

## Convergence Detection — Why Five Conditions

A round converges ONLY when **all five** hold. Each closes a distinct way a test loop lies to itself:

1. **Fresh verify over the post-fix code** — a green report from a run that predates the last fix proves nothing about that fix. Every applied fix invalidates the prior verdict; re-run, never reuse.
2. **Zero failed tests** — not "only known failures left", not "the important ones pass". A single red test is an unconverged loop.
3. **2 consecutive green runs without a DB reset** — the gate `/integration-test-verify` already owns (`integration-test-verify/SKILL.md:44,169`). One green run hides order-dependent and state-leak flakiness, which is exactly what a fix cycle tends to introduce.
4. **Real runner output** — Passed/Failed/Skipped counts and names. "Looks like it passed" is theater (`integration-test-verify/SKILL.md:339`).
5. **Round Integrity Check passed** — the executed count did not shrink, the skipped count did not grow, `{scope}` did not narrow. This is the condition the other four cannot see: a suite can satisfy 1–4 perfectly by having quietly lost the tests that failed.

**Working-tree-unchanged backstop:** the converging verify pass must land no fix. A "clean" verdict that still mutated files means the round DID fix things → run another round to re-prove clean.

When failures remain but cannot be fixed (product decision, unclear intent, environment) → **escalate**, do not loop. Convergence is a fixed point, not a single green read.

---

**IMPORTANT MANDATORY sequence:** Step 0 (resolve `{scope}` — WHOLE SYSTEM by default — + Goal Contract) → Step 0b (bind the convergence loop: protocol loop primary + optional `/goal` accelerator) → Step 1 (round loop: `/integration-test-verify` INLINE → on failure `/debug-investigate` + `/integration-test-review` report-only → ONE Fault Verdict per failure → `/fix` at the owning layer → CONDITIONAL `/changes-review` on the round's fix diff when any fix landed → Round Integrity Check → log) → Step 2 (converge on a zero-failure 2/2-green fresh verify / escalate on non-progress, blocked environment, or lost coverage) → Step 3 (terminal `/spec [mode=sync]` + `/docs-update` when standalone + recap).

<!-- SYNC:goal-contract-satisfaction-loop -->

> **Goal Contract Satisfaction Loop** — Persist the user goal in an external file, execute against it, and loop review/fix until every saved required criterion passes or a blocker escalates. Bounded closed loop — NEVER open-ended autonomous exploration.
>
> 1. **Resolve the active goal** (in order): active plan `goal.md` → `plans/goals/{YYMMDD-HHmm}-{slug}/goal.md` → create a new Goal Contract from the current user request (template: `.claude/templates/goal-contract-template.md`).
> 2. **Required sections:** Original Request, Purpose, Success Criteria (checkboxes; mark required vs optional), Constraints, Evidence Required, Iteration Log, Goal Satisfaction matrix.
> 3. **Before work:** read the active goal and map planned work to saved success criteria — execution serves the saved criteria, never chat memory alone.
> 4. **After execution/verification:** append an Iteration Log entry — result, evidence references (`file:line`, command output, report path), remaining gaps.
> 5. **Review gate:** emit a Goal Satisfaction matrix — `| Success Criterion | Evidence | Status |` with PASS/FAIL/BLOCKED. Overall PASS requires every required criterion PASS.
> 6. **Loop rule (retry):** required criterion FAIL → validate the gap is real → fix → re-review only the affected criteria. Stop cleanly when all required criteria PASS.
> 7. **Escalation rule (stop):** two consecutive iterations with no criterion progressing, or a blocker needing user input → mark the criterion BLOCKED with a user-facing reason and escalate. NEVER loop indefinitely.
> 8. **Skip rule:** tiny conversational tasks may skip the goal file ONLY with a recorded one-line reason. User-accepted gate skips are recorded in the goal file with reason and scope.
> 9. **Security:** NEVER store secrets, tokens, credentials, or private customer data in goal files — store evidence references and redact sensitive values.
>
> **Blocked until:** active goal resolved (or skip reason recorded) · saved success criteria read before edits · iteration evidence appended after execution · Goal Satisfaction matrix emitted before any PASS verdict.

<!-- SYNC:test-failure-fault-adjudication -->

> **Test-Failure Fault Adjudication** — When a test fails (or you are debugging or fixing a failure), the job is to determine *who is at fault — the source code or the test code*. Getting that verdict right matters more than turning the suite green. Binds every debug / fix / test skill identically.
>
> 1. **Provisional verdict before touching either side.** Classify the observed evidence as SOURCE-WRONG, TEST-WRONG, TEST-NOT-OPTIMAL, ENVIRONMENT-BLOCKED, or AMBIGUOUS; then `/debug-investigate` and trace end-to-start before editing. A green-again suite is NOT the goal.
> 2. **Triangulate against the spec AND the source.** If a governing Feature Spec covers the behavior (e.g. `docs/specs/**` — §3 ACs / §4 BRs / §5 invariants / §8 TCs), it is the tiebreaker for *intended* behavior — compare BOTH the production source and the failing test against it. With no spec, the documented intent / acceptance criteria / caller contract is the reference. Decide from this evidence whether the SOURCE is wrong or the TEST is wrong.
> 3. **Classify who is at fault, then fix the wrong side at its root:**
>     - **SOURCE-WRONG** — production code violates the spec's intended behavior or a clear invariant → fix the source at the owning layer; keep or strengthen the test that caught it.
>     - **TEST-WRONG** — the test encodes a stale or incorrect assertion, setup, or expectation that contradicts intended behavior → fix the test at its root. NEVER weaken an assertion, add a skip, or relax a timeout to force green.
>     - **TEST-NOT-OPTIMAL** — intended behavior is valid but the test seam, timing, or assertion signal is fragile → improve the test without weakening the invariant.
>     - **ENVIRONMENT-BLOCKED** — infrastructure or external state prevents a source/test verdict → preserve diagnostics and stop mutation until the environment is healthy.
>     - **AMBIGUOUS** — evidence or intended behavior does not safely select an owner → ask the user or canonical owner before editing.
>     - NEVER change a test to match broken source, and NEVER change source to satisfy a broken test. (Migration code excluded — schema/data migrations are one-time execution paths, not core application logic.)
> 4. **Ask the user when intended behavior is unclear.** If no spec covers the behavior, the spec is silent, or the spec is ambiguous about which side is correct, STOP and `AskUserQuestion` (or consult the canonical spec owner) before editing either side — never silently pick source or test just to make the suite pass.

> **Integration Test Execution Discipline** — How the integration-test family (write · review · verify) runs, diagnoses, and clears a suite. Binds `/integration-test`, `/integration-test-review`, and `/integration-test-verify` identically.
>
> 1. **Verify the WHOLE system passes — not a hand-picked subset.** `/integration-test-verify` must prove the full relevant suite is green (every test in the system the change can touch), not one cherry-picked test. "All pass" is only true with actual runner output (Passed/Failed/Skipped counts + names) and only after 2 consecutive green runs without a DB reset.
> 2. **Drive state through real use-case paths — NEVER hack seed data.** Set up every precondition exactly as a real user would: real commands, queries, production consumers/messages, or valid idempotent seeders. NEVER create or mutate domain data by direct repository writes — that fabricates states a user could never reach and hides the real workflow bug. Hacking seed data to force a green run is forbidden.
> 3. **On ANY failure → `/debug-investigate` the root cause BEFORE any fix.** Do not guess, do not patch the symptom site. Trace the failure end-to-start and classify whose fault it is: test code (wrong assertion/setup), source/production code (real defect), or environment/infrastructure/data. Then route: test-code fault → `/integration-test-review` to fix the test at the root (never weaken assertions or add skips); source-code fault → fix the production defect at the owning layer and report it; environment fault → mark BLOCKED and point at the startup script. NEVER change a test to match broken code.
> 4. **60-second runtime cap — a slow test is a RED FLAG, not a tuning knob.** Local integration tests run fast. If any single test (or a stalled suite) exceeds ~60s, STOP and treat the slowness itself as a defect signal — deadlock, missing `await`, infinite poll/retry, a real network/external call, or an unbounded query. `/debug-investigate` the cause; NEVER paper over it by raising the timeout or extending the wait.
> 5. **Loop until the whole suite is green.** After fixing the validated root cause, restart the full 2-run verification from run 1. Done means the entire relevant suite passes repeatably — never green-once, never a subset.

Compressed pacing manufactures races the system was never designed to survive, then reports them as product defects.
> 3. **Wait on a real signal, never a blind sleep.** Find an observable proving the prior step finished — a persisted state change, an audit/version stamp, a queue/worker idle marker, a completion event — and poll until it settles (unchanged across a short stability window). Use a fixed delay ONLY when no observable exists, and say so in a comment.
> 4. **Barriers belong in ARRANGE, never in ASSERT.** Waiting for a precondition is fidelity. Widening an assertion's timeout, loosening a comparison, adding a retry around a failing assertion, or skipping the test is masking. NEVER do the latter to force green.
> 5. **Distinguish harness-amplified from real.** Test topologies (shared infra, fan-out consumers, parallel suites, cold starts) can make a rare production race routine locally. Before filing a product defect, state whether the trigger exists in production and at what likelihood.
> 6. **Keep the protected invariant intact.** Improving fidelity must NEVER reduce what the test protects. If a realistic scenario no longer exercises the rule, the rule needs a DIFFERENT realistic scenario — not a weaker assertion.
> 7. **Deliberate impossible-state tests are allowed, but MUST be labelled.** Corruption-repair, migration, and fail-safe tests intentionally construct states production should never reach; comment WHY the state is reachable (upstream bug, partial write, legacy data), so they are never confused with unrealistic setups.

>    - **SPEC-SILENT** — the code correctly enforces an invariant/behavior that NO canonical spec artifact (§3 AC, §4 BR, §5 invariant, §8 TC) states → not drift but an UNWRITTEN rule discovered by review.

"None" / "pure win" is an unfinished analysis, NOT an answer — to claim none, state which dimensions you checked and why each is unaffected: future change cost · complexity · performance/latency · memory/cost · coupling · reversibility · migration burden · operational load · blast radius · security posture · testability · team skill/ramp · delivery time · UX.
> 2. **Is it worth it?** Weigh gain against sacrifice EXPLICITLY — what is gained (with a metric) · what it costs · WHO pays · WHEN it comes due — then emit **WORTH IT / NOT WORTH IT / UNCLEAR**. "Better" with no metric and no cost FAILS this question. NOT WORTH IT → withdraw or replace the recommendation, never keep it as-is.
> 3. **Is the trade-off material enough to CONFIRM WITH THE USER?** A material trade-off is the user's call, never yours. **MATERIAL** when ANY holds: irreversible / one-way door (data migration, public contract, storage format, vendor lock-in) · cost shifted onto someone else (another team, ops/on-call, future maintainer, end user) · one quality attribute traded for another (correctness↔speed, security↔convenience, latency↔cost, simplicity↔flexibility) · a boundary crossed (client↔server tier, service contract, event contract, shared library) · a high-consequence path (auth, money, data integrity, breaking change, High/Medium residual risk) · the worth-it verdict is UNCLEAR.
>
> **MATERIAL → STOP and confirm via `AskUserQuestion` BEFORE the verdict stands** — state the trade-off, both options, what each sacrifices, and your recommendation. **NOT material →** record it inline with a one-line justification and proceed.
>
> **Non-asking execution contexts — ESCALATE BY HANDOFF, never by silence.** `AskUserQuestion` reaches only the main interactive agent: a sub-agent cannot ask the user, and a terminal/verdict-only mode asks nothing by design. When you are running in such a context, the obligation is **redirected, never waived** — do ALL of: (a) complete questions 1 and 2 normally; (b) decide materiality and record it in the Trade-Off Assessment row with `confirmed? = NO — cannot ask from this context`; (c) **name the unconfirmed MATERIAL trade-off explicitly in your returned summary/verdict so the CALLER (or parent orchestrator) escalates it via `AskUserQuestion` on your behalf** — a material trade-off mentioned only inside a report file on disk is NOT a handoff; (d) do not emit an unqualified PASS — mark the verdict as carrying an unconfirmed material trade-off, so the caller's gate stays closed until the user answers. The caller inherits the escalation duty the moment it reads your return.
>
> This carve-out is about **reachability, not convenience**: it applies ONLY where the tool genuinely cannot reach the user (spawned sub-agent, terminal validate/verdict-only mode, non-interactive/headless run). It is NEVER a licence to skip the question, to self-approve a one-way door, or to downgrade materiality because asking is inconvenient — if you CAN ask, you MUST ask.
>
> **Emit a Trade-Off Assessment row** per reviewed decision and per recommendation: `| decision | sacrifices | gain (metric) | who pays, when | WORTH IT/NOT/UNCLEAR | material? | confirmed? |`.
>
> **BLOCKED until:** trade-off named (or dimensions-checked justification given) · worth-it verdict emitted · materiality decided · every MATERIAL trade-off either confirmed with the user OR — in a non-asking context — handed off in the returned verdict for the caller to confirm. A MATERIAL trade-off that is neither confirmed nor handed off can NEVER be PASS, and NEVER gets buried as a Low-severity note.
>
> **NEVER** answer "no trade-off" without checking · decide a material trade-off silently on the user's behalf · let convergence/delivery pressure authorize walking through a one-way door · bundle several material trade-offs into one vague "proceed?".

>
> **Re-read files after context changes.** Context compaction, resume, or long-running work can make memory stale; verify current files before acting.
> **Verify generated content against source evidence.** AI hallucinates APIs, names, claims, and document facts. Check the relevant source before documenting or referencing.

> **Assume existing values are intentional — ask WHY before changing OR flagging one as a defect.** Before changing or reporting a constant, limit, flag, cutoff, wording, or pattern, read nearby context and history, the CALLER's ordering, and 2+ sibling call sites of the same convention. A doc stating WHAT without WHY is missing rationale, not proof of a missing guard.
> **Surface ambiguity before acting — don't pick silently.** Multiple valid interpretations require an explicit question or stated assumption with risk.

- **MANDATORY MUST ATTENTION ALWAYS ASK THE 3 TRADE-OFF QUESTIONS** — on the thing under review AND on every recommendation you make: (1) **is there any trade-off?** name what it SACRIFICES (change cost · complexity · perf · coupling · reversibility · migration · ops load · blast radius · security · testability · delivery time · UX) — "none"/"pure win" is an unfinished analysis, so state the dimensions checked; (2) **is it worth it?** gain (with a metric) vs cost, WHO pays, WHEN → emit **WORTH IT / NOT WORTH IT / UNCLEAR**; NOT WORTH IT → withdraw or replace it; (3) **is it material enough to confirm with the user?** irreversible/one-way door · cost shifted onto another team/ops/maintainer/user · one quality attribute traded for another · a tier/service/event/library boundary crossed · auth/money/data-integrity/breaking-change/High-or-Medium-risk path · verdict UNCLEAR → **STOP and confirm via `AskUserQuestion` BEFORE the verdict**.

- **MANDATORY — non-asking contexts escalate BY HANDOFF, never by silence.** `AskUserQuestion` reaches only the main interactive agent: a sub-agent cannot ask the user, and a terminal/verdict-only mode asks nothing by design. There the duty is REDIRECTED, not waived — still name the trade-off, still decide materiality, record `confirmed? = NO — cannot ask from this context`, **state the unconfirmed MATERIAL trade-off in your RETURNED verdict/summary so the CALLER escalates it** (a note only in an on-disk report is not a handoff), and never emit an unqualified PASS.

<!-- PROMPT-ENHANCE:STEP-TASK-CLOSING:END -->

## Closing Reminders

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION Goal:** Drive an integration-test suite to fully green — each round runs a FRESH full `/integration-test-verify` over `{scope}` (WHOLE SYSTEM by default), adjudicates every failure with `/debug-investigate` + `/integration-test-review` (report-only) into ONE Fault Verdict, fixes at the owning layer via `/fix`, and re-verifies — until zero failures across 2 consecutive runs without a DB reset, with no test lost, skipped, or weakened.

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION main steps (in order):** (0) resolve `{scope}` + Goal Contract → (0b) bind the convergence loop (protocol loop primary + optional `/goal` accelerator) → (1) round loop: snapshot → `/integration-test-verify` INLINE → record real counts → on failure `/debug-investigate` + `/integration-test-review` report-only → ONE Fault Verdict per failure → `/fix` at the owning layer → CONDITIONAL `/changes-review` on the round's fix diff when any fix landed → Round Integrity Check → append Iteration Log → (2) converge on a zero-failure 2/2-green fresh verify / escalate on non-progress, blocked environment, or lost coverage → (3) terminal `/spec [mode=sync]` + `/docs-update` (standalone only) + recap.

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION [BLOCKING] plan the detailed todo tasks FIRST — before running the loop.** Before the first round, create a detailed todo-task plan that enumerates every planned step and every planned round; a round MUST NOT start until that round's fresh todo-task plan exists. On EVERY re-run (each new round), REGENERATE a fresh loop todo-task plan — NEVER reuse the prior round's task list — so each round's work is explicitly planned before it executes.

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** `{scope}` defaults to the **WHOLE SYSTEM** (every test project via `testProjectPattern` > `testProjects`) and is passed to `/integration-test-verify` EXPLICITLY every round — NEVER let it fall through to its change-scoped default or git auto-detect (`integration-test-verify/SKILL.md:132,159`) — why: a loop that silently verifies only the changed subset reports "all green" for a system it never ran.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** `{scope}` is FIXED for the whole loop — it may widen when a fix adds a test project, but NEVER narrows. De-scoping to green is a regression, not convergence.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** each round pairs verify (find) + adjudicate (diagnose) + `/fix` (resolve) — never jump from a red test straight to an edit; an unadjudicated failure gets "fixed" by whatever is nearest, which is almost always the assertion.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** run `/integration-test-verify`, `/debug-investigate`, and `/integration-test-review` **INLINE via the `Skill` tool — NEVER as a sub-agent**: `/debug-investigate` requires its `/why-review` gate in the SAME session/main agent (`debug-investigate/SKILL.md:34`) and `/integration-test-review` self-binds its own fix/re-review obligations. Their OWN internal fan-outs (verify's per-project `integration-tester` agents, review's phase agents) stay sub-agents by their own design.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** run `/integration-test-review` in **REPORT-ONLY** mode — its 8 gates produce the test-side verdict, then it STOPS before its P5 fix / P6 re-review / P7 build-and-run; this loop owns fixing and re-running. If it self-fixes anyway, treat that as the round's fix half and SKIP `/fix` for that round — NEVER double-fix.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** emit ONE written Fault Verdict per failure BEFORE any edit — `TEST-WRONG` · `TEST-NOT-OPTIMAL` · `SOURCE-WRONG` · `ENVIRONMENT-BLOCKED` · `AMBIGUOUS` — each with `file:line` evidence and confidence; `AMBIGUOUS` → `AskUserQuestion`, NEVER a silent pick between source and test.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** `SOURCE-WRONG` → fix at the LOWEST invariant-owning layer (Entity > Service > Handler), never the crash site; KEEP or STRENGTHEN the test that caught it, and route the changed source into `/changes-review` before declaring PASS (`integration-test-verify/SKILL.md:294`).
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** `TEST-NOT-OPTIMAL` → repair the SCENARIO with an ARRANGE-phase settle barrier polling a real observable — NEVER a widened assertion timeout, a blind sleep, or a retry wrapped around a failing assertion.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** on an INTERMITTENT failure (red in one run of the 2-run gate, green in the other) apply the three-way flake adjudication BEFORE any change — (a) unrealistic scenario / compressed actor pacing, (b) harness topology amplification, (c) genuine product race — and do NOT file (c) until (a) and (b) are ruled out with evidence.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** run `/changes-review` (INLINE, report-only) on the round's fix diff in EVERY round that applied ANY fix — source, test, scenario, or spec alike; validate its findings and fold them into the SAME round's fix set; unfixable validated findings → STOP & escalate; no fix landed → skip with a recorded reason — why: the loop's only convergence signal is "tests went green", and a green test cannot see a wrong-layer fix, a broken invariant elsewhere, or a security/performance regression, so without this every fix the loop lands would ship un-code-reviewed.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** the per-round `/changes-review` SUBSUMES the `SOURCE-WRONG` verdict's own "route the changed source into `/changes-review`" obligation — run it ONCE per round over the whole fix diff, never twice for the same diff, and never open a nested review→fix loop inside a round (the next round's fresh full verify is the re-proof).
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** the **Round Integrity Check is BLOCKING** — executed test count must NOT decrease, skipped count must NOT increase, `{scope}` must NOT shrink; any of the three → STOP & escalate and restore the coverage — why: unlike a review loop, a test loop has a cheap fake exit — remove what fails.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** NEVER force green — no weakened or removed assertions, no skip annotations, no widened timeouts, no repository-hacked domain data, no narrowed scope. Fix the scenario or the product defect, then restart the 2-run gate from run 1.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** convergence requires ALL FIVE: a fresh full verify over post-fix code · zero failed tests · 2 consecutive green runs without a DB reset · real runner output (Passed/Failed/Skipped counts + names) · Round Integrity Check passed — plus the working-tree-unchanged backstop on the converging pass.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** enforce the **round cap (default 3)**; failing count not shrinking across 2 rounds, failures increasing, or cap hit with failures still open → **STOP & escalate** via `AskUserQuestion`. `ENVIRONMENT-BLOCKED` → escalate IMMEDIATELY and point at `startupScript` — never loop against an unhealthy system.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** run the terminal `/spec [mode=sync]` + `/docs-update` once converged when STANDALONE; SKIP them when a parent workflow already declares those steps, and say so in the recap. Do NOT commit or push unless the user explicitly asks.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** resolve and update the active Goal Contract — append per-round counts, Fault Verdicts, and fix evidence to the Iteration Log and matrix; NEVER copy raw sensitive fixture data into goal files.

**Anti-Rationalization:**

| "Only the changed tests matter"               | `{scope}` defaults to the WHOLE system and is passed explicitly. A subset green is not a suite green.                           |
| "That test was flaky, I skipped it"           | Skipped count increasing is a Round Integrity FAILURE → STOP & escalate. Adjudicate the flake (a)/(b)/(c) instead.              |
| "I deleted the obsolete test, now it's green" | Executed count decreasing is a REGRESSION, not convergence. Restore it and prove obsolescence against the spec first.           |
| "Root cause is obvious, just fix it"          | One written Fault Verdict per failure, with `file:line` evidence, BEFORE any edit. Nearest-attention fixes patch the assertion. |
| "The assertion is too strict"                 | Fix the code or the ARRANGE setup, never the assertion. A test that no longer protects its invariant is worse than no test.     |
| "Bump the timeout, it just needs longer"      | Widening a timeout masks all three flake causes. The barrier belongs in ARRANGE, on a real observable.                          |
| "It passed this time, ship it"                | 2 consecutive green runs without a DB reset, with real runner output, or it isn't verified.                                     |
| "Review already fixed it, and so did /fix"    | Report-only mode means `/fix` owns the fix. If review self-fixed, SKIP `/fix` that round — never double-fix.                    |
| "Tests are green, no need to review the fix"  | Green is exactly the blind spot — it cannot see a wrong-layer fix, a broken invariant elsewhere, or a security/perf regression. Any fix landed → `/changes-review` that round. |
| "I'll code-review everything at the end"      | A deferred review lets round 2 build on round 1's unreviewed fix. Review the fix diff in the round that lands it.               |
| "Round 3 hit, close enough"                   | Cap hit with failures open → STOP & escalate with the still-failing tests and their verdicts. Never silently continue.          |
| "The DB was down, I'll relax the test"        | `ENVIRONMENT-BLOCKED` → escalate and point at `startupScript`. NEVER change a test because the system was down.                 |

> **[IMPORTANT]** Use `TaskCreate` to break ALL work into small tasks BEFORE starting — analyze task size first.

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION Goal:** A fresh full `/integration-test-verify` over `{scope}` reporting ZERO failures across 2 consecutive runs without a DB reset — with no test deleted, skipped, or weakened to get there.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** adjudicate EVERY failure with `/debug-investigate` + `/integration-test-review` (report-only) into ONE Fault Verdict BEFORE any edit — test-wrong vs test-not-optimal vs source-wrong vs environment vs ambiguous.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** EVERY round that lands a fix runs `/changes-review` (INLINE, report-only) on that round's fix diff — no fix ever reaches the next round un-code-reviewed.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** the Round Integrity Check is BLOCKING and the round cap is 3 — a suite that got greener by losing tests regressed, and a loop that stops shrinking escalates instead of spinning.
