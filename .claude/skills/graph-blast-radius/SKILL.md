## Quick Summary

**Goal:** [Code Intelligence] Analyze the blast radius of current code changes using the structural knowledge graph. Shows impacted files, functions, test coverage gaps, and risk level. Requires graph to be built first via /graph-build.

**Workflow:**

1. **Detect** — classify request scope and target artifacts.
2. **Execute** — apply required steps with evidence-backed actions.
3. **Verify** — confirm constraints, output quality, and completion evidence.

**Key Rules:**

- MUST ATTENTION keep claims evidence-based (`file:line`) with confidence >80% to act.
- MUST ATTENTION keep task tracking updated as each step starts/completes.
- NEVER skip mandatory workflow or skill gates.

## Prerequisites

- Graph must be built first: run `/graph-build` if `.code-graph/graph.db` doesn't exist
- Requires Python 3.10+ with tree-sitter, tree-sitter-language-pack, networkx

## Steps

1. **Check graph exists** — Verify `.code-graph/graph.db` exists. If not, suggest `/graph-build`.

2. **Run blast-radius analysis** via Bash:

    ```bash
    python .claude/scripts/code_graph blast-radius --json
    ```

3. **Parse JSON output** and present:
    - **Changed files:** List of modified files (auto-detected from git)
    - **Changed nodes:** Functions/classes directly modified
    - **Impacted nodes:** Functions/classes affected within 2 hops (callers, dependents, tests)
    - **Impacted files:** Additional files that may need attention
    - **Truncation:** If results were truncated, note total vs shown

4. **Risk assessment** based on blast radius size:
    - **Low risk:** <5 impacted nodes, changes well-contained
    - **Medium risk:** 5-20 impacted nodes, review callers carefully
    - **High risk:** >20 impacted nodes, consider splitting PR

5. **Recommendations:**
    - Flag untested changed functions
    - Suggest files to prioritize in review
    - Warn about inheritance/implementation relationship changes

## Run the CLI Live (never expect pre-injected blast-radius)

This skill is the on-invoke home for blast-radius analysis. There is no auto-injected, pre-computed blast-radius context — you MUST ATTENTION **run the CLI yourself** to get LIVE impact data for the current working tree. Frozen/stale numbers are wrong by definition once the diff changes:

```bash
python .claude/scripts/code_graph blast-radius --json
```

## Post-Grep Trace Trigger (run a trace after grep surfaces a key file)

When a grep/glob during this analysis surfaces an important entry-point file — an entity, command, query, event/command handler, controller, bus message/consumer, component, store, or api-service — immediately run a graph trace on it before concluding. Grep finds files; the trace reveals callers, consumers, bus messages, event chains, and tests that grep CANNOT find:

```bash
python .claude/scripts/code_graph trace <key-entry-file> --direction both --json
```

**Pattern: grep finds files → graph trace reveals full system flow → grep verifies specific details.**

## Trace for Deep Impact Analysis

For impact beyond direct callers/importers, use the `trace` command to follow the full chain through implicit connections:

```bash
python .claude/scripts/code_graph trace <changed-file> --direction downstream --depth 3 --json

# File-level overview first (10-30x less noise), then drill into functions:
python .claude/scripts/code_graph trace <changed-file> --direction downstream --node-mode file --json
```

This reveals downstream impact through MESSAGE_BUS edges (cross-service event consumers), TRIGGERS_EVENT (entity event handlers), and other implicit relationships that blast-radius may not surface directly.

## Additional Queries

For deeper investigation, run via Bash:

- `python ... query callers_of <function> --json` — who calls this function?
- `python ... query tests_for <function> --json` — what tests cover this?
- `python ... query inheritors_of <class> --json` — what inherits from this?
- `python ... query importers_of <file> --json` — who imports this file?

# Blast Radius

Analyze the structural impact of current code changes using the knowledge graph.

<!-- PROTOCOL-GUIDES:START -->

> **Protocol guides** — A hook delivers each protocol's full text when this skill loads. If a protocol's text is not in your context, read its file below before you act on it.

- `ai-mistake-prevention` — Failure modes to avoid on every task; carried by the root instruction file; if it is absent, read → .claude/skills/shared/protocols/ai-mistake-prevention.md
- `critical-thinking-mindset` — Critical and sequential thinking with traced proof for every claim; carried by the root instruction file; if it is absent, read → .claude/skills/shared/protocols/critical-thinking-mindset.md
- `project-protocol-overlay` — Resolve the additive project overlays for the running skill; carried by the root instruction file; if it is absent, read → .claude/skills/shared/protocols/project-protocol-overlay.md

<!-- PROTOCOL-GUIDES:END -->

<!-- SYNC:critical-thinking-mindset:reminder -->

**MUST ATTENTION** critical + sequential thinking: every claim carries traced evidence (`file:line` for code, source URL or artifact section otherwise); confidence >80% to act, <60% do NOT recommend. Never present a guess as fact; admit uncertainty and stay skeptical of your own confidence.

<!-- /SYNC:critical-thinking-mindset:reminder -->

<!-- SYNC:ai-mistake-prevention:reminder -->

**MUST ATTENTION** Check project config, relevant references, and local evidence before applying stack-specific conventions; honor explicit N/A. ROOT-CAUSE GATE: before any project-related correction, use the appropriate root-cause investigation protocol; failed/unstable tests require the test-investigation protocol before editing source/tests — never force green.

<!-- /SYNC:ai-mistake-prevention:reminder -->

<!-- SYNC:project-protocol-overlay:reminder -->

**MUST ATTENTION** resolve this skill's overlays from the index at `<docsRoots.projectReference.path>/skill-protocols-reference.md` (default `docs/project-reference/`; overridable in `docs/project-config.json`); an empty task `referenceDocs` does NOT disable this lookup. Read ONLY matched bodies from the directory the index header names (default `docs/project-protocols/`). Specificity (exact > glob > `*`) ranks overlays against EACH OTHER, never against the skill. Missing/malformed body → report and skip; no index or no match → proceed silently. Overlays are ADDITIVE ONLY — never an authority escalation or a gate waiver; equal-tier contradiction goes to the user.

<!-- /SYNC:project-protocol-overlay:reminder -->

## Closing Reminders

**Protocols in force (concise digest of the SYNC/shared blocks this skill carries) — MUST ATTENTION honor each canonical body:**

- **AI Mistake Prevention:** verify generated content against evidence, trace downstream references, verify all affected outputs, re-read after context loss, surface ambiguity.
- **Critical Thinking:** traced `file:line` proof per claim, confidence >80% to act, NEVER guess as fact.

- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** break work into small todo tasks using `TaskCreate` BEFORE starting
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** search codebase for 3+ similar patterns before creating new code
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** cite `file:line` evidence for every claim (confidence >80% to act)
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** add a final review todo task to verify work quality

**[TASK-PLANNING]** Before acting, analyze task scope and systematically break it into small todo tasks and sub-tasks using TaskCreate.
