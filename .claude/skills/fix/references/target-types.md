# fix — `--target=types` — TypeScript / type-error branch

> Read by `/fix --target=types` FIRST, before any other step of the branch (the router `SKILL.md` → **Target Routing**). The Debug Mindset, Confidence & Evidence Gate, Root-Cause Prerequisite Gate and the `SYNC:*` protocol bodies this branch cites live in `SKILL.md`.

## `--target=types` — TypeScript / type-error branch

Run `tsc --noEmit` (or `nx build` / `bun run typecheck` / `npx tsc`) to gather all type errors, then:

1. **Collect** — Capture every type error with `file:line`.
2. **Classify** — Group by cause: missing types, wrong signatures, import/export issues.
3. **Fix at root** — Give each value its real, specific type (or `unknown` + a narrowing guard). Do NOT use `any` to silence the checker — `any` ships the underlying type defect. Fix the root cause (wrong interface, missing export), not the symptom site. — why: `any` silences the checker and lets the type defect ship.
4. **Repeat** until `tsc --noEmit` is clean — zero type errors.
5. **🛑 Validate Before Fix:** present errors + root cause via `ask user question tool`, get approval before code changes (skip if inside a workflow).

The Debug Mindset, Confidence & Evidence Gate, and all SYNC gates below apply to this branch unchanged.
