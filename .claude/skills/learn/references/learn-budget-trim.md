# Learn — `lessons.md` budget trim

> Read when adding a lesson would take `lessons.md` over its 20000-character hard limit, or on `/learn trim`.

## Budget Trim

**Budget Trim process:**

1. Display all current lessons with char count each
2. Evaluate each lesson on two axes:
    - **Universality** — How often does this apply? (every session vs rare edge case)
    - **Recurrence risk** — How likely is the AI to repeat this mistake without the reminder?
3. Score each: **HIGH** (keep as-is), **MEDIUM** (candidate to condense), **LOW** (candidate to remove)
4. Present to user with `ask user question tool`: "Budget exceeded. Recommend removing/condensing these LOW/MEDIUM items: [list]. Approve?"
5. On approval: condense MEDIUM items (shorten wording), remove LOW items, then save new lesson
6. On rejection: ask user which to remove/condense

**Condensing rules:**

- Remove examples, keep the rule: `"Patterns like X break Y syntax"` → just state the rule
- Merge related lessons into one if they share the same root cause
- Target: each lesson ≤ 250 chars (one concise sentence + bold title)
