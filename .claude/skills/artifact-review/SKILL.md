## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Review one artifact (PBI, design spec, story, or test spec) for completeness and quality so it is evidence-backed, handoff-ready, and free of missing assumptions or acceptance gaps. For generated PBIs, prove one independently releasable actor-facing outcome with a complete full-flow surface when UI is involved.

**Summary:**

- **Purpose:** review ONE artifact (PBI · user story set · test spec · design spec) for completeness + quality so it ships evidence-backed and handoff-ready — no missing assumptions, no acceptance gaps. Default stance = SKEPTIC, not presence-checker: sections that exist but hold weak/untestable content are worse than missing ones — they breed false confidence.
- **Main steps (in order):** (1) **Identify** type — dispatch on `--type={pbi|story|spec-tests|design}`, infer if omitted; (2) **Adversarial Mindset** — run ALL 6 techniques (steel-man rejected alternatives · stress-test 3 assumptions · AC-testability · pre-mortem · unseen alternatives · contrarian pass) + clear the Anti-Bias Gate before any verdict; (3) **Type checklist** — score Required + Recommended; (4) **M1-M7 gate** (BLOCKING, ALL types); (5) **Readability checklist**; (6) **Output** per-type template (verdict + Required/Recommended tallies + coverage/AC matrix); (7) **Validated-fix + full re-review loop** — validate findings → fix only current-round blocking findings → restart until the round bar is clear (Round 1: zero findings; Round 2: zero CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM, LOW deferred; binary gates always block).
- **Type dispatch + verdict:** each `--type` has its own Required/Recommended checklist and output template — verdict = PASS (all Required + ≥50% Recommended) | WARN (all Required, <50% Recommended) | FAIL (any Required fails).
- **M1-M7 gate (ALL types, BLOCKING):** any **M1-M5 or applicable M7** violation forces NEEDS WORK citing the mandate ID + exact section/line. For spec-test artifacts, resolve the project profile first: the strict TC/Section 8 profile applies only when no native case contract is declared; a native profile declared by config or required references supplies its logical IDs, section roles, evidence carriers, and case identities. Exempt source identifiers only in the selected profile's evidence carriers (the strict default uses `[Source:]`, `**Evidence**`, `CoveredBy`, legacy `IntegrationTest`, frontmatter, and Mermaid); flag leakage in narrative prose. **M7 (business-visibility) is judged on each applicable business case's BODY via the demo test, NOT its prose** — a tech-free-sounding case about a consumer/sync/handler passes M1 and STILL fails M7. — why: carriers preserve auditable code links, M1 governs vocabulary, and M7 governs subject matter.
- **Validated-fix loop:** before fixing, invoke `/why-review --validate-findings <report-path>` on the review report FIRST (validate-before-fix discipline, at parity with `/plan-review`) — NEVER edit the artifact to resolve findings before this gate returns CLEAN. Then fix only validated blocking findings, do not confirm-in-place, restart the FULL review (fresh `general-purpose` sub-agent — artifacts are NOT code), and loop until the current exit bar is clear (round 1: zero findings; round 2: zero CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM, LOW deferred).
- **PBI releaseability is a Required check:** every generated PBI MUST be one independently releasable actor-facing outcome with a complete entry-to-result journey. For UI PBIs, the review MUST also verify the page/view inventory, navigation, component inventory, applicable states, and full-flow demo surface; a technical-only PBI or single static screen FAILS.

**Workflow:**

1. **Identify** — What artifact type is being reviewed
2. **Checklist** — Apply type-specific quality criteria
3. **Verdict** — READY or NEEDS WORK with specific items

**Key Rules:**

- Use type-specific checklists
- Every NEEDS WORK item must be actionable
- Focus on completeness — never block on stylistic preferences
- PBI reviews MUST apply `.claude/skills/shared/releasable-pbi-contract.md`: a technical-only PBI, incomplete journey, or UI PBI without the required page/view, navigation, component, state, and demo surface is a Required-check failure.

**Be skeptical. Apply critical thinking, sequential thinking. Every claim needs traced proof, confidence percentages (Idea should be more than 80%).**

## First Principle — Easy to Change

> **The success metric of every coding decision is _future change cost_.**
> DRY, SRP, abstraction, design patterns, naming, layering, tests — every
> technique exists to serve one goal: **making the next change cheaper**.

When evaluating code, refactor, test, or abstraction, ask:
**does this make next change cheaper or more expensive?**

- Reject "best practices" raising change cost (premature abstraction,
  speculative generality, leaky indirection, ceremony without payoff).
- Name real enemies in findings: **coupling, hidden state, duplicated
  knowledge, unclear intent, irreversible decisions exposed too early**.
- Simpler design easy to change beats sophisticated design that isn't.

Apply this lens **before** invoking any specific rule, pattern, or checklist
below — if downstream rule would raise change cost, this principle wins.

## Adversarial Review Mindset (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**Default stance: SKEPTIC challenging artifact quality and completeness, not confirming presence of sections.**

> **Presence-quality confusion trap:** Artifact with all required sections LOOKS complete. But sections that exist yet contain weak, ambiguous, or untestable content are worse than missing sections — they create false confidence. This section forces quality challenge beyond existence checks.

### Adversarial Techniques (apply ALL before concluding)

**1. Steel-Man the Alternatives**
Before accepting chosen approach in any design artifact: argue FOR strongest rejected alternative as vigorously as possible. Would a senior domain expert seriously consider it? If yes — artifact's dismissal needs stronger justification.

**2. Assumption Stress Test**
List the 3 biggest assumptions embedded in artifact. For each: "What if this is wrong?" An artifact that breaks when 2 of its 3 core assumptions fail is fragile. Flag unaddressed failure modes.

**3. Acceptance Criteria Testability**
For each acceptance criterion: "Can a QA engineer write a specific automated test for this — without asking clarifying questions?" If not — AC is ambiguous. Flag it. Vague ACs ("feature works correctly") are NOT acceptance criteria.

**4. Pre-Mortem**
Assume artifact is implemented exactly as written and feature fails in production within 3 months. Write the most plausible failure scenario. If you can't find one, look harder — every implementation has a failure mode.

**5. Unseen Alternatives**
Identify 1-2 approaches NOT mentioned in artifact. Genuinely not considered, or considered and excluded without documented reasoning? Missing alternatives without exclusion reasoning = incomplete analysis.

**6. Contrarian Pass**
Before writing any verdict, generate at least 2 sentences arguing the OPPOSITE conclusion. Then decide which argument is stronger based on evidence.

### Forbidden Patterns

- **"Required sections present"** → Presence ≠ quality. What's IN them?
- **"Acceptance criteria are defined"** → Are they TESTABLE? Name the automated test for each.
- **"Scope is well-defined"** → What is explicitly OUT of scope? If nothing is out of scope, the scope is undefined.
- **"Alternatives were considered"** → Were they real alternatives, or strawmen set up to lose?
- **"Looks complete"** → What specific failure mode is NOT addressed?

### Anti-Bias Gate (MANDATORY before finalizing verdict)

- [ ] Steel-manned at least one rejected alternative
- [ ] Identified 3 hidden assumptions and stress-tested them
- [ ] Verified each AC is unambiguously testable (can write automated test without clarification)
- [ ] Ran pre-mortem (one concrete production failure scenario)
- [ ] Identified at least 1 unexamined alternative (not in artifact)
- [ ] Generated at least 2 sentences arguing the opposite verdict

If any box is unchecked → adversarial review incomplete. Go back.

## Type-Specific Checklists (`--type` dispatch)

Select the checklist + output template by artifact type. Pass `--type={pbi|story|spec-tests|design}` to force a type; if omitted, infer from the artifact (Phase 1 "Identify"). Each type scores **Required (all must pass)** + **Recommended (≥50% should pass)** → verdict **PASS** (all Required + ≥50% Recommended) | **WARN** (all Required, <50% Recommended) | **FAIL** (any Required fails).

| `--type`    | Artifact             | Output template                             |
| ----------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `pbi`       | Product Backlog Item | PBI Review Result                           |
| `story`     | User story set       | Story Review Result (+ AC Coverage Matrix)  |
| `spec-tests` | Test specification   | Test Spec Review Result (+ Coverage Matrix) |
| `design`    | Design spec          | Artifact Review                             |

### PBI Review (`--type=pbi`)

| #   | Check                                                                                                      | Presence                                                  | Quality Depth                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| --- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | **Releasable outcome and full flow are defined** — the PBI is an independently releasable actor-facing outcome, not a technical layer | Is the actor, outcome, complete journey, and gate evidence present? For UI, are pages/views, navigation, components, states, and demo journey present? | Can a stakeholder recognize the value from entry through result and exit? Are persistence, access, failure, recovery, and visible truth covered where applicable? Does the scope hide foundation/setup/migration work as the outcome? A UI PBI represented by one isolated screen FAILS. |
| 2   | **Problem statement is clear** — the problem being solved is described in concrete terms                   | Is a problem statement present? Is it 2+ sentences?       | Is the problem scoped correctly? Could it be framed differently to lead to a different (simpler) solution? Are symptoms confused with root cause?                                              |
| 3   | **Acceptance criteria are testable and measurable** — each AC can be verified by a test                    | Are ACs present? Do they use measurable language?         | Can a QA engineer write an automated test for EACH AC without clarification? Are they specific enough to catch regressions? Vague ACs ("feature works correctly") are not acceptance criteria. |
| 4   | **Scope is well-defined (what's in and out)** — both in-scope and out-of-scope items are explicitly listed | Is an in/out scope list present? Does it have both sides? | Are out-of-scope items specific enough to prevent scope creep? Is anything ambiguously in/out? A scope that says nothing is out of scope is an undefined scope.                                |
| 5   | **Dependencies are identified** — all external dependencies the PBI relies on are listed                   | Is a dependencies section present? Does it list items?    | Are ALL dependencies listed (technical, data, service, team)? Are "can-parallel" items truly safe to parallelize, or do they share a shared resource?                                          |
| 6   | **Business value is articulated** — the why behind the PBI is stated in terms of user or business outcome  | Is business value described?                              | Is the value quantified or just stated? Does it connect to a user outcome, not just a feature delivery? "Users can now do X" is better than "we implemented feature Y".                        |
| 7   | **Priority is assigned** — the PBI has an explicit priority level                                          | Is a priority level assigned?                             | Is priority justified with data (RICE/MoSCoW), or arbitrary? Is it consistent with other PBIs in the same sprint? A PBI that is "high priority" without justification is unranked.             |
| 8   | **Acceptance-criteria set is complete** — the ACs together cover the whole releasable outcome, not only the happy path | Is there an AC for every in-scope behavior, including the negative/failure, empty, permission-denied, and recovery paths the scope implies? | Could the PBI be marked done with every AC passing while a stated in-scope behavior is still missing? An AC set that admits that gap is incomplete — FAIL. Are ACs in GIVEN/WHEN/THEN (or equivalently structured) form so each is independently decidable? |
| 9   | **PO sign-off readiness** — a product owner could render a per-AC PASS/FAIL verdict from this artifact alone | Does each AC name the observable evidence that would settle it (test result, visible state, demo step)? Is the design approved where applicable, and are dependencies resolved or explicitly deferred? | Would two reviewers reach the SAME verdict on every AC? An AC whose verdict depends on the reviewer's taste or on unstated context is not sign-off-ready. Every AC must be decidable PASS or FAIL with named evidence — a criterion that can only be judged "looks fine" FAILS this check. |

### User Story Review (`--type=story`)

| #   | Check                                                                                                                    | Presence                                                       | Quality Depth                                                                                                                                                 |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | **Follows GIVEN/WHEN/THEN format** — the story uses the structured BDD format                                            | Are all three parts (GIVEN, WHEN, THEN) present?               | Are all 3 parts present AND meaningful? Or is GIVEN trivial ("Given a user exists")? A GIVEN that describes no precondition adds no value.                    |
| 2   | **Is independent (not dependent on other stories)** — the story can be implemented without requiring another story first | Is independence stated or inferable?                           | Would descoping other stories prevent this story from being implemented? Implicit dependencies are as blocking as explicit ones.                              |
| 3   | **Is estimable (team can size it)** — the team has enough information to assign story points                             | Is the story sized or estimable based on content?              | Does the team have enough info to estimate? Is "can't estimate" a sign of missing AC? If it can't be sized, it's not ready for sprint.                        |
| 4   | **Is small enough for one sprint** — the story fits within a single sprint's capacity                                    | Is the story sized at ≤8 story points or scoped to one sprint? | Could this be split further? Stories >8SP should always be split. A story that "could fit" in a sprint but requires multiple sub-systems is likely too large. |
| 5   | **Has acceptance criteria** — the story defines measurable conditions for completion                                     | Are acceptance criteria present?                               | Are criteria testable? Would they catch a bug if the feature works in 9/10 cases? ACs that only describe the happy path are incomplete.                       |

### Design Spec Review (`--type=design`)

| #   | Check                                                                                                                                         | Presence                                            | Quality Depth                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| --- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | **All component states covered (default, hover, active, disabled, error, loading)** — spec defines visual behavior for all interaction states | Are all 6 states defined?                           | Are edge-case states (error, loading) as fully designed as the default state, or sketched? An undesigned error state will be improvised in implementation.                                      |
| 2   | **Design tokens specified (colors, spacing, typography)** — specific token values are called out, not ad-hoc values                           | Are token references present instead of raw values? | Are tokens from the project's token system, or are new values introduced? New values outside the token system break design consistency silently.                                                |
| 3   | **Responsive behavior defined** — how the component adapts across breakpoints is documented                                                   | Are breakpoint behaviors defined?                   | Are ALL breakpoints covered, or only desktop and mobile? Tablet-specific layouts are the most frequently omitted. Are content truncation / overflow behaviors specified?                        |
| 4   | **Accessibility requirements noted** — WCAG-relevant requirements (color contrast, keyboard nav, ARIA) are documented                         | Are accessibility notes present?                    | Are requirements specific (WCAG level, contrast ratio) or vague ("should be accessible")? Vague accessibility notes produce non-compliant implementations. Is keyboard navigation flow defined? |
| 5   | **Interaction patterns documented** — animations, transitions, and user interaction flows are specified                                       | Are interaction behaviors described?                | Are timing and easing values specified? Is behavior defined for both forward and reverse interactions (e.g., open AND close)? Unspecified interactions are implemented inconsistently.          |
| 6   | **Linked from the Feature Spec** — the design-spec path is recorded in the governing Feature Spec frontmatter `design_spec:` key so the spec stays the navigable hub | Is the design-spec path present in the Feature Spec frontmatter `design_spec:` (or `mockup:`) key? | Does the recorded path resolve to THIS design-spec, and does the design-spec deepen the spec's tech-agnostic §6 interaction surface (same UX-role view names / observable states) rather than diverge from it? An unlinked design-spec is an orphan — FAIL. Contract: `SYNC:ui-intent-layer` (inlined in this skill). |

#### UI/UX Design Principles Pass — `--type=design` ONLY (9 dimensions)

> **Scope gate:** this pass applies to `--type=design` and to NOTHING else. `--type=pbi`, `--type=story`, and `--type=spec-tests` are UNAFFECTED — their checklists, tallies, and verdicts are unchanged. A design artifact for a feature with no user-facing surface skips the whole pass with the reason stated.

The 40 clauses of `SYNC:ui-ux-design-principles` (full body inlined below in this skill) bind the design-spec path in the **REVIEW** role: each clause is a fail-condition against the ARTIFACT — *does the spec SPECIFY the decision this clause demands, at a depth an implementer could not get wrong?* The missing specification is the finding; the reviewer names the gap, never supplies the value.

Run **NINE focused passes over the artifact — one dimension at a time**, never a simultaneous sweep (a simultaneous sweep degenerates into the presence-checking this skill's Adversarial Review Mindset already forbids). Answer each `Think:` prompt from first principles before looking for the gap.

**Every finding:** `UI-<clause>` + `file:line` (artifact section + line) + severity per `SYNC:severity-rubric` already in force (Critical/High/Medium/Low), folded into the EXISTING verdict machinery — a clause gap that leaves a Required check unmet drives that check to fail (**FAIL**); a gap that only weakens depth lands as a Recommended miss or an Action Item under **NEEDS WORK**. No new scale, no new verdict.

| #   | Dimension                 | Clauses            | `Think:`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| --- | ------------------------- | ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Visual Hierarchy & Layout | `UI-1.1`-`UI-1.5` | Does the spec name ONE focal element per view, or leave first-read priority to the implementer? Is grouping expressed as whitespace or as nested boxes? Are the empty, loading and error states specified as fully as the populated state, or sketched? |
| 2   | Typography                | `UI-2.1`-`UI-2.5` | Does the spec reference a fixed 6-step scale with named families/weights (max 2 families, 3 weights each), or ad-hoc sizes? Are body size (16px web, 17px mobile, never below 14px), measure (45-75 characters), and leading (1.5 body, 1.1-1.2 display) stated or assumed? |
| 3   | Colour & Contrast         | `UI-3.1`-`UI-3.4` | Are contrast ratios written as measured numbers (4.5:1 text, 3:1 UI edges) or as the word "accessible"? Does any state carry meaning by colour alone with no icon/label/position pair? Is dark mode specified as its own surface treatment, or implied as an inversion? |
| 4   | Spacing & Grid            | `UI-4.1`-`UI-4.4` | Is a single base unit (4px or 8px) declared, with every gap a multiple of it? Is spacing assigned to containers rather than children? Are breakpoints justified by where the layout fails, or copied from device names?                              |
| 5   | Interaction & Feedback    | `UI-5.1`-`UI-5.5` | Is a response under 100ms specified for every action? Are all 5 states plus loading enumerated per component? Is undo offered where the spec calls for a confirmation? Are motion duration/easing (150-250ms, ease-out) and reduced-motion behaviour written down? Is the focus ring's appearance specified rather than removed? |
| 6   | Navigation & IA           | `UI-6.1`-`UI-6.4` | Does each specified view answer where-am-I / what's-here / where-next? How many top-level destinations does the IA declare (max 5)? Are labels drawn from user vocabulary or internal naming? Does every state have a URL or a defined back path?    |
| 7   | Forms & Input             | `UI-7.1`-`UI-7.5` | Does the spec justify each field's existence today? Are labels specified as persistently visible rather than placeholders? Are validation timing (on blur), error placement, and remediation wording defined? Are keyboard type/autocomplete/autocapitalise declared per field? Is data preservation across error, navigation and refresh specified? |
| 8   | Mobile & Touch            | `UI-8.1`-`UI-8.4` | Are hit targets specified at >=44x44pt with 8px separation independent of icon size? Where does the spec place primary actions relative to the thumb zone? Is every gesture given a tappable equivalent? Are safe areas and keyboard avoidance addressed? _(No touch surface in the artifact → skip with the reason stated.)_ |
| 9   | Speed & Perceived Speed   | `UI-9.1`-`UI-9.4` | Does the spec choose skeleton vs spinner deliberately per surface? Is optimistic update with a VISIBLE rollback specified? Is reserved space defined for every async or media element so nothing shifts? Are offline, timeout and retry specified as designed states rather than left as edge cases? |

**No double-counting** with Design Spec checks 1-6: check 1 (6 component states) meets `UI-5.2`/`UI-1.5`; check 2 (design tokens) meets `UI-2.5`/`UI-4.1`/`UI-3.2`; check 3 (responsive) meets `UI-4.4`/`UI-8.*`; check 4 (accessibility) meets `UI-3.1`/`UI-3.3`/`UI-5.5`; check 5 (interaction patterns) meets `UI-5.4`/`UI-5.1`. Where they meet, emit ONE finding carrying BOTH citations at the HIGHER severity — never two findings for one gap.

**Precedence:** the project design-system / SCSS / token docs **OUTRANK** these clauses — a spec following the project's own scale, unit, breakpoints, or token pairs SATISFIES the clause. A genuine conflict is surfaced to the user with both sides, NEVER resolved silently.

### Test Spec Review (`--type=spec-tests`)

> **[BLOCKING] MUST ATTENTION resolve the case profile before applying this rubric.** Read `docs/project-config.json`, the required project-reference docs, and `.claude/skills/shared/sdd-artifact-contract.md`. If the config or required references declare a native case contract, use its canonical owner, logical IDs, section/field roles, evidence carriers, and cardinality. Use `shared/tc-format.md` and the TC/Section 8 rules below only when no native case contract is declared. Invalid, incomplete, unreadable, or contradictory profile evidence is `BLOCKED`/`UNKNOWN`; do not fall back to the TC default or claim coverage.
> **[BLOCKING] Read** `spec-principles.md` under the configured reference-docs root for local prose/evidence rules. Under the strict default, also use `shared/tc-format.md` for TC fields, priorities, and coverage. Under a native profile, apply the same semantic checks through its declared case and evidence fields; do not require a duplicate Section 8 registry or default-only field.
> **[BLOCKING] Tech-agnostic check:** flag framework/product/language/design-pattern names in behavioral prose as findings (per the selected profile's prose policy). Source paths, class names, and test identifiers are valid only inside declared evidence carriers; the strict default uses `**Evidence**`, `CoveredBy`, legacy `IntegrationTest`, `[Source:]`, frontmatter, and Mermaid. Never flag a declared carrier as narrative leakage.
> **[BLOCKING] Business-oriented cases and cardinality:** Each business case must state an actor-facing acceptance outcome, not merely mirror a class/method. Flag a case split or narrowed only to match code structure when the user-observable behavior and invariant are the same. Preserve the strict default's one-TC-to-many-tests rule when selected; a native profile may declare another cardinality. In every profile, MUST ATTENTION preserve owner-qualified scenario identity and any variant identity, and MUST ATTENTION trace every claimed result to its actual executor and inspected assertion. Repeated scenario IDs with distinct declared variants are not duplicates; exact duplicate owner/scenario/variant identities are.

#### Required (all must pass)

| #   | Check | Presence | Quality Depth |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | **Logical case identity** — every case follows the selected profile's identifier and owner rule; the strict default uses `TC-{FEATURE}-{NNN}`. | Does each case have a valid identity in the configured owner/carrier? | Are identities unique under the profile's full key, including owner and any declared variant? |
| 2 | **Actor/outcome coverage** — every in-scope user story or actor-facing outcome maps to at least one canonical case. | Is each story/outcome represented in the configured case set? | Does the case exercise the behavior, or merely cite a story ID? |
| 3 | **Requirement coverage** — each acceptance criterion or normative requirement maps to an applicable case. | Is every configured acceptance/requirement ID covered? | Would at least one mapped case fail if the criterion or requirement were violated? |
| 4 | **Healthy path** — each applicable outcome has a realistic success case. | Is a happy path present where the behavior permits success? | Does it assert the full observable outcome rather than a stub? |
| 5 | **Negative/failure path** — relevant errors, denied access, and invalid transitions have explicit cases. | Are negative paths represented where the contract requires them? | Do they assert the exact rejected outcome and preserve healthy behavior? |
| 6 | **No duplicate canonical cases** — identity uniqueness follows the selected profile. | Are exact profile identities unique? | Flag cases with the same intent and identity; under a native profile, distinct declared variants of one scenario are valid and must remain distinct. |
| 7 | **Meaningful expected outcome and assertion** — each case states a precise expected positive or negative outcome. | Is an authored expected value/state present in the configured carrier? | Would the mapped assertion fail if the protected outcome were wrong? An ID, comment, or aggregate result alone is not assertion proof. |
| 8 | **Intent / invariant guarded** — each executable case names the business intent or technical contract it protects. | Is the guarded intent stated in the profile's case/rationale field or an equivalent carrier? | Would the assertion fail if that intent or invariant broke? |
| 9 | **Authorization coverage** — each story or actor outcome with an authorization boundary includes a denied-access case. | Is a negative authorization case present for each applicable story/outcome? | Does it use a realistic unauthorized principal and assert the denied outcome while preserving authorized behavior? |
| 10 | **Profile format and coverage evidence** — the required fields and links match the selected profile. | Under the default, are required TC fields and `CoveredBy:` present? Under a native profile, are its required fields and case-to-test relation used? | For every claimed tested case, can the reviewer follow its owner/case/variant identity to the actual executor and inspected assertion, or an explicitly approved manual-QC carrier? `UNKNOWN`/unresolved is never PASS. |
| 11 | **Preservation cases (bugfix context)** — pre-existing healthy behavior remains protected. | Is the relevant preservation case present when a bug fix could regress existing behavior? | Would its assertion detect recurrence, not merely prove that no exception occurred? |
| 12 | **Invariant/property and boundary coverage** — each universal hard rule has a universally quantified property plus a boundary counter-case. | Does every applicable hard rule/invariant in the configured contract sections (default: `[HARD]` §4 and §5) map to both cases? | Would the property and boundary assertion fail if the invariant broke? A single example is insufficient. |
| 13 | **UI interaction intent (UI-bearing specs)** — required views, navigation, observable states, and user flows are present in the selected profile. | Under the default, are §6.2–§6.5 present or is the backend-only skip reason stated? Under a native profile, are its declared interaction fields covered? | Is UI intent linked to configured logical IDs and M1-clean, with visual fidelity left to its linked design artifact? An absent applicable interaction contract is a finding. |

> **[BLOCKING] Spec-Loop property coverage (`--type=spec-tests`):** Verify every universal hard rule/invariant in the selected contract sections maps to a universally quantified property case **and** a boundary counter-case. For the strict default, these are `[HARD]` §4/§5 invariants and property TCs. For a native profile, resolve the configured contract section and case carrier. Example-only coverage is a blocking finding; a missing/unresolvable property case is `NEEDS WORK` or `BLOCKED`, never a pass.

#### Recommended (≥50% should pass)

| 1   | **Edge cases** — Boundary values, empty inputs, max limits tested                                                                                           | Are edge cases listed in the selected carrier?                           | Are these the RIGHT edge cases? Do they cover the 3 most likely production failure modes for this feature?                  |
| 2   | **Integration points** — Cross-service scenarios covered                                                                                                    | Are cross-service cases present where applicable?                        | Do integration cases verify actual data flow across services, or just that a downstream call was made?                     |
| 3   | **Performance cases** — Response time or throughput expectations where relevant; production-like data volume cases if >1000 records expected                 | Are performance cases present where data volume or SLA expectations exist?| Do they use production-like data volumes, not toy datasets that trivially pass?                                            |
| 4   | **Security cases** — Auth, authorization, input validation tested                                                                                           | Are security cases present for auth, authz, and input validation?        | Do they attempt realistic attack vectors (SQLi, over-posting, privilege escalation) not just "invalid token → 401"?       |
| 5   | **Seed data cases** — If feature needs reference data, cases verify data exists and seeding produces the intended state                                      | If reference data is needed, is a case present (or N/A)?                 | If present, does the case assert the exact seeded data shape, not just that the seeder ran without error?                   |
| 6   | **Data migration cases** — If schema changes exist, cases verify transforms, rollback behavior, and absence of data loss                                    | If schema changes exist, is a migration case present (or N/A)?           | If present, does it verify rollback behavior and zero data loss, not just forward migration success?                        |
| 7   | **Test data requirements specified** — the data setup needed to run each test is documented                                                                 | Are test data requirements stated per test?                              | Is test data specific enough to create fixtures without guessing? Vague data requirements ("a valid user") will cause test setup divergence across environments. |
| 8   | **GIVEN/WHEN/THEN format used** — tests follow the structured BDD format                                                                                    | Are all tests written in GIVEN/WHEN/THEN?                                | Are the THEN clauses assertions on observable outcomes, or on internal state? Tests asserting on internal state are brittle and break on refactoring.            |

## M1-M7 Compliance Gate (BLOCKING — applies to ALL artifact types)

> **Contract:** See `.claude/skills/shared/sdd-artifact-contract.md` → "AI-SDD Mandates (M1-M7)". This review enforces M6: any artifact (PBI, story, design spec, test spec) that violates **M1-M5 or M7** MUST receive a NEEDS WORK verdict that names the violated mandate ID and cites the exact section + line. Passing an **M1-M5/M7** violation makes this review itself defective. (M6 binds THIS review, not the artifact — which is why the artifact-facing set reads M1-M5 **and M7**, never "M1-M6".)
>
> Carriers are EXEMPT from M1/M2 — source identifiers belong in the selected profile's declared evidence carriers. The strict default uses `[Source: ...]`, `**Evidence**`, `**CoveredBy**`, legacy `**IntegrationTest**`, YAML frontmatter, and Mermaid. Only flag leakage in narrative prose (descriptions, AC/scenario text, rule statements). Banned prose token list: `spec-principles.md` §3.2 under the configured reference-docs root.

- [ ] **M1 — Tech-agnostic prose.** FAIL if narrative prose, headings, summaries, or AC/scenario text name a framework/product, a language-native type, or a product/design-pattern class name (banned-token list in `spec-principles.md` §3.2). Cite the section + leaked token.
- [ ] **M2 — No source code in prose.** FAIL if prose expresses behavior as a class/method/file-path/namespace used as a noun (e.g. "call the create-async method") instead of the business operation (e.g. "create the record"). Source identifiers belong only in evidence carriers. Cite the section + line.
- [ ] **M3 — Profile-owned traceability.** FAIL if a requirement, rule, acceptance criterion, or canonical case lacks the selected profile's logical identity or required source/evidence link. Under the strict default, require `FR-/BR-/OP-/TC-` IDs and a secondary `[Source: namespace/service/id]` abstract anchor; physical coordinates belong only in the provenance sidecar. Under a native profile, use its declared identifiers and evidence carriers without imposing a second abstract-anchor or TC registry. If the profile does not resolve the required identity/evidence form, report `BLOCKED`/`UNKNOWN`; never infer a pass.
- [ ] **M4 — Unambiguous, observable criteria.** FAIL if AC/expected-result prose uses vague language ("handle appropriately", "process normally", "as needed"), OR two engineers could implement it differently while both claiming conformance, OR no observable completion state / named error condition exists. (Reinforces the AC-testability technique above.)
- [ ] **M5 — Rebuild-from-artifact.** FAIL if a competent team with ZERO codebase knowledge could not re-implement the described behavior on a different stack from the artifact alone (it relies on reading source to be understood). Cite the section + the missing detail.
- [ ] **M7 — Business-visibility (business-tree artifacts only).** Apply **the demo test to each case's BODY**: *"what would a stakeholder SEE change?"* — **no answer → FAIL as TECHNICAL-ONLY.** Every `Given` must be a state a user could arrange, every `When` an action a user could take, every `Then` an outcome a user could see. FAIL a case whose `When` is an invocation (a handler runs, a consumer receives, a job fires, a model is inspected, data syncs) or whose `Then` asserts a schema/type/nullability/column/call-count rather than a business outcome. **Judge the BODY, never the title or ID** — a business-sounding title routinely fronts an invocation-shaped `When`. Cite the case ID + the offending `When`/`Then` clause.

> 🔴 **M1 vs M7 — the distinction this gate exists for.** M1 governs **vocabulary**; M7 governs **subject matter**. **A technical case written in impeccably tech-free prose satisfies M1 while violating M7** — and that gap is the single most common way business specs rot: each bugfix adds one more tech-free-sounding case about a consumer, a sync, or a load path, every M1 check passes, and the business tree fills with cases no one can demo. ⚠️ **Passing a case because its prose is clean is the exact failure this box catches.** ⚠️ Conversely, do NOT fail a case merely for containing a technical-sounding noun: if a user or QC can demo the outcome, it is business — **M7 asks what the case is ABOUT, not which words it uses.**

If ANY box fails → verdict is NEEDS WORK; list each violated mandate ID with its concrete section/line citation in the Action Items.

## Readability Checklist (MUST ATTENTION evaluate)

Before approving, verify code is **easy to read, easy to maintain, easy to understand**:

- **Schema visibility** — If function computes a data structure (object, map, config), a comment should show output shape so readers don't trace the code
- **Non-obvious data flows** — If data transforms through multiple steps (A → B → C), a brief comment should explain the pipeline
- **Self-documenting signatures** — Function params should explain their role; flag unused params
- **Magic values** — Unexplained numbers/strings should be named constants or have inline rationale
- **Naming clarity** — Variables/functions should reveal intent without reading the implementation

## Output Format (per `--type`)

Pick the template matching `--type`. All templates lead with a **Status/Verdict** and `### Required`/`### Recommended` tallies; the `pbi`/`story`/`spec-tests` shapes add their own evidence sections (preserved verbatim from the former `refine-review`, `story-review`, `tdd-spec-review` skills).

## Validated Fix + Full Re-Review (MANDATORY when fixes are applied)

> **Protocol:** `SYNC:double-round-trip-review` + `SYNC:fresh-context-review` + `SYNC:review-protocol-injection` (all inlined above in this file).

Do not spawn a fresh sub-agent just to re-review the same finding set before fixing it. If the artifact needs work, fix actionable findings first, then restart the full artifact review over the current artifact. When that restarted review uses a fresh `general-purpose` sub-agent, use the canonical Agent template from `SYNC:review-protocol-injection` above. Artifact reviews (PBI, story, design spec, test spec) are NOT code — use `subagent_type: "general-purpose"`, not `"code-reviewer"`. When constructing the Agent call prompt:

1. Copy the Agent call shape from the `SYNC:review-protocol-injection` template verbatim
2. Set `subagent_type: "general-purpose"`
3. Embed the full verbatim body of these SYNC blocks (inlined above in this skill file): `SYNC:evidence-based-reasoning`, `SYNC:rationalization-prevention`, `SYNC:understand-code-first` (omit code-specific protocols like `SYNC:bug-detection`, `SYNC:design-patterns-quality`, `SYNC:fix-layer-accountability` which are not applicable to artifact files)
4. Set the Task as `"Run a full fresh artifact review over the current {artifact-type} after fixes were applied. Focus on: implicit assumptions, missing coverage of edge cases / error scenarios, unverified cross-references, completeness gaps only visible on second reading, whether acceptance criteria are truly testable and measurable, and regressions introduced by fixes."`
5. Set Target Files as the explicit artifact file path(s)
6. Set report path as `tmp/reports/artifact-review-rerun{N}-{date}.md`

After sub-agent returns:

1. **Read** the sub-agent's report
2. **Integrate** findings as `## Re-Review {N} Findings` in the main report — DO NOT filter or override
3. **If NEEDS WORK:** fix actionable artifact findings, then restart the full artifact review from the beginning
4. **Repeated blocker cap:** if the same blocker repeats across 2 full invocations with no progress, escalate via `AskUserQuestion`
5. **Final verdict** must incorporate findings from ALL review passes that actually ran

## IMPORTANT Task Planning Notes (MUST ATTENTION FOLLOW)

- Always plan and break work into many small todo tasks using `TaskCreate`
- Always add a final review todo task to verify work quality and identify fixes/enhancements

---

## Bulk Multi-Artifact Sweeps

> For bulk multi-artifact review (10+ artifacts at once), use `/changes-review` — its Systematic Review Protocol categorizes the set and fires parallel sub-agents.

## AI Agent Integrity Gate (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

> **Completion ≠ Correctness.** Before reporting ANY work done, prove it:
>
> 1. **Grep every removed name.** Extraction/rename/delete touched N files? Grep confirms 0 dangling refs across ALL file types.
> 2. **Ask WHY before changing.** Existing values are intentional until proven otherwise. No "fix" without traced rationale.
> 3. **Verify ALL outputs.** One build passing ≠ all builds passing. Check every affected stack.
> 4. **Evaluate pattern fit.** Copying nearby code? Verify preconditions match — same scope, lifetime, base class, constraints.
> 5. **New artifact = wired artifact.** Created something? Prove it's registered, imported, and reachable by all consumers.

> **[IMPORTANT]** Use `TaskCreate` to break ALL work into small tasks BEFORE starting — including tasks for each file read. This prevents context loss from long files. For simple tasks, AI MUST ATTENTION ask user whether to skip.

**Prerequisites:** **MUST ATTENTION READ** before executing:

> **OOP & DRY Enforcement:** MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION — flag duplicated patterns that should be extracted to a base class, generic, or helper. Classes in the same group or suffix (ex *Entity, *Dto, \*Service, etc...) MUST ATTENTION inherit a common base (even if empty now — enables future shared logic and child overrides). Verify project has code linting/analyzer configured for the stack.

<!-- SYNC:nested-task-creation -->

> **Nested Task Expansion Contract** — For workflow-step invocation, the `[Workflow] ...` row is only a parent container; the child skill still creates visible phase tasks.
>
> 1. Call `TaskList` first. If a matching active parent workflow row exists, set `nested=true` and record `parentTaskId`; otherwise run standalone.

> 5. Mark exactly one child `in_progress` before work and `completed` immediately after evidence is written.
> 6. Complete the parent only after all child tasks are completed or explicitly cancelled with reason.
>

<!-- SYNC:project-reference-docs-guide -->

> **Project Reference Docs Gate (static JIT)** — Run after task-tracking bootstrap and immediately before target/source file reads, grep, edits, tests, or analysis. Project docs override generic framework assumptions; hooks may remind or accelerate this gate, but never prove that it ran.
>
> 1. Identify scope: file types, domain area, and operation.
> 2. **Read the configured project-config file first, if it exists.** Resolve its path through the project-config loader (default `docs/project-config.json`). **The project config is OPTIONAL: a project with no config is a supported, first-class state, not an error.** When it is absent, run on the framework's portable defaults and derive project facts (paths, run commands, conventions, architecture, test and spec layout) from repository evidence — manifests, lockfiles, scripts, CI definitions, directory layout, root instruction files — stating the assumption whenever one is material; do not block, and do not demand a bootstrap route before ordinary work. When it IS present, the minimum valid shape has a non-empty `project.name`; omitted optional capability properties use neutral defaults or skip that capability. A section its author DECLARED but left malformed or incomplete is a configuration error: fail closed on that section and run `/project-init` or `/project-config` before relying on it, because silently substituting defaults would present wrong project facts as authoritative. Use valid config for the adopter's paths, commands, architecture, specs, tests, and workflows, then verify material hints against repository evidence; never assume generic defaults are project facts.
> 3. **Always-on vs task-specific references:** Project initialization owns and ensures the project's `lessons.md` and docs-index inputs at their configured owner paths. Read them under the static project-context contract independently of task-specific `referenceDocs`; do not append them to that selection. For task-specific docs, when the configured `referenceDocs` property is an array, follow it exactly, including subsets and `[]`. When absent, use the runtime capability-aware resolver: its portable baseline plus only configuration- or repository-evidenced capabilities; a minimal project with no capability evidence may resolve to an empty task-specific set. The full scan-target manifest is a registry of metadata/aliases, not a default selection. Resolve configured paths using `docsRoots.projectReference.path` when present (default `docs/project-reference`; `docsRoots.projectReference.path` in `docs/project-config.json` overrides it). A custom reference doc declares `filename` and `purpose`, with optional `sections`, `templatePath`, and `scanTarget`. Built-in filenames keep their exact framework-owned target; other custom docs default to manual ownership, while `scanTarget: "generic"` opts one exact selected file into evidence-based scanning. Manual docs are not freshness-tracked or impact-routed. Never infer a target by basename; config and runtime path resolution reject lexical traversal and physical symlink escapes.
> 4. Read selected task-specific docs just in time before target work, then state: `Reference docs read: ... | Not applicable: ...`; an explicit empty selection means no task-specific docs are selected by the catalog. Still honor separately required references named by the active skill or task. An absent project config is not a missing doc: proceed on repository evidence and, at most, OFFER `/project-init` or `/project-config` as an optional one-time recording of those facts. If an always-on input or a selected/otherwise required doc is missing or stale, or a declared config section is malformed, use `/project-init` or the narrow owner route (`/project-config`, `/docs-init`, `/scan --target=<key>`, `/ai-context-refresh`) before relying on that input. If Codex mirrors are stale, use the explicit `/sync-codex` route or its documented `/ai-context-refresh` completion handoff for the active source-authoring task. After compaction, resume, delegation, or material context change, repeat selection and reading; prior conversation and hook output are not proof of current loading.
>
> **Ready when:** scope evaluated, the configured project-config file consulted or its absence recorded and the portable-defaults fallback applied, root always-on inputs are confirmed (completing project initialization if they are missing or stale), the declared task-specific `referenceDocs` selection is applied exactly or, when absent, the runtime capability-aware resolver output is applied (which may be empty), selected docs are read or an explicit empty selection is recorded, and the citation emitted.

<!-- SYNC:double-round-trip-review -->

> **Validated-Finding Fix + Full Re-Review Loop** — Re-review is triggered by a validated finding fix cycle or an explicitly declared independent-pass minimum, not by a round number alone. Review purpose: `review → validate findings → fix validated findings that block the current round → full re-review` until a complete review pass clears the round's exit bar (see **Severity floor** below). **A clean review ENDS the loop once the persisted `minRounds` is met (default 1); an explicitly declared minimum such as 2 still requires that independent pass.**
>
> _aka **Self-Review Convergence Loop**._ The name is historical — "double-round-trip" means a validated-finding fix cycle forces at least one fresh re-review. It runs until the current round's exit bar is clear (round 1: zero findings; round 2: zero CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM, LOW deferred), bounded by the **2-round ceiling — extendable ONCE to round 3 when CRITICAL/HIGH remain** — defined below. A failing **test gate** (a suite that must actually pass) is outside that ceiling: the loop keeps fixing and re-running until the tests pass.
>
> **Round cap — 2 rounds MAX, extendable ONCE to round 3 (a ceiling, NEVER a target).** A clean pass ENDS the loop at ANY round once `round >= minRounds` — round 1 included with the default minimum; the cap never obliges an extra round. What happens when round 2 completes with blocking findings still open (severity floor applied) depends on WHAT is still open:
>
> - **Validated CRITICAL or HIGH still open → ONE extra round is granted (round 3, the review hard cap).** A failed non-test binary gate (security must-fix, required artifact, generated parity, policy compliance) counts as a CRITICAL blocker here. The extension is earned by that evidence alone, is never a default, is granted at most once per run, and never renews. Record the granting findings in the run record and report.
> - **Only MEDIUM (or an unresolved `NOT VERIFIABLE`) still open → NO extension.** → **STOP and escalate via `AskUserQuestion`** with the still-open findings listed.
> - **Round 3 completes with ANY review blocker still open → STOP and escalate via `AskUserQuestion`.** Round 3 is the review hard cap; no review finding or non-test gate opens a round 4.
> - **A failing TEST gate → NO round cap, at any round.** Failing tests never escalate for budget or no-progress and never buy or spend the extension: run the failed-test investigation gate, fix at the owning layer, and re-run until the tests pass — past round 3 if needed. NEVER weaken an assertion, add a skip, or relax a timeout to force green. Review blockers open beside failing tests still follow the bullets above.
>
> NEVER emit a silent "good enough" PASS on cap exhaustion, NEVER let the cap substitute for the clean-review requirement, and NEVER loop past round 3 on review blockers — only failing test gates continue beyond it. The 2-repeated-no-progress blocker rule stays an EARLIER exit — escalate at whichever trips first.
>
> **Severity floor — from round 2, LOW stops blocking.** The exit bar tightens after the first review pass, so the loop converges on consequence instead of spinning on polish:

> Define one predicate everywhere: `blocking_findings(round, findings)` returns all validated findings in round 1 and only validated CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM findings from round 2 onward. A binary gate (test-green, security must-fix, required artifact) is exempt only when its owning invariant explicitly says so; in practice binary gates always remain blocking when they fail.
>
> | Round | Exit bar — loop ENDS when the fresh full review has… | Must be fixed to continue |
> | --- | --- | --- |
> | 1 | zero validated findings at ANY severity | CRITICAL · HIGH · MEDIUM · LOW |
> | 2 | zero validated CRITICAL / HIGH / MEDIUM findings — **LOW-only clears the severity bar** | CRITICAL · HIGH · MEDIUM only |
> | 3 — extension round, reachable ONLY when round 2 left CRITICAL/HIGH open (or failing tests were the only blocker) | zero validated CRITICAL / HIGH / MEDIUM findings — **LOW-only clears the severity bar** | CRITICAL · HIGH · MEDIUM only |
> | 4+ — test-gate continuation, reachable ONLY while failing test gates were the sole blocker | the tests pass and no review blocker is open | failing tests; any review blocker here escalates |
>
> From round 2 onward LOW findings are **NOT required to be fixed**: a round whose validated findings are ALL LOW **ENDS the loop once the persisted minimum is met** — do not open another fix/re-review round for them. Severity tiers are `SYNC:severity-rubric` (CRITICAL block-merge · HIGH must-fix · MEDIUM must clear the current round · LOW record/defer); round 1 remains strict, so a LOW found initially is still validated and fixed when warranted before the floor can apply.
>
> **Severity-floor rules:**
>
> - **Never silently drop a deferred LOW.** Every unfixed LOW is listed in the final report under `## Deferred LOW Findings (severity floor, round ≥2)` with file, line, and description, so the owner can schedule it. Dropping it from the report is a protocol violation, not a clean pass.
> - **Never re-tier a finding to trigger the exit.** Downgrading a real CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM to LOW so the loop can end is a FALSE PASS. Severity is set by consequence per `SYNC:severity-rubric` before the round bar is applied — never after, and never with the exit in view. — why: a floor that can be reached by relabeling is not a floor.
> - **Never re-tier a finding to reach — or to dodge — the extension.** The extension is unlocked by a real CRITICAL/HIGH, so promoting a MEDIUM to HIGH to buy round 3, or demoting a real CRITICAL/HIGH to MEDIUM to force an earlier escalation, are both FALSE classifications. Severity is set by consequence before the round bar and the extension test are applied. — why: an extension that can be reached by relabeling bounds nothing.
> - **The floor bounds the loop, not the standard.** It ends *iteration*; it never authorizes shipping a known CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM, and it never lowers the finding-survival bar that admits a finding in the first place.
> - **The floor never applies to a hard gate.** Test-green gates (a suite must actually pass), security must-fix gates, and any gate whose criterion is binary rather than severity-rated are unaffected — a failing test is a failure, not a LOW finding.
>
> **Universal scope (any new output/judgment):** any newly produced output or judgment gets **≥1 self-review**; any **new judgment** gets **≥1 `/why-review --validate-findings` pass**; anything flagged to re-check is re-checked **≥1 time** — before that output is treated as final. This loop is the default convergence contract for ANY work-producing skill, not review skills only.
>
> **Routing invariant (author-facing):** a skill that validates findings MUST route them through `/why-review --validate-findings` (the terminal validator) — NEVER fork an inline finding-validation. Routing through why-review is what makes the finding-survival bar and this loop apply; the `verify-review-validate-coverage` sensor enforces this exact route mechanically.
>
> **Round 1:** Main-session review. Read target files, build understanding, note issues. Output findings + verdict (PASS / FAIL).
>
> **Decision after Round 1:**
>
> - **No issues found (PASS, zero findings)** → review ENDS if `round >= minRounds`; otherwise perform the explicitly required independent pass. Do NOT invent a confirmation pass.
> - **`blocking_findings(round, findings)` is non-empty** → run the active review skill's findings-validation gate first; for review skills the default gate is `/why-review --validate-findings <report-path>`. Fix only validated findings that block the current round, then restart the full review protocol from the beginning with a fresh task breakdown.
>
> **Fresh full re-review after every fix cycle:** Re-run the whole review protocol over the current full target. When sub-agents are part of that protocol, spawn NEW `Agent` calls — never reuse prior agents. Reviewers re-read ALL files from scratch with ZERO memory of prior rounds. See `SYNC:fresh-context-review` for the spawn mechanism and `SYNC:review-protocol-injection` for the canonical Agent prompt template. Each fresh full review must catch:
>
> - Cross-cutting concerns missed in the prior round
> - Interaction bugs between changed files
> - Convention drift (new code vs existing patterns)
> - Missing pieces that should exist but don't
> - Subtle edge cases the prior round rationalized away
> - Regressions introduced by the fixes themselves
>
> **Loop termination:** After each full re-review, repeat the same decision against **that round's exit bar**: bar cleared and persisted minimum met → END; blocking findings remain → validate findings → fix → restart from the first review phase. Round 1 clears only on zero findings at any severity; **from round 2 the bar is zero CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM, so a LOW-only round ENDS the loop once the persisted minimum is met** (deferred LOWs go in the report). Capped at **2 rounds, extendable ONCE to round 3 when round 2 leaves validated CRITICAL/HIGH open**. Escalate via `AskUserQuestion` at whichever comes first: the same validated finding repeats for 2 full invocations with no progress · a fix requires product/owner input · round 2 completes with MEDIUM-only (or `NOT VERIFIABLE`) blocking, which earns no extension · round 3 completes with any review blocker still open. A failing test gate triggers none of these escalations — it loops until green. NEVER loop past round 3 on review blockers, and NEVER convert cap exhaustion into a PASS.
>
> **Rules:**
>
> - A clean Round 1 ENDS the review when `minRounds=1`; an explicitly declared `minRounds=2` requires the independent second pass
> - From round 2 on, a round whose validated findings are ALL LOW ENDS the loop once the persisted minimum is met — never open round N+1 to fix LOW alone; list those LOWs as deferred instead
> - NEVER re-tier a CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM down to LOW to reach the round-2 exit — severity is assigned by consequence before the bar is applied
> - NEVER fix unvalidated findings; validate first using the caller's validation gate
> - Every surviving finding must additionally clear the **finding-survival bar** defined in why-review's Findings Validation Routine (a deliberately higher bar than the generic act-gate — "keep this finding?" is a stricter question than "act on this evidence?"); a finding below the bar is demoted or dropped, not kept
> - NEVER skip the full re-review after a fix cycle (every fix invalidates the prior verdict)
> - NEVER reuse a sub-agent across rounds — every iteration that uses sub-agents spawns NEW Agent calls
> - Main agent READS sub-agent reports but MUST NOT filter, reinterpret, or override findings
> - The round cap NEVER replaces the clean-review requirement — it bounds runaway looping, it does not authorize shipping an un-clean review; a clean pass ends the loop early once the persisted minimum is met, and cap exhaustion escalates rather than passes
> - Enforce the base cap of 2 rounds, the single conditional extension to round 3 (unlocked ONLY by validated CRITICAL/HIGH open at round 2; a failed non-test binary gate counts as CRITICAL), and the 2 repeated-no-progress blocker rule together; all three are escalation triggers for review blockers, none is a completion criterion
> - The extension is granted at most ONCE per run and never renews — round 3 is the review hard cap regardless of what it finds
> - Failing test gates are outside the round budget: never escalate them for budget or no-progress, never let them buy the extension, and keep fixing and re-running until the tests pass — never forcing green
> - Persist completed rounds, repeated blockers, findings and the explicit minimum in the owning run's `review-policy.cjs` record. Resume that record after interruption; target changes invalidate evidence and acceptance but preserve the bounded round budget. In-flight attempt IDs may be session-local; they do not replace or reset completed-round state
> - Final verdict must incorporate ALL rounds executed
>
> **Report must include `## Round N Findings (Fresh Sub-Agent)` for every round N≥2 that was executed, plus `## Deferred LOW Findings (severity floor, round ≥2)` whenever the loop ended on the severity floor with LOWs still open. When round 3 ran, the report must name the CRITICAL/HIGH findings that granted the extension; when rounds continued on failing tests, it must name the failing test gates of each such round.**

<!-- SYNC:fresh-context-review -->

> **Fresh Context Re-Review** — Eliminate orchestrator confirmation bias after fixes by restarting the full review with isolated sub-agents where applicable. A report-only/read-only reviewer never edits source, generated output, or user data: it validates and records the finding/repair handoff, then returns to the caller, which owns the fix and any re-review.
>
> **Why:** The main agent knows what it (or `/feature-implement`) just fixed and rationalizes findings accordingly. A fresh sub-agent has ZERO memory, re-reads from scratch, and catches what the main agent dismissed. Sub-agent bias is mitigated by (1) fresh context, (2) verbatim protocol injection, (3) main agent not filtering the report.
>
> **When:** After a validated-finding fix cycle, or to satisfy an explicitly declared independent-pass `minRounds`. A review round that finds zero issues ENDS the loop once that persisted minimum is met — do NOT invent a confirmation sub-agent. A review round that finds issues triggers: validate findings → fix → full review restart from the first phase.
>
> **How:**
>
> 1. Start a NEW full review invocation/task breakdown; when that protocol calls for agents, spawn NEW `Agent` tool calls — use `code-reviewer` subagent_type for code reviews, `general-purpose` for plan/doc/artifact reviews
> 2. Inject ALL required review protocols VERBATIM into the prompt — see `SYNC:review-protocol-injection` for the full list and template. Never reference protocols by file path; AI compliance drops behind file-read indirection (see `SYNC:shared-protocol-duplication-policy`)
> 3. Sub-agent re-reads ALL target files from scratch via its own tool calls — never pass file contents inline in the prompt
> 4. Sub-agent writes structured report to `tmp/reports/{review-type}-round{N}-{date}.md`
> 5. Main agent reads the report, integrates findings into its own report, DOES NOT override or filter
>
> **Rules:**
>
> - SKIP fresh sub-agent when the prior full review found zero issues AND the persisted `minRounds` is met (no fixes or required independent pass = nothing new to verify)
> - NEVER skip the full review restart after a fix cycle — every fix invalidates the prior verdict
> - NEVER reuse a sub-agent across rounds — every fresh round spawns a NEW `Agent` call
> - Continue until a complete full review pass clears that round's exit bar per `SYNC:double-round-trip-review`: **round 1** → zero findings at any severity; **round 2 (and the conditional round 3)** → zero CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM, so a round whose validated findings are ALL LOW ENDS the loop once the persisted minimum is met (list those LOWs as deferred instead of spawning another round). The budget is 2 rounds plus ONE extension to round 3, granted only when round 2 leaves a validated CRITICAL/HIGH open (a failed non-test binary gate counts as CRITICAL); round 3 is the review hard cap. A failing test gate is not budgeted — keep fixing and re-running until the tests pass. If the same validated blocker repeats across 2 full invocations with no progress, escalate via `AskUserQuestion`. **Read-only/report-only role boundary:** when this block is carried by a security auditor or another report-only role, “fix” means return the validated repair proposal to the parent; do not modify source, generated carriers, or user data and do not restart the review locally.
> - Persist completed rounds, repeated blockers, findings and the explicit minimum in the owning run's `review-policy.cjs` record. Resume that record after interruption; target changes invalidate evidence and acceptance but preserve the bounded round budget. In-flight attempt IDs may be session-local; they do not replace or reset completed-round state

> **Review Protocol Injection** — Every fresh sub-agent review prompt MUST embed 11 protocol blocks VERBATIM, copied WHOLESALE and unmodified. They are the review-tier renderings of their canonical `SYNC:` tags, not literal copies; when a canonical protocol changes, update the matching body here in the same edit. Copy the template wholesale into the Agent call's `prompt` field at runtime, replacing only the `{placeholders}` in Task / Round / Reference Docs / Target Files / Output sections with context-specific values. Do NOT touch the embedded protocol sections.

### Subagent Type Selection

- `code-reviewer` — for code reviews (reviewing source files, git diffs, implementation)
- `general-purpose` — for plan / doc / artifact reviews (reviewing markdown plans, docs, specs)

### Canonical Agent Call Template (Copy Verbatim)

```
Agent({
  description: "Fresh Round {N} review",
  subagent_type: "code-reviewer",
  prompt: `
## Task
{review-specific task — e.g., "Review all uncommitted changes for code quality" | "Review plan files under {plan-dir}" | "Review integration tests in {path}"}

## Round
Round {N}. You have ZERO memory of prior rounds. Re-read all target files from scratch via your own tool calls. Do NOT trust anything from the main agent beyond this prompt.

## Protocols (follow VERBATIM — these are non-negotiable)

### Spec ↔ Tests ↔ Code Triangulation
DO THIS FIRST — before any per-protocol check below. The review target is the WHOLE PACKAGE, not the diff alone. Read `docs/project-config.json` and resolve `specArtifacts`: a valid profile selects its configured `intent/contracts/evidence` section roles, identifiers, ownership rule, and test-carrier dialects; only an absent profile selects the strict-default business-spec shape (§3 ACs / §4 BRs / §5 invariants / §8 TCs). A malformed or unsupported declaration is `BLOCKED`; never treat it as absent or fall back. Load the governing artifact, its tests, and the changed code TOGETHER, and reason about their mutual consistency BEFORE judging any one in isolation.
1. Locate all three faces: the canonical owner section(s), the tests that guard them, and the production code that implements them. With a native profile, preserve owner path + case/scenario ID + optional variant and resolve each through its configured carrier to the actual test. A missing face is itself a finding (SPEC-GAP / TEST-GAP / DEAD-SPEC).
2. Triangulate pairwise — every disagreement is a finding; classify which face is wrong:
   - code vs spec: behavior the code does that no configured `intent/contracts` rule (or strict-default §3/§4/§5/§8 rule) describes → CODE-EXTRA or SPEC-STALE; a hard contract/invariant with no enforcing path → CODE-WRONG.
   - tests vs spec: a configured native case with no executing assertion, or a test asserting behavior no native rule/case names → TEST-GAP or SPEC-SILENT. Without `specArtifacts`, check strict-default §8 TCs.
   - tests vs code: a changed code path with no covering test → TEST-GAP; a test that still passes against a deliberately broken invariant → WEAK-TEST (apply the mutation thinking in Bug Detection).
3. Hidden-rule capture: any invariant the code enforces but the spec never states (SPEC-SILENT) MUST be surfaced as a finding, added to the profile's configured `intent` or `contracts` section, and linked from its `evidence` section to a native case whose executing assertion is inspected. Without a profile, use strict-default §3/§4/§5/§8 and TC. This is the enrichment loop, never a silent pass.
4. Only after the three faces agree — or every disagreement is logged as a finding — proceed to the per-protocol checks below; when enrichment adds spec/test content, re-review the package against the enriched spec.
NEVER mark review PASS while any spec/test/code face disagrees without a logged finding. The diff is the entry point; the package is the unit of judgment.

### Evidence-Based Reasoning
Speculation is FORBIDDEN. Every claim needs proof.
1. Cite file:line, grep results, or framework docs for EVERY claim
2. Declare confidence: >80% act freely, 60-80% verify first, <60% DO NOT recommend
3. Cross-service validation required for architectural changes
4. "I don't have enough evidence" is valid and expected output
BLOCKED until: Evidence file path (file:line) provided; Grep search performed; 3+ similar patterns found; Confidence level stated.
Forbidden without proof: "obviously", "I think", "should be", "probably", "this is because".
If incomplete → output: "Insufficient evidence. Verified: [...]. Not verified: [...]."

### Bug Detection
MUST check categories 1-4 for EVERY review. Never skip.
1. Null Safety: Can params/returns be null? Are they guarded? Optional chaining gaps? .find() returns checked?
2. Boundary Conditions: Off-by-one (< vs <=)? Empty collections handled? Zero/negative values? Max limits?
3. Error Handling: Try-catch scope correct? Silent swallowed exceptions? Error types specific? Cleanup in finally?
4. Resource Management: Connections/streams closed? Subscriptions unsubscribed on destroy? Timers cleared? Memory bounded?
5. Concurrency (if async): Missing await? Race conditions on shared state? Stale closures? Retry storms?
6. Stack-Specific: Check the configured language/runtime pitfalls and framework-specific failure modes discovered from local code.
Classify every finding by consequence (never by effort): CRITICAL = immediate material security/safety/data-loss risk or failed binary gate → block; HIGH = material correctness, contract, privacy, or authority risk → must fix; MEDIUM = bounded consequential edge/resilience/maintainability gap → must clear the current round, or escalate with an explicit residual-risk follow-up that does not create a clean pass; LOW = non-blocking polish with no credible present impact → record/defer from round 2; `NOT VERIFIABLE` is unresolved evidence, not LOW.

### Design Patterns Quality
Priority checks for every code change:
1. Consistency and reuse: follow documented local patterns; extract a shared abstraction only when repetition or a demonstrated consumer need justifies its cost. Similar names alone do not require a shared base class.
2. Responsibility: follow the architecture established by project configuration, references, accepted decisions, and existing code. Place behavior with its actual owner; do not presume an entity/service/controller hierarchy or forbid a layer without project evidence.
3. Apply cohesion, coupling, and dependency-management principles when their assumptions fit the project's paradigm. SOLID is useful for object-oriented boundaries, not a mandatory checklist for every language or codebase.
4. After extraction/move/rename: Grep ENTIRE scope for dangling references. Zero tolerance.
5. YAGNI gate: Treat repeated patterns as evidence to evaluate extraction, not a numeric threshold. Extract when a shared reason to change, real consumers, or an evidenced ownership/substitution boundary lowers total change cost; do not create patterns for hypothetical future use.
6. Purpose-oriented naming: Name public or cross-layer abstractions by the capability, domain purpose, or contract consumers rely on—not the current provider, SDK, framework, database, or transport. `IStorage`/`Storage` → `AzureBlobStorage`; use `IAzureStorage` only when Azure-specific semantics are intentionally part of the contract.
7. Contract-fit check: Read callers and every implementation before judging a name; narrow an over-broad abstraction (`IObjectStore`, `DocumentStore`) instead of rewarding a generic name that lies about behavior.
8. Mechanism/generic-name smell: Treat `Manager`, `Helper`, `Utils`, `Data`, `Thing`, `Service`, `Interface`, type decorations, and unexplained abbreviations as review signals—not automatic defects; flag them only when they hide purpose, scope, or responsibility.
9. Concrete implementation names: Provider, strategy, transport, or test-double names are valid on concrete types when they distinguish real behavior (`AzureBlobStorage`, `InMemoryStorage`, `RetryingStorage`); keep those details out of the caller-facing contract unless the contract promises them.
10. Language convention: Preserve local interface syntax and naming style; `.NET` `I` prefixes and Google TypeScript's unmarked interfaces are both valid local conventions.
Anti-patterns to flag: God Object, Copy-Paste inheritance, Circular Dependency, Leaky Abstraction.

### Logic & Intention Review
Verify WHAT code does matches WHY it was changed.
1. Change Intention Check: Every changed file MUST serve the stated purpose. Flag unrelated changes as scope creep.
2. Happy Path Trace: Walk through one complete success scenario through changed code.
3. Error Path Trace: Walk through one failure/edge case scenario through changed code.
4. Acceptance Mapping: If plan context available, map every acceptance criterion to a code change.
5. Tests Verify Intent: For test/spec changes, verify tests name the protected business rule or invariant and would fail if that intent breaks.
6. Migration Test Exclusion: Do not write tests for migration code. Schema/data migrations are one-time execution paths, not core application logic.
NEVER mark review PASS without completing both traces (happy + error path).

### Test Spec Verification
Map changed code to test specifications.
1. Identify the project's test/spec format from existing docs, test-case files, BDD feature files, or spec folders.
2. Every changed code path MUST map to a corresponding test case/spec (or flag as "needs test case").
3. New functions/endpoints/handlers → flag for test spec creation.
4. Migration files are excluded from test/spec creation; schema/data migrations are one-time execution paths, not core application logic.
5. If spec evidence fields exist, verify they point to actual code (file:line, not stale references).
6. Verify each meaningful test case names the business intent/invariant; flag behavior-only cases that only mirror implementation details.
7. Auth/data changes → verify corresponding authorization and data-state test cases exist.
8. If no specs exist for a changed path → log the gap and recommend the project's test-spec workflow.
NEVER skip test mapping. Untested code paths are the #1 source of production bugs.

### Behavioral Delta Matrix
MANDATORY for any bugfix review. Produce input-state × pre-fix × post-fix × delta table BEFORE writing verdict.
- Minimum 3 rows; include at least one row OUTSIDE the original bug report.
- Any "REGRESSION" delta → review returns FAIL until a preservation test is added.
- Narrative descriptions do NOT substitute for the matrix.
Example rows (external-record sync fix):
| Input                 | Pre-fix | Post-fix                  | Delta      |
| --------------------- | ------- | ------------------------- | ---------- |
| Record exists (valid) | Reused  | Always recreated → orphan | REGRESSION |
| Record missing (404)  | Error   | Recreated                 | Fixed      |

### Fix-Layer Accountability
Do not assume the crash site owns the defect. Trace the actual execution and data flow, then fix the component that owns the violated contract.
MANDATORY before ANY fix:
1. Trace the affected path — map the real origin, transformations, boundaries, and observed failure in the surfaces this project uses. Do not invent absent layers.
2. Identify the contract owner — use project architecture and code evidence to find which component is responsible for the invalid state or behavior.
3. Choose the correction point — fix the authoritative owner and retain any validation required at untrusted boundaries. A multi-file correction can be valid; justify it by the contracts each file owns rather than a file-count threshold.
4. Check bypass paths — inspect relevant constructors, adapters, parsers, caches, persistence, or other entry points that actually exist in the affected flow.
BLOCKED until: The affected path is traced; the owner is supported by file:line evidence; relevant consumers and bypass paths are checked; and the correction point fits the project's architecture.
Anti-patterns (REJECT): assuming the symptom site is the owner; scattering workarounds without tracing the contract; assuming the lowest technical layer is always authoritative; removing validation from a real trust boundary to force a single correction point.

### Rationalization Prevention
AI skips steps via these evasions. Recognize and reject:
- "Too simple for a plan" → Simple + wrong assumptions = wasted time. Plan anyway.
- "I'll test after" → RED before GREEN. Write/verify test first.
- "Already searched" → Show grep evidence with file:line. No proof = no search.
- "Just do it" → Still need TaskCreate. Skip depth, never skip tracking.
- "Just a small fix" → Small fix in wrong location cascades. Verify file:line first.
- "Code is self-explanatory" → Future readers need evidence trail. Document anyway.
- "Combine steps to save time" → Combined steps dilute focus. Each step has distinct purpose.

### Graph-Assisted Investigation
MANDATORY when .code-graph/graph.db exists.
HARD-GATE: MUST run at least ONE graph command on key files before concluding any investigation.
Pattern: Grep finds files → trace --direction both reveals full system flow → Grep verifies details.
- Investigation: trace --direction both on 2-3 entry files
- Fix/Debug: callers_of on buggy function + tests_for
- Feature/Enhancement: connections on files to be modified
- Code Review: tests_for on changed functions
- Blast Radius: trace --direction downstream
CLI: python .claude/scripts/code_graph {command} --json. Use --node-mode file first (10-30x less noise), then --node-mode function for detail.

### Understand Code First
HARD-GATE: Do NOT write, plan, or fix until you READ existing code.
1. Search 3+ similar patterns (grep/glob) — cite file:line evidence.
2. Read existing files in target area — understand structure, base classes, conventions.
3. Run python .claude/scripts/code_graph trace <file> --direction both --json when .code-graph/graph.db exists.
4. Map dependencies via connections or callers_of — know what depends on your target.
5. Write investigation to tmp/analysis/ for non-trivial tasks (3+ files).
6. Re-read analysis file before implementing — never work from memory alone.
7. NEVER invent new patterns when existing ones work — match exactly or document deviation.
BLOCKED until: Read target files; Grep 3+ patterns; Graph trace (if graph.db exists); Assumptions verified with evidence.

- `.claude/docs/development-rules.md` — canonical development rules, code-quality guidelines, and pre-commit checklist
- `code-review-rules.md`, inside the reference-docs root (default `docs/project-reference`; a `docsRoots.projectReference.path` entry in `docs/project-config.json` overrides the path)
- {skill-specific reference docs — e.g., integration-test-reference.md for integration-test-review; backend-patterns-reference.md for backend reviews; frontend-patterns-reference.md for frontend reviews}

## Target Files
{explicit file list OR "run git diff to see uncommitted changes" OR "read all files under {plan-dir}"}

## Output
Write a structured report to tmp/reports/{review-type}-round{N}-{date}.md with sections:
- Status: PASS | FAIL
- Issue Count: {number}
- Critical Issues (with file:line evidence)
- High Priority Issues (with file:line evidence)
- Medium / Low Issues
- Cross-cutting findings

Return the report path and status to the main agent.
Every finding MUST have file:line evidence. Speculation is forbidden.

### Rules

- DO copy the template wholesale — including all 11 embedded protocol sections
- DO replace only the `{placeholders}` in Task / Round / Reference Docs / Target Files / Output sections with context-specific content
- DO choose `code-reviewer` subagent_type for code reviews and `general-purpose` for plan / doc / artifact reviews
- DO NOT paraphrase, summarize, or skip any protocol section
- DO NOT pass file contents inline — the sub-agent reads via its own tool calls so it has a fresh context
- DO NOT reference protocols by file path or tag name — the bodies are already embedded above
- DO NOT introduce placeholder markers for the protocols — they must stay literally expanded

> **AI Mistake Prevention** — Failure modes to avoid on every task:
>
> **Project applicability gate.** Before applying a stack, layer, style, tool, or architecture rule, read the project's config and relevant references, then check local implementations. Treat framework examples as examples; honor explicit N/A and do not require a technology or convention the project does not use.
> **ROOT-CAUSE GATE — INVESTIGATE FIRST.** Before applying any project-related correction, always use the project's root-cause investigation protocol and establish the cause; the failure site may be only a symptom.
> **FAILED-TEST GATE.** For any failed or unstable test, use the project's test-investigation protocol before editing source or tests; never change either side merely to force green.
> **Re-read files after context changes.** Context compaction, resume, or long-running work can make memory stale; verify current files before acting.
> **Verify generated content against source evidence.** AI hallucinates APIs, names, claims, and document facts. Check the relevant source before documenting or referencing.
> **Check downstream references before deleting or renaming.** Removing an artifact can stale docs, generated mirrors, configs, and callers; map references first.
> **Trace the full impact chain after edits.** Changing a definition can miss derived outputs and consumers. Follow the affected chain before declaring done.
> **Verify ALL affected outputs, not just the first.** One green check is not all green checks; validate every output surface the change can affect.
> **Assume existing values are intentional — ask WHY before changing OR flagging one as a defect.** Before changing or reporting a constant, limit, flag, cutoff, wording, or pattern, read nearby context and history, the CALLER's ordering, and 2+ sibling call sites of the same convention. A doc stating WHAT without WHY is missing rationale, not proof of a missing guard.
> **Surface ambiguity before acting — don't pick silently.** Multiple valid interpretations require an explicit question or stated assumption with risk.
> **Assert the outcome your system owns, not the intermediate state your infrastructure owns.** When verifying async work, assert the final business state — never the delivery/retry bookkeeping held in shared infrastructure that any co-running process can write. Such a check passes when run alone and flakes the moment anything else shares that infrastructure.
> **Store disposable generated output in the project workspace.** If an output can be regenerated and is not source code, a canonical source-of-truth, or an intentionally versioned projection, write it under the project-root `tmp/` or `temp/` directory (prefer `tmp/`), scoped to the run. This includes temporary state, integration/E2E results, reports, logs, screenshots, traces, videos, coverage, dumps, and candidate evidence. Never put these outputs in source, docs, the plans root (default `plans/`; a `docsRoots.plans.path` entry in `docs/project-config.json` overrides the path), the team-artifacts root (default `team-artifacts/`; `docsRoots.teamArtifacts.path` in the same config overrides the path), or mirror directories; the project-root `.gitignore` must ignore `/tmp/` and `/temp/` by default. Committed fixtures, accepted baselines, canonical specs/docs, and explicitly versioned generated mirrors remain at their declared owner paths.
> **Judge the environment before judging the code.** A bug report, failed test, error, or unexpected output is not proof of a code defect. Before and during adjudication, weigh environment causes as a competing hypothesis — setup, config, version and dependency state, service dependencies, stale artifacts or leftover state, and transient resource pressure (RAM, CPU, disk, handles, network). State the discriminator you ran; fix an environment cause in the environment, never by editing product code or weakening a test to absorb it.
> **Keep shared guidance role-relevant.** Universal guidance must help every receiving skill or agent; code-specific obligations belong only in code-specific protocols.

> 2. **Navigation Map** — how a user moves between views: entry points, transitions, and exits. Trace how this surface connects to neighboring features already in the system.
> 3. **Key observable states** — the distinct states a user can observe per view (empty, loading, populated, error, success, permission-denied, etc.) — described as what the user perceives, not how it is rendered.
> 4. **Per-story action flows** — for each user story, the step-by-step click/action path from intent to outcome, cross-referenced to the logical IDs the configured profile owns.
> 5. **Couple to the companion design artifact** — keep deep visual fidelity (layout, tokens, pixel detail) OUT of the spec; it lives in the linked companion design artifact. Record that artifact's path in the spec frontmatter so the spec stays the navigable hub.

<!-- SYNC:severity-rubric -->

> **Severity Rubric** — Classify every finding by consequence, not by effort, reviewer preference, or how annoying the fix is. One scale applies to every review, skill, agent, workflow, and host so a tier has the same meaning everywhere. Choose the highest credible consequence supported by evidence; do not lower a tier to make a round pass.
>
> **Finding vs observation (required):** An observation becomes a finding only when it names the affected user/system/data/contract, the shipped consequence, the evidence location, and the normalized tier. `INFO`, advice, preference, duplicate wording, or an unsubstantiated concern is not a finding and must not reopen a loop. If the concern might affect a required behavior or gate but evidence is incomplete, emit `NOT VERIFIABLE` with the missing evidence and keep it unresolved; never silently convert uncertainty into LOW.
>
> | Severity | Action | Definition and examples |
> | --- | --- | --- |
> | CRITICAL | Block immediately; escalate | Immediate material risk if shipped: authentication/authorization or safety bypass; secrets/PII exposure; irreversible destructive action; data loss/corruption; or a silent failure on a critical path. A failed binary gate that makes the result untrustworthy is represented as a separate synthetic blocker by the executable policy (not as an ordinary severity judgment). |
> | HIGH | Must fix before PASS/merge | Material correctness or contract risk: wrong behavior on a supported path; violated business/data invariant; meaningful privacy or authority gap; breaking API/schema/compatibility change; likely harm to users/downstream systems; or a missing proof for a behavior-changing fix. |
> | MEDIUM | Must clear the current round; escalate if the fix needs an owner decision | Bounded but consequential risk: an edge case, resilience/observability/testability/maintainability gap, credible future defect, or local architectural drift whose impact is real but not immediate material loss. An explicit follow-up records the escalation/residual risk; it does not make an open MEDIUM a clean pass. |
> | LOW | Record and defer; never open another fix/re-review round from round 2 onward, and never counts toward the round-3 extension | Non-blocking polish with no credible present correctness, security, privacy, authority, availability, or data-integrity impact: wording/formatting, minor documentation or convention drift, optional defensive cleanup, or a cosmetic/refinement suggestion. |
>
> **Consequence decision tree (apply in order):** (1) Is a binary gate failed? Keep it as a separate hard blocker (the executable helper represents it as synthetic CRITICAL); do not use the ordinary severity label to hide what failed. Otherwise, would shipping permit immediate material security/safety/authority harm, irreversible destruction, data loss/corruption, or a critical-path silent failure? → **CRITICAL**. (2) Otherwise, does a supported path, invariant, public contract, privacy/authority boundary, compatibility promise, or behavior-changing proof fail with material user/downstream impact? → **HIGH**. (3) Otherwise, is there a bounded but consequential edge, resilience, observability, testability, maintainability, or architectural gap with a credible impact? → **MEDIUM**. (4) Otherwise, is the evidence sufficient to show only non-blocking polish with no credible present material impact? → **LOW**. (5) If the evidence needed to choose between steps 1–4 is missing, → **NOT VERIFIABLE**, not LOW. When multiple tiers fit, select the highest credible consequence; effort, implementation cost, reviewer discomfort, frequency alone, proximity to the round cap, and whether a tier would unlock or forfeit the conditional round-3 extension never decide the tier.
>
> **Boundary examples (normalize before applying the round predicate):** an auth bypass, exposed secret/PII, destructive command without an authority gate, or failed required test/generation/parity gate is **CRITICAL**; a wrong supported response, broken invariant/API/schema, meaningful privacy/authority defect, or unproven behavior-changing fix is **HIGH**; a bounded retry/timeout/alert/testability gap or credible maintainability drift is **MEDIUM**; a typo, formatting inconsistency, optional cleanup, or cosmetic suggestion proven not to affect present behavior is **LOW**. A missing fact about any of those boundaries is **NOT VERIFIABLE** until evidence or an explicitly documented residual-risk decision exists.
>
> **Classification procedure (required for every finding):** (1) state the affected user, system, data, contract, or gate; (2) assess consequence if the issue ships; (3) assess exposure/likelihood and reversibility/detectability; (4) select the highest tier justified by those facts; (5) cite `file:line` or equivalent evidence and a confidence percentage. Effort, implementation cost, reviewer discomfort, and proximity to the round cap are never severity inputs. `NOT VERIFIABLE` is a pending evidence state, not one of the four tiers and never a LOW escape hatch: if the unresolved claim could affect required behavior, security, privacy, authority, availability, data integrity, or a binary gate, it remains an open evidence blocker until resolved or explicitly owner-accepted with documented residual risk. Classify an item LOW only when evidence supports the absence of credible present material impact.
>
> **Hard-gate rule:** Binary gates (tests, required artifacts, security must-fix checks, generated parity, policy compliance) are not ordinary severity-rated findings. The executable helper records a failed gate as a synthetic CRITICAL blocker solely so one predicate can carry it; the report must still name the gate and failure evidence. A failed gate blocks at every round, including when all ordinary findings are LOW; never disguise a failed gate as LOW. A failed non-test gate counts as CRITICAL for the round-3 extension; a failing test gate is outside the round budget and loops until the tests pass.
>
> **Score-based skills** map their numeric scale onto these tiers — do not invent a parallel vocabulary:
>
> - **0-2 criterion scoring** (e.g. production-readiness-review): `0` = CRITICAL/HIGH (criterion unmet, blocks readiness), `1` = MEDIUM (partial, consequential gap), `2` = pass (no finding). If the criterion is only polish, use LOW rather than forcing a `0`.
> - **Two-axis scoring** (e.g. performance-review, impact × likelihood): high impact + high exposure → CRITICAL/HIGH; material impact with bounded exposure → HIGH/MEDIUM; low impact and low exposure → LOW. Record the axes and why the selected tier is the highest credible consequence.
> - **Scorecards / `/20` grades** (e.g. architecture-scalability-review): the aggregate score and verdict band are separate from finding severity. A sub-80 area is evidence to investigate, not an automatic CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW label; classify each underlying gap by the consequence decision tree and keep advisory score deductions separate from blocking findings.
>
> **Domain-vocabulary normalization (mandatory):** Specialized skills may keep a local reporting vocabulary, but it MUST feed this same four-tier round predicate — never a second severity system:
>
> - `BLOCKED`, `HARD FAIL`, or `FAIL` is a blocking local verdict, not an automatic CRITICAL label. Classify the underlying consequence as CRITICAL when it is an immediate material risk or failed binary gate; otherwise classify it as HIGH or MEDIUM with evidence, while preserving the local block until the owning gate is satisfied.
> - `WARN` is not permission to ignore a finding. Map it to MEDIUM when the gap is consequential, to LOW only when evidence supports no credible present material impact, or upward to HIGH/CRITICAL when the consequence warrants it. `PASS`/compliant is not a finding.
> - UI `P0`/`P1`/`P2`/`P3`/`P4` map to CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW/LOW respectively as a starting point; override upward only when the evidence shows a higher shipped consequence. A P0/P1 accessibility or task-completion floor remains a blocking gate even when a local UI report calls it a priority rather than a severity.
> - Numeric SRE/readiness or impact/likelihood scores are evidence inputs, not replacement tiers. Emit the score, the consequence, and the normalized CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW tier together. `INFO`/advisory observations are not findings unless the evidence shows a material consequence.
>
> A finding's tier drives the gate: CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM remain actionable and blocking under the round policy, and only an open CRITICAL/HIGH at round 2 (a failed non-test binary gate counts as CRITICAL) unlocks the single conditional extension round; LOW may be tracked as a follow-up and, from round 2, does not by itself justify another fix/re-review. An owner decision may explain or schedule an open MEDIUM but does not turn it into a clean pass; owner acceptance never makes a failed binary gate pass and must record scope, rationale, and residual risk.

> **Trade-Off Interrogation Gate** — ALWAYS ask these THREE questions before ANY verdict, score, finding, or recommendation — about the thing under review AND about every recommendation YOU make. — why: naming a benefit without its price is an endorsement, not a review; the costliest trade-offs are the ones nobody wrote down.
>
> 1. **Is there any trade-off?** Name what it SACRIFICES. "None" / "pure win" is an unfinished analysis, NOT an answer — to claim none, state which dimensions you checked and why each is unaffected: future change cost · complexity · performance/latency · memory/cost · coupling · reversibility · migration burden · operational load · blast radius · security posture · testability · team skill/ramp · delivery time · UX.
> 2. **Is it worth it?** Weigh gain against sacrifice EXPLICITLY — what is gained (with a metric) · what it costs · WHO pays · WHEN it comes due — then emit **WORTH IT / NOT WORTH IT / UNCLEAR**. "Better" with no metric and no cost FAILS this question. NOT WORTH IT → withdraw or replace the recommendation, never keep it as-is.
> 3. **Is the trade-off material enough to CONFIRM WITH THE USER?** A material trade-off is the user's call, never yours. **MATERIAL** when ANY holds: irreversible / one-way door (data migration, public contract, storage format, vendor lock-in) · cost shifted onto someone else (another team, ops/on-call, future maintainer, end user) · one quality attribute traded for another (correctness↔speed, security↔convenience, latency↔cost, simplicity↔flexibility) · a boundary crossed (client↔server tier, service contract, event contract, shared library) · a high-consequence path (auth, money, data integrity, breaking change, High/Medium residual risk) · the worth-it verdict is UNCLEAR.
>
> **MATERIAL → STOP and confirm via `AskUserQuestion` BEFORE the verdict stands** — state the trade-off, both options, what each sacrifices, and your recommendation. **NOT material →** record it inline with a one-line justification and proceed.
>
> **Non-asking execution contexts — ESCALATE BY HANDOFF, never by silence.** `AskUserQuestion` reaches only the main interactive agent: a sub-agent cannot ask the user, and a terminal/verdict-only mode asks nothing by design. When you are running in such a context, the obligation is **redirected, never waived** — do ALL of: (a) complete questions 1 and 2 normally; (b) decide materiality and record it in the Trade-Off Assessment row with `confirmed? = NO — cannot ask from this context`; (c) **name the unconfirmed MATERIAL trade-off explicitly in your returned summary/verdict so the CALLER (or parent orchestrator) escalates it via `AskUserQuestion` on your behalf** — a material trade-off mentioned only inside a report file on disk is NOT a handoff; (d) do not emit an unqualified PASS — mark the verdict as carrying an unconfirmed material trade-off, so the caller's gate stays closed until the user answers. The caller inherits the escalation duty the moment it reads your return.
>
> This carve-out is about **reachability, not convenience**: it applies ONLY where the tool genuinely cannot reach the user (spawned sub-agent, terminal validate/verdict-only mode, non-interactive/headless run). It is NEVER a licence to skip the question, to self-approve a one-way door, or to downgrade materiality because asking is inconvenient — if you CAN ask, you MUST ask.
>
> **Emit a Trade-Off Assessment row** per reviewed decision and per recommendation: `| decision | sacrifices | gain (metric) | who pays, when | WORTH IT/NOT/UNCLEAR | material? | confirmed? |`.

> **BLOCKED until:** trade-off named (or dimensions-checked justification given) · worth-it verdict emitted · materiality decided · every MATERIAL trade-off either confirmed with the user OR — in a non-asking context — handed off in the returned verdict for the caller to confirm. A MATERIAL trade-off that is neither confirmed nor handed off can NEVER be PASS, and NEVER gets buried as a Low-severity note.
>
> **NEVER** answer "no trade-off" without checking · decide a material trade-off silently on the user's behalf · let convergence/delivery pressure authorize walking through a one-way door · bundle several material trade-offs into one vague "proceed?".

> - `UI-1.2` Signal order: size → weight → colour → position. Use the cheapest signal that works before adding another.
> - `UI-1.3` Group by proximity, NEVER by border. Whitespace separates cleanly; boxes inside boxes do not.
> - `UI-1.4` Align to a shared edge. Every unexplained indent reads as an accident.
> - `UI-1.5` Design the empty, loading and error state FIRST. The full state is the easy one.
>
> **2.0 Typography**
>
> - `UI-2.1` Keep type families and weights purposeful; follow the project's type system when present. Two families and three weights are one possible web starting point, not a limit.
> - `UI-2.2` Meet the readable-text sizes required by the applicable platform and project. Common web/mobile values such as 16px are examples; do not use them as universal minimums.
> - `UI-2.3` Keep text measures readable for the content and target surface. A 45–75 character line is an editorial heuristic, not a pass threshold.
> - `UI-2.4` Choose line spacing that supports the font, size, script, and reading context; ratios such as 1.5 for body text are starting points.
> - `UI-2.5` Use the project's type scale where defined. Otherwise keep sizes purposeful and consistent without requiring a fixed number of named steps.
>
> **3.0 Colour & Contrast**
>
> - `UI-3.1` Meet the contrast ratios required by the selected accessibility standard; for web, use WCAG 2.2 AA unless a stricter applicable legal or project requirement applies. Measure where possible. Ratios such as 4.5:1 for text and 3:1 for interface parts are standard-specific examples, not universal values.
> - `UI-3.2` One accent, one job. An accent that is everywhere points at nothing.
> - `UI-3.3` Colour NEVER carries meaning alone — pair it with an icon, label or position.
> - `UI-3.4` Dark mode is NOT inverted light mode. Lift surfaces to signal elevation; soften pure-white text.
>
> **4.0 Spacing & Grid**
>
> - `UI-4.1` Follow the project's spacing tokens or grid when defined. A 4px or 8px base is one common option, not a framework requirement.
> - `UI-4.2` Space belongs to the container, not the child. Use `gap`; reserve margins for exceptions.
> - `UI-4.3` Use spacing to make grouping and hierarchy clear; the right relationship depends on the content and layout.
> - `UI-4.4` Breakpoints follow content, not devices. Break where the layout stops working.
>
> **5.0 Interaction & Feedback**
>
> - `UI-5.1` Give immediate, perceivable feedback; use a timing target only when the product contract or applicable platform guidance defines one.
> - `UI-5.2` Specify the interaction states supported by the target platform and input modes (for example default, focus, active, disabled, or loading); hover is not universal.
> - `UI-5.3` Prefer undo over confirmation. Confirm ONLY what cannot be reversed.
> - `UI-5.4` Use motion when it clarifies cause and effect; follow project/platform timing and easing, and honor reduced-motion preferences when supported. Durations around 150–250ms are examples, not a rule.
> - `UI-5.5` Preserve a perceivable focus indicator wherever the interface supports focus navigation; follow the platform and applicable accessibility standard.
>
> **6.0 Navigation & IA**
>
> - `UI-6.1` Every screen answers: where am I, what's here, where next.
> - `UI-6.2` Keep primary navigation understandable for the product's information architecture; do not impose a fixed destination count.
> - `UI-6.3` Label by the user's word, not the internal one. Team vocabulary is not a taxonomy.
> - `UI-6.4` Preserve expected return, history, or deep-link behavior where the platform and product provide those concepts.
>
> **7.0 Forms & Input**
>
> - `UI-7.1` Ask for less. Every field needs a reason it exists today.
> - `UI-7.2` Labels stay visible. Placeholders are hints, NEVER labels.
> - `UI-7.3` Validate at a point that supports timely, useful correction without disrupting entry; follow the project's interaction contract. Explain errors and associate them with the affected input where supported.
> - `UI-7.4` Match the input control and available input aids to the data and target platform; use autocomplete or capitalization hints only where supported and appropriate.
> - `UI-7.5` NEVER lose entered data. Preserve input across errors, navigation and refresh.
>
> **8.0 Mobile & Touch** _(mobile/touch surfaces)_
>
> - `UI-8.1` Meet the target-size and spacing requirements of the applicable platform/accessibility standard. The interactive target may exceed the visible icon.
> - `UI-8.2` Place primary actions where they are reachable for the target device, orientation, handedness, and input mode.
> - `UI-8.3` Provide an alternative to gesture-only actions when required by the target platform or accessibility contract.
> - `UI-8.4` Respect safe areas and the keyboard. Notch, home indicator and on-screen keyboard all steal space.
>
> **9.0 Speed & Perceived Speed**
>
> - `UI-9.1` Give feedback appropriate to the work and what is known; skeletons and spinners are options, not required patterns.
> - `UI-9.2` Use optimistic updates only when the operation can be safely reconciled; otherwise show clear pending, success, and failure states.
> - `UI-9.3` Reserve space for anything that loads. Images, ads and fonts must NEVER shift the layout.

> **Precedence (resolve in this order, never silently):** the **brief's own stated visual direction WINS outright** — including when it asks for one of the `DD-4` tells. Then the **project's design-system / SCSS / frontend-pattern docs and accepted ADRs** — a house style IS an intentional identity, and re-deciding it per feature is the incoherence this gate prevents. Then these clauses. A genuine conflict is SURFACED to the user with both sides, NEVER resolved silently.
>
> **Relationship to `UI-1.1`–`UI-9.4`:** a different question, no overlap — the 40 clauses ask _"is this usable, accessible, consistent?"_ (a measurable floor); this gate asks _"is this THIS product's interface, or the one any generator would emit for any brief?"_. A surface can pass all 40 clauses and still be a template. BOTH bind; where they touch (type scale, colour, motion timing) the clause sets the floor and this gate picks the value.
>
> - `DD-1` **Ground it in the subject matter.** Before designing, name the concrete subject, the audience, and the design's primary job — and CONFIRM with the user when the brief is silent. Distinctive choices come FROM the subject's industry, materials and vernacular; they are never taste applied on top. **Test: if the palette, type and layout would fit a different product unchanged, there is no identity yet.**
> - `DD-2` **Every choice carries a WHY.** "It's common", "it's clean", "users expect it" are not reasons. A decision with no articulable reason is a default that arrived unnoticed. Defaults hide in what feels like infrastructure — typography, navigation, data display, and TOKEN NAMES. **Token-name test: someone reading only your CSS variables should be able to guess what product this is** (`--ink`/`--parchment` evoke a world; `--gray-700`/`--surface-2` evoke a template).
> - `DD-3` **Two passes, and the review pass is mandatory.** (1a) Write a compact **design plan** — Colour (4–6 named hex values) · Type (families + roles + scale) · Layout (one-sentence prose + ASCII wireframes to compare alternatives, including alignment: left/centre/justified) · Principles (what makes THIS page unique). (1b) **BLOCKING generic test — before any code:** work through a similar prompt and see whether you arrive somewhere similar; **any part that reads like the generic default for any comparable page rather than a choice for THIS brief gets REVISED, and you state what you changed and why.** Then (2a) build the REVISED plan, (2b) critique. — why: writing a plan and going straight to code reproduces the default, because the plan came from the same patterns the code will.
> - `DD-4` **Audit every FREE axis against the generated-design tell catalog** (`[model-knowledge]`, calibration not prohibition — each trait is legitimate for SOME brief): **T1** cream `#F4F1EA` + high-contrast serif + terracotta near `#D97757` (Anthropic's own interaction accent — on a user's brief it reads specifically as a tell) · **T2** near-black + one acid-green/vermilion accent · **T3** broadsheet hairline-rule pastiche, zero radius, dense columns · **T4** the SaaS-card kit: identical rounded cards, ONE radius regardless of hierarchy, the same `rgba(0,0,0,.1)` shadow under each, gradient washes as decoration · **T5** template chrome whatever the subject: tracked-out ALL-CAPS eyebrow above every heading, meta strings joined with middle dots (`A · B · C`), `WORD — fragment` labels with a spaced em dash, tinted near-black (`#0B0B0B`/`#111`) standing in for black, monospace for small data labels, `→` appended to link/button text. **A match is a HYPOTHESIS about a missed decision, never a defect** — promote it only by naming the axis, that the brief left it free, and what the subject suggested instead.
> - `DD-5` **Typography carries the personality.** One family, or two CLEARLY distinct ones — you do NOT need separate display and body faces. Choose deliberately, not the default you would reach for on any project. Set a real scale with intentional weights, widths and spacing. When type is a headline it is an ACTIVE part of the design, not a neutral delivery vehicle. Measure under ~80 characters; serifs tolerate slightly longer lines and want slightly more line-height than sans at the same size. Hierarchy needs weight/tracking/opacity, not size alone. **Avoid the three commonest tells: accenting a single word in a headline (italic/bold/colour) · ALL CAPS labels · an eyebrow label that names the section the heading already names.**
> - `DD-6` **Structure is information, not decoration.** Outlines, borders, numbering, eyebrows, dividers and labels must encode something about the content. **Before adding numbered markers (`01 / 02 / 03`), check the content really IS a sequence** — a stepped process, timeline or ranking. For every device ask: what does this tell the reader that whitespace would not? Nothing → cut it. **Hero:** open with the most characteristic thing in the subject's world, in whatever form fits (headline, image, animation, live demo, interactive moment) — big-number-plus-small-label-plus-gradient is the DEFAULT treatment, so use it only when it is genuinely best here. **Composition:** rhythm over monotone (same card size, same gap, same density everywhere is the sound of no one deciding); proportions must say something you can articulate; one dominant focal point.
> - `DD-7` **Motion sparingly and deliberately.** Non-user-triggered motion draws attention ONLY. One orchestrated moment — a single page-load sequence or one reveal — lands better than scattered effects; **fade-and-slide-up entrances on each section and hover transitions on every card are the generic default and read as generated.** Motion that ANSWERS a person's action (opening, expanding, confirming) is welcome when it shows what changed. Honour `prefers-reduced-motion`.
> - `DD-8` **Spend boldness once, then remove one accessory.** Let ONE element be the memorable thing and keep everything around it quiet and disciplined; cut any decoration that does not serve the brief. **Critique the BUILT page, not just the plan** — composition, craft (density is a decision, not a constant), content coherence, and CSS honesty (negative margins undoing a parent's padding, `calc()` values that exist only as workarounds, absolute positioning to escape layout flow are lies; the correct answer is always simpler than the hack). Take screenshots to review where the environment supports it — a picture is worth 1000 tokens. Then ask "if they said this lacks craft, what would they point to?" and fix that. **Build the quality floor in silently** — responsive, visible keyboard focus, reduced-motion respected, measured contrast, tokens never raw hex or magic numbers — and watch CSS selector specificity, where a type-based selector (`.section`) and an element-based one (`.cta`) most often cancel each other's padding/margin.
>
> **Memory:** vary between briefs — light and dark, families, direction. NEVER converge on the same choice across generations (Space Grotesk, for example). Where the project already has a design system, tokens, or an `interface-system.md`, ADOPT and record it rather than re-deciding; write back any pattern used 2+ times with measurements worth remembering.
>
> **Skip ONLY** when the change has NO user-facing visual surface (backend-only, tooling, docs) — state that reason explicitly so the skip is auditable, not an omission.

<!-- SYNC:design-review-checklist -->

> **Front-End Design Review Checklist** — the EXECUTABLE review protocol for any artifact carrying a user-facing front-end surface. Full catalog (`A1`…`Q`, ~130 checks with failure signals and default severities): **`.claude/docs/design-review-checklist.md`**. This gate carries the protocol and the triage pass; the file carries the checks.
>
> **Applies when — and ONLY when — the change, plan, or artifact carries a user-facing front-end surface.** A back-end-only diff, a doc edit, or a config change is `N/A`: state that once and move on. NEVER run a UI review on a non-UI change to manufacture coverage. When it DOES apply, **MUST ATTENTION READ `.claude/docs/design-review-checklist.md` and work its sections** — a review that cites a check ID without opening the catalog is asserting, not checking.
>
> **`CL-1` Context before checks (§0.1).** Establish platform · primary user & expertise · primary task · success metric · constraints · review scope · available artifacts. Fewer than four known → state the gap at the top of the report and mark affected findings **low confidence** — why: a check judged against an unknown task is a guess wearing an ID.
>
> **`CL-2` Evidence or nothing (§0.2).** Every finding cites a specific location (screen · element · `file:line`). NEVER invent a measurement — contrast, tap-target size, and load time that cannot be measured from the given artifact are `NOT VERIFIABLE`, never a guessed number. Tag every finding `MEASURED` · `OBSERVED` · `HEURISTIC`. Status values: `PASS` · `FAIL` · `PARTIAL` · `N/A` · `NOT VERIFIABLE`.
>
> **`CL-3` Severity, then a cap (§0.3).** `P0` blocks task completion / loses data / excludes a protected group (ship blocker) · `P1` significant friction or a legal accessibility floor (fix before release) · `P2` measurable inefficiency (next iteration) · `P3` polish (backlog) · `P4` note. Cap the report at the top 10 by severity unless a full audit was requested. A clean section reports "no issues found" — NEVER pad. Every `P0`/`P1` carries a concrete fix.
>
> **`CL-4` Section sweep, in order.** §A core usability heuristics · §B cognitive load & decision design · §C visual design & hierarchy · §D interaction and relevant product states · §E information architecture · **§F web / §G mobile / §H desktop — conditional on platform** · §I accessibility: use WCAG 2.2 AA as the web baseline and meet any stricter applicable legal or project requirement; for other platforms, use the documented platform standard. Record the selected standard and its source; severity follows the governing release contract · §J content & UX writing · §K trust, ethics & privacy · **§L AI & agentic patterns — conditional on the product having AI features** · §M cross-cutting consistency · §N edge-case probes. Make one focused pass per applicable section and record N/A with evidence for sections the surface does not support.
>
> **`CL-5` Quick Triage Pass (§P)** when a full sweep is not possible — use these prompts for applicable surfaces: (1) can a new user complete the primary task unaided · (2) is feedback timely against the project/platform expectation · (3) do relevant empty/loading/error states offer a forward path · (4) is the primary action obvious and reachable for supported inputs · (5) do contrast and focus meet the selected accessibility standard (WCAG 2.2 AA baseline for web) · (6) can users operate the surface with its supported input modes · (7) do interactive targets meet the platform's size/spacing guidance · (8) are destructive actions recoverable where appropriate · (9) does the surface work at its smallest supported size and required zoom/reflow · (10) are there deceptive or coercive patterns.
>
> **`CL-6` Report shape (§O).** Context (+ known gaps) → Verdict (Ship / Ship with fixes / Do not ship) → What works (2–4 specific strengths, cited) → Findings grouped `P0`→`P3`, each with Location · Evidence + tag · Impact · Principle (checklist ID) · Fix → Open questions → Coverage table. Any `P0` caps the grade at Fail regardless of score; report a score only ALONGSIDE findings, never instead of them.
>
> **Component architecture pass (§M6–§M9) when source code is in scope.** Verify the ownership model documented or demonstrated by the project, reuse/composition decisions, and whether shared behavior is duplicated without a reason. Do not require tiers, a base abstraction, or a particular test hierarchy unless the project uses one. Report applicable checklist IDs with `file:line` evidence; do not infer source architecture from a screenshot alone.
>
> **Precedence and no-double-counting.** The project's design-system / SCSS / frontend-pattern docs and accepted ADRs OUTRANK this checklist; the brief's stated direction outranks aesthetic judgment. A deliberate, documented convention is NEVER a defect — check intent before flagging, and surface a genuine conflict to the user with both sides, NEVER resolve it silently. This checklist is the review PROCEDURE, not a third set of taste rules: `UI-1.1`–`UI-9.4` ask "does it meet the usability floor?", `DD-1`–`DD-8` ask "is this THIS product's interface?", and these checks ask "did the review actually look, with evidence, and rank it?". Where a check restates a `UI-*` or `DD-*` clause, report the defect ONCE under whichever ID the consuming skill already uses.
>
> **For a PLAN or a PLAN REVIEW.** When the plan contains UI work, bind applicable acceptance criteria to the target platform/surface, relevant user states, and the selected accessibility standard. Use WCAG 2.2 AA as the web baseline and meet any stricter applicable legal or project requirement; for other platforms, identify the documented platform standard. Identify conditional sections (§F/§G/§H, §L) that apply. Do not require every catalogued state; record the standard and its source, and keep unsupported checks N/A.

**MUST ATTENTION** Check project config, relevant references, and local evidence before applying stack-specific conventions; honor explicit N/A. ROOT-CAUSE GATE: before any project-related correction, use the appropriate root-cause investigation protocol; failed/unstable tests require the test-investigation protocol before editing source/tests — never force green.

<!-- /SYNC:ai-mistake-prevention:reminder -->

<!-- SYNC:task-tracking-external-report:reminder -->

- **MANDATORY** Bootstrap task tracking before target work; transition one task at a time.
- **MANDATORY** Persist plan/review findings to `tmp/reports/` incrementally and synthesize from disk.

<!-- /SYNC:task-tracking-external-report:reminder -->

<!-- SYNC:project-reference-docs-guide:reminder -->

- **MANDATORY** Before project-specific work, load the OPTIONAL project-config (default `docs/project-config.json`) via its loader. No config is supported — fall back to portable defaults plus repository evidence, state material assumptions, never block. When present: require non-empty `project.name`, use neutral defaults/skips for omitted optional capabilities, and fail closed on a declared malformed section.
- **MANDATORY** Apply an explicit `referenceDocs` array exactly, including `[]`; when absent use only the capability-aware resolver output, which may be empty. Cite `Reference docs read: ...` and note the selected or empty set.
- **MANDATORY** Load detail JUST IN TIME, immediately before the first target read/grep/edit/test — a hook event or a prior turn is NEVER evidence that the current files were read. Re-resolve selection and re-read after compaction, resume, delegation, or a context change.
- **MANDATORY** The project-init-owned `lessons.md` and docs-index inputs are always-on at their configured owner paths, read independently of task-specific `referenceDocs`. A missing/stale root instruction file or required reference doc, or a malformed declared config section → auto-run `/project-init` (or the narrow lower-level route) before relying on that input. An absent config never gates work — offer `/project-init` or `/project-config` once. Project config and conventions override generic framework defaults.

<!-- /SYNC:project-reference-docs-guide:reminder -->

<!-- SYNC:nested-task-creation:reminder -->

- **MANDATORY** Parent workflow rows do not replace child phase tracking; expand phases and link the parent when nested.
- **MANDATORY** Orchestrators pre-expand child skill phases before invocation; use `[N.M] /skill-name — phase` prefixes and one-`in_progress` discipline.

<!-- /SYNC:nested-task-creation:reminder -->

<!-- SYNC:severity-rubric:reminder -->

- **MANDATORY** Classify every finding Critical/High/Medium/Low by consequence using the affected asset, shipped impact, exposure, reversibility, evidence location, and confidence; Critical/High/MEDIUM remain actionable under the round bar, while LOW is recorded/deferred from round 2 onward.
- **MANDATORY** Keep binary gates separate from severity: a failed test, security must-fix, required artifact, or parity check blocks at every round and is never relabeled LOW.
- **MANDATORY** Score-based skills (sre 0-2, perf two-axis) map onto the same four tiers — no parallel severity vocabulary.

<!-- SYNC:ui-intent-layer:reminder -->

- **MANDATORY** For UI-bearing specs, author/maintain the tech-agnostic interaction-surface layer (views + navigation map + observable states + user-action flows), resolving it through the configured profile's intent/evidence roles and logical IDs; an unresolved owner, role, ID, carrier, or link stays `UNKNOWN`/`BLOCKED`. **Strict portable fallback — only when neither config nor local references declares a native artifact contract:** trace each flow to the default `US-`/`OP-`/`BR-` IDs and record the companion artifact in the `design_spec:`/`mockup:` frontmatter keys.

<!-- PROMPT-ENHANCE:STEP-TASK-CLOSING:START -->

## Prompt-Enhance Closing Anchors

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** follow declared step order for this skill; NEVER skip, reorder, or merge steps without explicit user approval
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** for every step/sub-skill call: set `in_progress` before execution, set `completed` after execution
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** every skipped step MUST include explicit reason; every completed step MUST include concise evidence
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** if Task tools unavailable, maintain an equivalent step-by-step plan tracker with synchronized statuses

<!-- PROMPT-ENHANCE:STEP-TASK-CLOSING:END -->

<!-- SYNC:double-round-trip-review:reminder -->

- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** run the review loop (aka **Self-Review Convergence Loop**): review → validate findings → fix validated blocking findings → FULL re-review. Any newly produced output/judgment gets ≥1 self-review, and any new judgment ≥1 `/why-review --validate-findings` pass, before it is treated as final.
- **MANDATORY severity floor:** round 1 exits only on zero findings at any severity; from round 2 the bar is zero CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM, so a LOW-only round ENDS the loop once the persisted `minRounds` is met — list every deferred LOW in the report. NEVER re-tier a real CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM down to reach the exit, and NEVER apply the floor to a binary gate (test-green, security must-fix).
- **MANDATORY round cap of 2, extendable ONCE to round 3 — a ceiling, NEVER a target.** A clean pass ends the loop once the persisted `minRounds` is met (default 1; explicit 2 requires an independent pass). Round 2 ending with a validated CRITICAL/HIGH still open (a failed non-test binary gate counts as CRITICAL) grants exactly ONE extra round; round 2 ending with only MEDIUM/`NOT VERIFIABLE` open, or round 3 ending with any review blocker open → **STOP and escalate via `AskUserQuestion`**, never a silent PASS. The 2-repeated-no-progress blocker rule escalates earlier if it trips first. A failing TEST gate has NO round cap and buys no extension — keep fixing and re-running until tests pass, never forcing green.

<!-- /SYNC:double-round-trip-review:reminder -->




<!-- SYNC:goal-contract-satisfaction-loop:reminder -->

- **MANDATORY** Resolve the active Goal Contract BEFORE work (active plan `goal.md` → `<plans root>/goals/{YYMMDD-HHmm}-{slug}/goal.md`, plans root default `plans` and overridable via a `docsRoots.plans.path` entry in `docs/project-config.json` → create from current request) and read saved success criteria before editing.
- **MANDATORY** Append iteration evidence after execution; emit a Goal Satisfaction matrix (PASS/FAIL/BLOCKED) before reporting PASS; loop on validated FAIL; escalate repeated no-progress or blockers. NEVER store secrets in goal files.

<!-- /SYNC:goal-contract-satisfaction-loop:reminder -->

<!-- SYNC:trade-off-interrogation-gate:reminder -->

- **MANDATORY MUST ATTENTION ALWAYS ASK THE 3 TRADE-OFF QUESTIONS** — on the thing under review AND on every recommendation you make: (1) **what does it SACRIFICE?** name the dimensions checked (change cost · complexity · perf · coupling · reversibility · migration · ops load · blast radius · security · testability · delivery time · UX) — "none"/"pure win" is an unfinished analysis; (2) **is it worth it?** gain (with a metric) vs cost, WHO pays, WHEN → emit **WORTH IT / NOT WORTH IT / UNCLEAR**; NOT WORTH IT → withdraw or replace it; (3) **is it MATERIAL enough to confirm with the user?** irreversible/one-way door · cost shifted onto another team/ops/maintainer/user · one quality attribute traded for another · a tier/service/event/library boundary crossed · auth/money/data-integrity/breaking-change/High-or-Medium-risk path · verdict UNCLEAR → **STOP and confirm via `AskUserQuestion` BEFORE the verdict**.
- **MANDATORY** A MATERIAL trade-off with no user confirmation can NEVER be PASS; never bury one as a Low-severity note, never decide it silently, and never let delivery or convergence pressure authorize a one-way door — an un-walked-back one-way door is the user's call, not the reviewer's.
- **MANDATORY — a context that cannot ask escalates BY HANDOFF, never by silence.** `AskUserQuestion` reaches only the main interactive agent, so a sub-agent or a terminal/verdict-only mode cannot ask. There the duty is REDIRECTED, not waived: still name the trade-off, still decide materiality, record `confirmed? = NO — cannot ask from this context`, and **state the unconfirmed MATERIAL trade-off in your RETURNED verdict so the CALLER escalates it** (a note only in an on-disk report is not a handoff); never emit an unqualified PASS. If you CAN ask, you MUST ask.

<!-- /SYNC:trade-off-interrogation-gate:reminder -->

<!-- SYNC:parallel-subagent-dispatch -->

> **Parallel Sub-Agent Dispatch** — Plan parallelism the moment a task breakdown exists, BEFORE executing it — running provably independent tasks sequentially wastes wall-clock. Applies to every multi-step job: workflow steps, planning, batch updates, investigation, research, scans, reviews, doc sync. **Plan execution is metadata-gated, NEVER default-parallel** — fan-out follows ONLY what the plan declares (`PAR`/`SEQ` tags + per-phase write set); an untagged plan runs sequentially — why: a derived write set cannot see cascade or generated writes.
>
> 1. **Tag every task `PAR` or `SEQ`.** `PAR` = inputs exclude every pending task's output AND write set disjoint from every other `PAR`. Else `SEQ` — MUST ATTENTION name the dependency forcing it.
> 2. **Group `PAR` into waves.** No edge between members. Two writers of one file NEVER share a wave. Read-only work (search, investigation, review, research) parallelizes freely.
> 3. **Declare before dispatch:** `Parallel plan: wave 1 = [...] · wave 2 = [...] · SEQ = [...] (reason)`.
> 4. **Spawn each wave in ONE message** — every `Agent` call in one response, NEVER dripped per turn. Route each task to its specialist (`.claude/skills/shared/sub-agent-selection-guide.md`); NEVER `code-reviewer` as catch-all.
> 5. **Brief each sub-agent self-contained:** goal · scope + owned files · reference docs · return contract (summary + `Full report:` path, per SYNC:subagent-return-contract) · incremental persistence to `tmp/reports/` (per SYNC:incremental-persistence).
> 6. **Barrier per wave.** Advance ONLY after EVERY member returns (a skipped conditional counts as returned). Merge, mark each task completed/skipped, THEN dispatch the next wave. Mutating steps wait for the barrier.
> 7. **One level deep.** A dispatched sub-agent executes its own brief; further fan-out stays the orchestrator's job unless that agent's `.claude/agents/*.md` definition authorizes it.
>
> **NEVER parallelize:** tasks sharing a write target · a task consuming a pending task's output · trivial single-file work (dispatch overhead > gain) · an order a skill or workflow explicitly fixes · gates awaiting user approval.
>
> **Blocked until:** MUST ATTENTION every task tagged PAR/SEQ with a named reason per SEQ · waves declared + write-set disjointness checked · each wave spawned in ONE message · barrier honored before the next wave.

<!-- /SYNC:parallel-subagent-dispatch -->

<!-- SYNC:parallel-subagent-dispatch:reminder -->

- **MANDATORY** After planning tasks, tag each PAR/SEQ and spawn every PAR wave as parallel sub-agents in ONE message — default parallel for workflows, batch updates, investigation, research, reviews; plan execution fans out ONLY on what the plan declares.

<!-- SYNC:project-protocol-overlay -->

> **Project Protocol Overlay** — Before executing this skill, resolve project overlays from the index at `<docsRoots.projectReference.path>/skill-protocols-reference.md` (default `docs/project-reference/`; `docsRoots.projectReference.path` in `docs/project-config.json` overrides it). A matching `referenceDocs[]` filename may relocate the index within that root; this registry is independent from task-specific reference-doc selection, so omitted or empty `referenceDocs` does not disable it. The index's `**Protocols directory:**` header selects a project-root-relative body directory (default `docs/project-protocols/`). Match this skill against the `Target` column and take the most specific tier ONLY — exact name > glob > `*`. **That precedence orders overlays against EACH OTHER, never against this skill.** Read only matched bodies derived as `<protocols-dir>/<Name>.md`; the row's Body link is display text, never a read path. Reject unsafe paths without reading. A matched body that is missing or malformed is REPORTED and skipped — never reconstructed from the index Description. An absent index or no match -> proceed with no overlay, silently. Full contract: `.claude/skills/project-skill-protocol/references/registry.md`.
>
> Overlays are **ADDITIVE ONLY**: they ADD rules on top of this skill's own protocol and NEVER replace, override, disable, or reinterpret a rule it already states — removing every overlay must return this skill to exactly its documented behavior. An overlay is a BRIEF, not an authority escalation: it can NEVER waive a workflow gate, git discipline, a review gate, or a user-confirmation gate. A genuine overlay-vs-skill conflict, or two equally-specific overlays that directly contradict -> surface both to the user; NEVER resolve silently.

<!-- SYNC:project-protocol-overlay:reminder -->

**MUST ATTENTION** resolve this skill's overlays from the index at `<docsRoots.projectReference.path>/skill-protocols-reference.md` (default `docs/project-reference/`); an empty task `referenceDocs` does NOT disable this lookup. Read ONLY matched bodies from the directory the index header names (default `docs/project-protocols/`). Specificity (exact > glob > `*`) ranks overlays against EACH OTHER, never against the skill. Missing/malformed body → report and skip; no index or no match → proceed silently.

Detailed carriers: `integration-test`, `workflow-greenfield-init`, and the test-architecture review path.
> - `SYNC:ai-agent-as-user-access` — when an AI/machine actor or future contract is evidenced, inspect identity/delegation, capability boundaries, selected API/CLI/MCP/WebMCP/event/SDK surface, safety/consent, audit/observability, and native-format contract tests. Detailed carriers: `workflow-greenfield-init`, `workflow-big-feature`, `architecture-review`.
> - `SYNC:design-system-check` — when UI changes, inspect the design-system and component-contract obligations; route visual/UX depth to the owning UI review.
>
> **Review behavior:** Check only principles applicable to the reviewed scope; record `APPLY-NOW`, `ADAPT-IN-SLICE`, `DEFER-AS-OPPORTUNITY`, `NOT-APPLICABLE`, `BLOCKED`, or `UNVERIFIED` with `file:line`/config/CI evidence, status/severity, owner/route, and next step/revisit trigger. Do not invent findings from a generic checklist, flag unrelated pre-existing gaps as regressions, silently expand the requested scope, or mutate a parent gate merely because advice exists.
>
> **Ownership:** `changes-review` coordinates the applicability pass and routes depth to the owning specialist (`architecture-review`, `integration-test-review`, `security-review`, `performance-review`, `ui-review`, `production-readiness-review`, or another matching review). A specialist reports its own lens and does not duplicate or override another review's verdict; existing brownfield gaps stay advisory unless new, safety-relevant, or explicitly in scope.
>
> **Required review note:** `context/scope | principle/protocol checked | evidence | status/verdict | severity | owner/route | next step/revisit trigger`.
>
> **BLOCKED when:** an applicable principle is required for safety/correctness but missing, unowned, or untestable. Otherwise record an evidence-backed `NOT-APPLICABLE`, advisory, `DEFER-AS-OPPORTUNITY`, or `UNVERIFIED` result according to the lifecycle and change context; creating a greenfield foundation remains subject to its own blocking protocol.

<!-- SYNC:review-principle-awareness:reminder -->

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** Every review first checks the change context and routes only applicable principles to their detailed protocols: scale-ready foundation, test intent in the project's native format (GWT is one option), AI-agent-as-user access, and UI/component design when relevant. Record evidence-backed apply/adapt/defer/N/A/block/unverified status with owner and next step; do not invent unrelated findings or expand scope.

## Closing Reminders

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION Goal:** Review one artifact (PBI, design spec, story, or test spec) for completeness and quality so it is evidence-backed, handoff-ready, and free of missing assumptions or acceptance gaps. For generated PBIs, prove one independently releasable actor-facing outcome with a complete full-flow surface when UI is involved.

**Protocols in force — MUST ATTENTION honor every block below (concise digest of the SYNC/shared blocks this skill carries):**

- **Nested Task Creation:** Parent workflow rows never replace child phase tracking.
- **Project Reference Docs Guide:** Read required project docs before target work.
- **Task Tracking External Report:** Bootstrap tasks; persist review findings to `tmp/reports/`.
- **Critical Thinking Mindset:** Traced `file:line` proof; confidence >80% to act.
- **Evidence Based Reasoning:** No claim without cited evidence; state confidence.
- **Understand Code First:** Read code, grep 3+ patterns before any change.
- **Double Round Trip Review:** Validate findings, fix only current-round blocking findings, and restart the full review until the round severity bar is clear (Round 1: zero findings; Round 2: zero CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM, LOW deferred; binary gates always block).
- **Releasable PBI Contract:** Apply `.claude/skills/shared/releasable-pbi-contract.md`; technical-only PBIs and UI PBIs represented by one isolated screen are FAIL, not WARN.
- **Fresh Context Review:** Spawn fresh zero-memory sub-agent after each fix cycle.
- **Review Protocol Injection:** Embed all 11 protocol bodies verbatim in sub-agent prompts.
- **AI Mistake Prevention:** verify generated content against evidence, trace downstream references, verify all affected outputs, re-read after context loss, surface ambiguity.
- **Severity Rubric:** Classify findings Critical/High/Medium/Low by consequence using `SYNC:severity-rubric`; round 1 blocks on every validated finding, round 2 blocks only CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM, and LOW is recorded/deferred. Failed binary gates always block.
- **Parallel Sub-Agent Dispatch:** Tag tasks PAR/SEQ, group PAR into disjoint-write-set waves, spawn each wave in ONE message, barrier before advancing.

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** execute the main steps IN ORDER — (1) Identify type → (2) Adversarial Mindset + Anti-Bias Gate → (3) type Required/Recommended checklist → (4) M1-M7 BLOCKING gate → (5) Readability checklist → (6) per-type output template → (7) validated-fix + full re-review loop until the current round bar is clear (round 1: zero findings; round 2: zero CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM, with LOWs recorded as deferred); NEVER skip or merge steps without explicit user approval — why: each step catches a distinct defect class the others miss.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** be a SKEPTIC, not a presence-checker — run ALL 6 adversarial techniques (steel-man rejected alternatives, stress-test 3 assumptions, AC-testability, pre-mortem, unseen alternatives, contrarian pass) and clear the Anti-Bias Gate BEFORE any verdict — why: sections that exist but hold weak/untestable content create false confidence worse than missing ones.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** enforce the BLOCKING M1-M7 gate on ALL types — any **M1-M5 or M7** violation forces NEEDS WORK citing the mandate ID + exact section/line; NEVER pass an M1-M5/M7 violation — why: passing it makes this review itself defective.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** M7 (business-visibility) is judged on each case's BODY via the demo test — *"what would a stakeholder SEE change?"*; no answer → NEEDS WORK as TECHNICAL-ONLY. A `When` that is an invocation (handler runs, consumer receives, job fires, data syncs, model inspected) or a `Then` asserting schema/type/nullability/call-count FAILS M7 **even in flawless tech-free prose** — why: M1 governs vocabulary, M7 governs subject matter, and passing a case because its prose is clean is exactly how technical cases accumulate in business specs one bugfix at a time.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** exempt source identifiers only inside the selected profile's declared evidence carriers; the strict default uses `[Source:]`, `**Evidence**`, `CoveredBy`, legacy `IntegrationTest`, frontmatter, and Mermaid — flag leakage in narrative/AC/scenario prose — why: carriers preserve auditable code links without making prose implementation-dependent.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** dispatch on `--type={pbi|story|spec-tests|design}` (infer if omitted) — apply that type's Required/Recommended checklist; verdict = PASS (all Required + ≥50% Recommended) | WARN (all Required, <50% Recommended) | FAIL (any Required fails).
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** for `--type=design` ONLY: run the 9-dimension UI/UX Design Principles pass — all 40 clauses (`UI-1.1`-`UI-9.4`), one dimension at a time; every finding cites `UI-<clause>` + `file:line` + `SYNC:severity-rubric` severity and folds into the existing Required/Recommended verdict; `pbi`/`story`/`spec-tests` are unaffected, and project design-system docs OUTRANK the clauses.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** for `--type=spec-tests`, resolve the case profile before applying identity, evidence, section, or cardinality rules; an unresolved or conflicting profile blocks the verdict — why: a native case contract must not be rejected for differing syntax or silently copied into a duplicate registry.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** property coverage: every universal hard rule/invariant in the selected contract section maps to a universally quantified property case and a boundary counter-case; strict default uses `[HARD]` §4/§5 property TCs, while a native profile uses its declared section and case carrier — why: example-only coverage cannot protect an invariant across its input domain.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** run the findings-validation gate BEFORE fixing — invoke `/why-review --validate-findings <report-path>` first; NEVER edit the artifact to resolve findings before this gate returns CLEAN — why: validate-before-fix at parity with `/plan-review` prevents fixing phantom findings.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** fix only validated blocking findings, then restart the FULL review with a fresh `general-purpose` sub-agent (artifacts are NOT code) and loop until the current exit bar is clear (round 1: zero findings; round 2: zero CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM, LOW deferred) — NEVER spawn a confirmation sub-agent after a bar-clearing round — why: every fix invalidates the prior verdict, but a bar-clearing pass needs no re-confirmation.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** cite `file:line`/section+line evidence for every finding (confidence >80% to act, <60% DO NOT recommend); every NEEDS WORK item must be actionable — why: speculation produces non-fixable findings.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** break work into small todo tasks using `TaskCreate` BEFORE starting; add a final review todo task to verify work quality.

**[TASK-PLANNING]** Before acting, analyze task scope and systematically break it into small todo tasks and sub-tasks using TaskCreate.

> **[IMPORTANT]** Analyze how big the task is and break it into many small todo tasks systematically before starting — this is very important.

**Anti-Rationalization:**

| Evasion | Rebuttal |
| ------- | -------- |
| "Required sections present, looks complete" | Presence ≠ quality. Name what's IN them and the specific failure mode NOT addressed. |
| "ACs are defined" | Are they TESTABLE? Name the automated test a QA engineer writes for each — without clarification. |
| "Alternatives were considered" | Real alternatives or strawmen set up to lose? Steel-man the strongest rejected one. |
| "Verdict is clear, skip the contrarian pass" | Generate 2 sentences arguing the OPPOSITE conclusion first, then decide on evidence. |
| "M1-M5/M7 violation is minor, let it pass" | Passing an M1-M5/M7 violation makes THIS review defective. NEEDS WORK + cite mandate ID + section/line. |
| "No tech words in it — M7 passes" | M1 ≠ M7. Apply the demo test to the BODY: what would a stakeholder SEE change? No answer → FAIL, however clean the prose. |
| "This sync/consumer case is business-critical, so it stays" | If it's business-critical it's demoable — rewrite it demoably. A case that CANNOT be rewritten demoably is exactly what M7 moves out. |
| "Source name in prose, flag it" | Check the selected profile's declared carrier first — the strict default uses `[Source:]`/`**Evidence**`/`CoveredBy`/legacy `IntegrationTest`/frontmatter/Mermaid. |
| "Fix the finding, then I'm done" | Validate findings (`/why-review`) BEFORE fixing, then restart the FULL review until the current exit bar is clear (round 1: zero findings; round 2: zero CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM, LOW deferred). |
| "Skip evidence for review judgments" | Cite section+line for every finding; confidence >80% to act, <60% DO NOT recommend. |

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** SKEPTIC stance — clear the Anti-Bias Gate (adversarial techniques) before any verdict.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** M6 enforcement — NEEDS WORK on any **M1-M5 or M7** violation, cite mandate ID + section/line; carriers exempt.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** M7 — apply the demo test to each case's BODY, not its prose; an invocation-shaped `When` or a schema/type/call-count `Then` is TECHNICAL-ONLY and FAILS even when perfectly tech-free.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** validate findings before fixing, then restart the FULL fresh review until the current exit bar is clear (round 1: zero findings; round 2: zero CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM, LOW deferred).
