> **Renamed:** formerly `workflow-product-discovery` — now `/workflow-idea-to-spec`. The old name no longer resolves as a slash command.

## Quick Summary

**Goal:** [Workflow] Trigger the spec-driven Idea-to-Spec workflow to convert a raw idea — a raw vision or problem → structured brainstorm framing → canonical, provisional Feature Spec (the tech-free 8-section spec + §8 test specs at `docs/specs/{Bucket}/README.{Feature}.md`, `Evidence: TBD` until code lands) → reviewed and docs-synced. This workflow **STOPS at the reviewed Feature Spec** — it does NOT produce a PBI backlog. For a backlog, chain `workflow-spec-to-pbi` afterward; for idea → full backlog in one pass use `workflow-idea-to-pbi`; for code→spec (implementation already exists) use `workflow-code-to-spec`.

**Workflow:**

1. **Frame** — brainstorm the idea, analyze domain, validate the problem framing (why-review).
2. **Author** — capture the idea, then author the canonical provisional Feature Spec (`spec [mode=draft]`) + §8 test specs (`spec [mode=tests]`).
3. **Review & Sync** — review the test specs and the Feature Spec, validate rationale (why-review), sync docs.

**Key Rules:**

- MUST ATTENTION keep claims evidence-based (`file:line`) with confidence >80% to act.
- MUST ATTENTION keep task tracking updated as each step starts/completes.
- MUST ATTENTION define success criteria before execution and loop until observable verification passes.
- MUST ATTENTION when creating/reviewing specs or tests, name `Business Intent / Invariant Guarded` or the protected business intent/invariant and ensure the test would fail if that intent breaks.
- MUST ATTENTION author the spec via `spec [mode=draft]` — idea-sourced, no code yet → §8 `Evidence: TBD`, `Status: Planned`, frontmatter `provisional: true`.
- NEVER decompose into PBIs/stories/backlog here — that is `workflow-spec-to-pbi`'s job. NEVER skip the Feature Spec authoring core.

## When to Use

- PO/BA has a raw product vision, problem statement, or "we need to build X" starting point and wants a canonical Feature Spec
- Team wants to capture intended behavior as a tech-free spec BEFORE any code exists (spec-first / TDD-first)
- A single idea or capability needs a reviewed, AI-implementable Feature Spec as the source of truth for later implementation

## When NOT to Use

- Implementation already exists and you want a spec FROM code → use `workflow-code-to-spec`
- You want a full grooming-ready PBI backlog from the idea in one pass → use `workflow-idea-to-pbi`
- You already have a Feature Spec and want PBIs from it → use `workflow-spec-to-pbi`
- Implementation work (code writing) → use `workflow-feature` or `workflow-big-feature`
- Bug fixes → use `workflow-bugfix`

## Key Mechanics

### 1. Brainstorm → Converge on the Capability to Spec

The `/brainstorm` step frames the idea using the Double Diamond process:

- **Problem framing:** POV statement, 5 Whys / Fishbone, JTBD job stories, HMW questions
- **Opportunity framing:** Opportunity Solution Tree (enhancement) OR Lean Canvas (new product)
- **Ideation:** SCAMPER, Crazy 8s, Impact Mapping
- **Convergence:** pick the single feature/capability to author as a Feature Spec

Output: the converged capability (or a short list if multiple distinct capabilities emerge).
AI presents the framing and confirms scope: **"Which capability should we author as a Feature Spec?"** If multiple distinct capabilities are in scope, confirm with the user and author one Feature Spec per capability (sub-agent per capability for 4+ — see Scale awareness).

### 1a. Spec-Discovery (Landscape Investigation — After brainstorm, Before domain-analysis)

`/spec-discovery` investigates the surrounding system BEFORE authoring: it Globs `docs/specs/**` to classify every related / overlapping / affected Feature Spec, scouts related code (graph-expanded when `.code-graph/graph.db` exists), and surfaces gaps, missing test cases / user stories, and the **invariant landscape** the idea must respect. It ends in a **BLOCKING scope-decision gate** — author a NEW spec, EXTEND an existing one, or SPLIT into N — so no duplicate / overlapping spec is authored. Greenfield (no specs + no code) short-circuits with a recorded reason.

### 2. Why-Review Gate (After domain-analysis, Before spec authoring)

Before authoring the spec, validate the idea framing with `/why-review`:

**Challenge prompts:**

- Is this truly the right problem to solve? What was deprioritized and why?
- Pre-mortem: if this is built and misses in 6 months, what was the root cause?
- Are there systemic alternatives (infrastructure change, process change) that make this unnecessary?

| Result | Action                                        |
| ------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| PASS   | Proceed to spec authoring                     |
| WARN   | Document risk, acknowledge with user, proceed |
| FAIL   | Revisit brainstorm framing before authoring   |

### 3. Spec Authoring Flow (core mechanic — idea → provisional Feature Spec)

These steps run in sequence. **Spec-driven order: idea → draft Feature Spec → test specs → review.**

| Step                                 | Purpose                                                                                                                  | Output                                          |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `/idea`                              | Capture the converged idea as a structured artifact                                                                      | `team-artifacts/ideas/{date}-po-idea-{slug}.md` |
| `/spec [mode=draft]`                 | Author the canonical tech-free 8-section Feature Spec §1-7 FROM the idea text (no code grep; `provisional: true` marker) | `docs/specs/{Bucket}/README.{Feature}.md`       |
| `/spec [mode=tests]`                 | Author §8 TC-{FEATURE}-{NNN} behavioral test cases (`Evidence: TBD`, `Status: Planned` — before any code)                | Feature Spec §8 Test Specifications             |
| `/artifact-review --type=spec-tests` | Test-spec quality check                                                                                                  | Reviewed §8 TCs                                 |
| `/artifact-review`                   | Feature Spec quality check                                                                                               | Reviewed Feature Spec                           |
| `/design-spec`                       | UI ideas only — author tech-agnostic UI specs (NO mockup/backlog; spec-only contract preserved); gated by `SYNC:existing-ui-research`. Skip for backend-only ideas | UI design specs                                 |
| `/spec-clarify`                     | Brainstorm open questions, audit non-obvious decisions, confirm with user (BLOCKING)                                     | Clarified spec + Decisions Log                  |
| `/why-review`                        | Validate the authored spec's rationale and completeness                                                                  | Why-Review checklist                            |
| `/docs-update`                       | Sync the Feature Spec (§8) and derived bucket indexes                                                                    | Docs-update report                              |

**Provisional output:** because no code exists yet, the spec is provisional — §8 TCs carry `Evidence: TBD` and `Status: Planned`, and frontmatter carries `provisional: true`. The first `workflow-code-to-spec` / `spec [mode=update]` run against real code upgrades `TBD` → real `[Source:]` anchors and clears the provisional flag.

> **Spec-hub coupling (§6 interaction surface ↔ UI artifacts):** the `/design-spec` produced here is NOT a standalone artifact — it is the deep companion of the governing Feature Spec's **§6 interaction surface** (View Inventory / Navigation Map / Key UI States / per-story click-path). `design-spec` seeds from §6 and records its own path in the spec's `design_spec:` frontmatter so the spec stays the navigable hub: a reader goes spec → §6 thin intent → `design-spec` deep companion, and the two never drift. Keep deep visual fidelity (layout, tokens, pixel detail) in the `design-spec`, never in §6. See the `SYNC:ui-intent-layer` block below for the full rule — do not restate it here. Backend-only ideas (no UI) → skip `/design-spec` and state that reason.

### 4. Handoff

At `/workflow-end`, AI presents:

- Session summary: M Feature Specs authored (provisional), §8 TC counts, open questions (confidence < 80%)
- Feature Specs authored: `docs/specs/{Bucket}/README.{Feature}.md` paths
- Provisional note: these specs carry `Evidence: TBD` + `provisional: true` until code lands — reconcile via `workflow-code-to-spec` / `spec [mode=update]` once implemented
- Recommended next workflow: `/start-workflow workflow-spec-to-pbi` (decompose the Feature Spec(s) into a grooming-ready PBI backlog) OR `/start-workflow workflow-feature` (implement directly from the spec)

## Conditional Skip Rules

| Step                 | Skip When                                                                |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `/domain-analysis`   | No new domain entities or aggregates involved                            |
| `/why-review` (gate) | User has already validated the idea rationale; no alternatives available |

**IMPORTANT MANDATORY Steps:** /web-research -> /deep-research -> /brainstorm -> /spec-discovery -> /domain-analysis -> /why-review -> /idea -> /spec [mode=draft] -> /spec [mode=tests] -> /artifact-review --type=spec-tests -> /artifact-review -> /design-spec -> /spec-clarify -> /why-review -> /docs-update -> /feature-presentation -> /workflow-end -> /watzup

> **[BLOCKING]** Each step MUST ATTENTION invoke its `Skill` tool — marking a task `completed` without skill invocation is a workflow violation. NEVER batch-complete validation gates.

Activate the `workflow-idea-to-spec` workflow. Run `/start-workflow workflow-idea-to-spec` with the user's prompt as context.

**Steps:**
/web-research → /deep-research → /brainstorm → /spec-discovery → /domain-analysis → /why-review → /idea → /spec [mode=draft] → /spec [mode=tests] → /artifact-review --type=spec-tests → /artifact-review → /design-spec → /spec-clarify → /why-review → /docs-update → /feature-presentation → /workflow-end → /watzup

> **Scale awareness:** When the brainstorm converges on multiple distinct capabilities, this workflow authors one Feature Spec per capability. For 4+ capabilities, spawn one `spec` sub-agent per capability in ONE message (each gets the framing context + output path); the main context assembles and reviews. Use incremental-write patterns to prevent context overrun.

> **AI Mistake Prevention** — Failure modes to avoid on every task:
>
> **Re-read files after context changes.** Context compaction, resume, or long-running work can make memory stale; verify current files before acting.
> **Verify generated content against source evidence.** AI hallucinates APIs, names, claims, and document facts. Check the relevant source before documenting or referencing.
> **Check downstream references before deleting or renaming.** Removing an artifact can stale docs, generated mirrors, configs, and callers; map references first.
> **Trace the full impact chain after edits.** Changing a definition can miss derived outputs and consumers. Follow the affected chain before declaring done.
> **Verify ALL affected outputs, not just the first.** One green check is not all green checks; validate every output surface the change can affect.
> **Assume existing values are intentional — ask WHY before changing.** Before changing a constant, limit, flag, wording, or pattern, read nearby context and history.
> **Surface ambiguity before acting — don't pick silently.** Multiple valid interpretations require an explicit question or stated assumption with risk.
> **Keep shared guidance role-relevant.** Universal guidance must help every receiving skill or agent; code-specific obligations belong only in code-specific protocols.

> 2. Create one task per declared phase before phase work. When nested, prefix subjects `[N.M] $skill-name — phase`.
> 3. When nested, link the parent with `TaskUpdate(parentTaskId, addBlockedBy: [childIds])`.
> 4. Orchestrators must pre-expand a child skill's phase list and link the workflow row before invoking that child skill or sub-agent.
> 5. Mark exactly one child `in_progress` before work and `completed` immediately after evidence is written.
> 6. Complete the parent only after all child tasks are completed or explicitly cancelled with reason.
>
> **Blocked until:** `TaskList` done, child phases created, parent linked when nested, first child marked `in_progress`.

> 1. **View Inventory** — list each view/screen by its UX ROLE and purpose (e.g. "list of items", "item editor", "confirmation step") and what information it presents. Describe by role, never by an implementation name.
> 2. **Navigation Map** — how a user moves between views: entry points, transitions, and exits. Trace how this surface connects to neighboring features already in the system.
> 3. **Key observable UI States** — the distinct states a user can observe per view (empty, loading, populated, error, success, permission-denied, etc.) — described as what the user perceives, not how it is rendered.
> 4. **Per-story interaction flow** — for each user story, the step-by-step click/action path from intent to outcome, cross-referenced to the logical IDs the spec already owns (`US-`/`OP-`/`BR-`).
> 5. **Couple to the companion design artifact** — keep deep visual fidelity (layout, tokens, pixel detail) OUT of the spec; it lives in the linked `design-spec`/mockup. Record that companion's path in the spec frontmatter so the spec stays the navigable hub.

## Closing Reminders

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION Goal:** Ensure spec-driven idea-to-spec converts a raw idea into ONE canonical, provisional Feature Spec — reviewed and docs-synced, ready to hand off for backlog decomposition or implementation.

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION — Protocols in force (concise digest of the SYNC/shared blocks this skill carries; each is a signpost to its canonical body above):**

- **AI Mistake Prevention:** verify generated content against evidence, trace downstream references, verify all affected outputs, re-read after context loss, surface ambiguity.
- **Nested Task Creation:** expand child phases and link parent when nested; one in-progress.
- **Critical Thinking:** trace every claim, confidence >80% to act, never present guess as fact.
- **Incremental Persistence:** write findings to `plans/reports/` per file — never hold in memory.
- **Sub-Agent Return Contract:** return summary only (≤10 bullets) with `Full report:` path.

- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** break work into small todo tasks using `TaskCreate` BEFORE starting — one task per workflow step (per capability when multiple capabilities are in scope)
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** brainstorm converges on the capability to spec BEFORE the `/idea` step
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** SPEC-DRIVEN ORDER — author the Feature Spec (`/spec [mode=draft]` → `/spec [mode=tests]`) and review it; this workflow STOPS at the reviewed spec
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** PROVISIONAL OUTPUT — §8 carries `Evidence: TBD` / `Status: Planned` and frontmatter `provisional: true`; reconcile against code later via `workflow-code-to-spec`
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** NEVER decompose into PBIs/stories/backlog here — chain `workflow-spec-to-pbi` for a backlog
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** why-review runs after domain-analysis — FAIL revisits framing, WARN requires user acknowledgment
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** validate decisions with user via `AskUserQuestion` — never auto-select scope
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** add a final review todo task to verify the authored Feature Spec(s)

**[TASK-PLANNING]** Before acting, analyze task scope and systematically break it into small todo tasks and sub-tasks using TaskCreate.

> **[IMPORTANT]** Analyze how big the task is and break it into many small todo tasks systematically before starting — this is very important.
> **Anti-Rationalization:**
