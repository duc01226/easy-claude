## Quick Summary

> **Portability:** `docs/specs/` is the fixed Feature Spec root. `docs/templates/detailed-feature-spec-template.md` remains the default template unless `workflowPatterns.featureDocTemplate` points to another template.

**[IMPORTANT] TaskCreate** — Break ALL work into small tasks BEFORE starting. For simple tasks, ask user whether to skip.

**Goal:** Own the entire Feature Spec lifecycle in one skill — author/maintain tech-free 8-section business Feature Specs (code evidence carried only in Section 8 test-case anchors, never prose), generate Section 8 test specifications, and reconcile those TCs with integration test code — producing a tech-free, AI-implementable Feature Spec whose Section 8 TC registry stays the single source of truth, traceable to integration test code, so any team can rebuild the feature on any stack from the spec alone. The mode you run determines which `references/` body drives work; the shared §8 contract, M1-M6 mandates, and quality philosophy below apply every mode.

**Summary:**

- Resolve the mode FIRST (draft/init/update/audit/amend/tests/sync) — an explicit `[mode=<x>]` wins, else infer from request + repo state; when ambiguous ask via `AskUserQuestion` before any mutating mode, then read the matching `references/{author,tests,sync}.md` body and never run a mode from memory.
- §1-7 prose is STRICTLY tech-free (no framework/product/language/persistence/auth names per `spec-principles.md` §3.2); technical identifiers live ONLY in evidence carriers — Section 8 is the canonical TC registry (`TC-{FEATURE}-{NNN}`) and must never be overwritten during `update`.
- Every TC carries verifiable `[Source: namespace/service/id]` evidence — the sole exception is `mode=draft`, where idea-sourced specs use `Evidence: TBD` + provisional flag, upgraded to real anchors on the first code-sourced run.
- Honor the M1-M6 mandates (`sdd-artifact-contract.md`) and canonical TC format (`shared/tc-format.md`); `INDEX.md`/ERD are derived artifacts — flag refresh need in `update` but never trigger `/spec-index` here.

> **Renamed:** formerly `/feature-spec` (and earlier `/feature-docs`); the former `/spec-tests` skill is now folded in as `mode=tests` / `mode=sync`. Those names no longer resolve as slash commands — use `/spec` with the matching mode.

### Modes (resolve mode FIRST — BLOCKING)

| Mode     | Use when…                                                          | Body            |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------- |
| `draft`  | Author a provisional spec from an idea/requirement/prompt — **no code yet** (TDD-first, §8 `Evidence: TBD`, provisional marker) | `references/author.md` |
| `init`   | No `docs/specs/{Bucket}/` exists — author a full 8-section spec from source | `references/author.md` |
| `update` | Docs exist + code changed — section-impact-mapped updates          | `references/author.md` |
| `audit`  | `--audit` flag or user asks — staleness report per section (never mutates docs) | `references/author.md` |
| `amend`  | `[mode=amend]` from the bugfix workflow — minimal regression-scoped §3/§4/§8 touch only | `references/author.md` |
| `tests`  | Generate or update Section 8 `TC-{FEATURE}-{NNN}` test specifications | `references/tests.md`  |
| `sync`   | Reconcile §8 TCs ↔ integration test code (forward/reverse/harvest, orphan, staleness); `harvest` captures a SPEC-SILENT invariant into §4/§5/§8 | `references/sync.md`   |

**Mode resolution (do this before any work):**

1. Parse the mode from the invocation: explicit `[mode=<x>]` arg wins; else infer from request + repo state ("from idea/requirements/prompt", "draft spec", "no code yet" → `draft`; no `docs/specs/{Bucket}/` AND code exists to source from → `init`; docs exist + diff → `update`; "audit/stale" → `audit`; bugfix caller → `amend`; "write/update test specs", "TCs" → `tests`; "sync tests", "reconcile §8 with tests" → `sync`). **`draft` vs `init`:** both author a new spec, but `draft` sources from idea/requirement text (no code → `Evidence: TBD`, provisional) while `init` sources from existing code (real `[Source:]` evidence). "No docs" alone does NOT imply `init` — check whether code exists to source from. `draft` never auto-overwrites existing §8 TCs.
2. If ambiguous, present the detected mode via `AskUserQuestion` before proceeding — NEVER auto-start a mutating mode.
3. **Read the matching `references/` body** — it is the single source of truth for that mode's procedure, gates, and output contract. Do not run a mode from memory.

**Key Rules (all modes):**

- **[BLOCKING]** Read `docs/project-reference/spec-principles.md` — repo-local prose/evidence rules (§3 prose scope + §3.2 banned prose-token list). For the AI-implementability criteria + tech-agnostic mandates, read `.claude/skills/shared/sdd-artifact-contract.md` ("AI-Implementability Gate" + mandates M1-M6) — those are the canonical authority, not the local stub.
- **[BLOCKING]** EVERY test case MUST carry verifiable code evidence as a `[Source: namespace/service/id]` abstract anchor in its Section 8 hidden carrier — physical `file:line` lives only in the provenance sidecar.
  > **Exception (`mode=draft`):** an idea-sourced spec has no code yet — its §8 TCs carry `Evidence: TBD` (reference-only) and the spec is flagged provisional (`provisional: true` frontmatter + a "DRAFT — unverified until code lands" header banner). The first `update`/`init` run against real code MUST upgrade every `TBD` to a real `[Source:]` anchor and clear the provisional flag. This mirrors existing TDD-first handling — it relaxes evidence ONLY for draft, never for code-sourced modes.
- **[BLOCKING]** Section 8 is the **canonical TC registry** — §8 TCs are the source of truth; integration test code implements them. The `tests` mode owns generation; `sync` mode reconciles drift; the author modes (`draft`/`init`) populate §8 at authoring time (`draft` with `Evidence: TBD`, `init` with real `[Source:]`) and MUST NOT overwrite existing TCs during UPDATE.
- Authored docs MUST match the master template's **8 tech-free sections** (Overview, Glossary, User Stories & AC, Business Rules, Domain Model, Process Flows, Permissions & Roles, Test Specifications) + YAML frontmatter — zero technical terms in prose, size caps enforced.
- **[BLOCKING] Canonical TC format authority:** `.claude/skills/shared/tc-format.md` (GWT template, Evidence carrier, decade-numbering, Preservation Tests). **M1-M6 mandates:** `.claude/skills/shared/sdd-artifact-contract.md` — any violation FAILS the artifact.

> `docs/project-reference/feature-spec-reference.md` — project-specific Feature Spec patterns (read directly when relevant). `docs/project-reference/domain-entities-reference.md` — domain entity catalog, relationships, cross-service sync.

### 8-Section Feature Spec Rules (canonical reference)

> Canonical home for the Feature Spec rules; applies to any edit under the Feature Spec docs root.

**Format:** Tech-free 8-section Feature Spec. Activate the `/spec` skill before editing.

**Read first:** `docs/project-reference/feature-spec-reference.md`, `docs/project-reference/spec-system-reference.md`, and `docs/project-reference/spec-principles.md`. For behavior/public-contract changes, also read `docs/project-reference/workflow-spec-test-code-cycle-reference.md`.

**8 sections (exact order):** 1. Overview · 2. Glossary · 3. User Stories & Acceptance Criteria · 4. Business Rules · 5. Domain Model · 6. Process Flows · 7. Permissions & Roles · 8. Test Specifications — then a trailing Change History. No technical sections (Commands/Events/API/Cross-Service/Performance/Troubleshooting) — code is the technical source of truth.

**Mandatory:**

- §1-7 prose is STRICTLY tech-free — no framework/product/language/persistence/messaging/auth names (banned tokens → `spec-principles.md` §3.2). Technical identifiers live ONLY in evidence carriers.
- Section 5 (Domain Model): Mermaid ERD + `[Source: component/{service}/{id}]` abstract anchor per entity (cannot be omitted)
- Section 4 (Business Rules): `[Source: rule/{service}/{id}]` abstract anchor per rule group
- Section 8 (Test Specifications): canonical TC source — TC-{FEATURE}-{NNN} IDs, each carrying a hidden `[Source: namespace/service/id]` carrier + an `IntegrationTest:` field

**Rules:**

- TC IDs live in Section 8 only — never authored in `docs/specs/` directly
- Section 8 authored via `/spec [mode=tests]`; `/spec [mode=init]` populates it only during initial authoring
- No line-count cap applies to Feature Specs. Split the capability only when TCs>40 or distinct module-level capabilities emerge.
- Change History entry required for every functional change (trailing section)

### M1-M6 Compliance (BLOCKING — applies to every authored spec and every TC)

See `.claude/skills/shared/sdd-artifact-contract.md` → "AI-SDD Mandates (M1-M6)" for the full BLOCKING criteria. In brief: **M1** tech-agnostic prose; **M2** no source code in prose; **M3** logical-IDs-first traceability with a SEPARATE `[Source:]` carrier; **M4** AI-implementability (one interpretation, named success/failure); **M5** rebuild-from-scratch on any stack from §1-8 prose alone. Tech terms are allowed ONLY inside evidence carriers (`**Evidence**`, `IntegrationTest`, `[Source:]`), YAML frontmatter, and ` ```mermaid ``` ` blocks.

## Derived-Index Delegation

This skill owns the **canonical** Feature Spec (§1-8) and its §8 TC registry. The bucket `INDEX.md` and cross-capability ERD are **derived** artifacts regenerated by `/spec-index` FROM these specs — never a source of truth, and never authored here. In `update` mode, flag "derived spec artifact refresh may be required" but do NOT trigger `/spec-index` directly (separation of concerns).

---

## Workflow Recommendation

> **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION — NO EXCEPTIONS:** If you are NOT already in a workflow, you MUST ATTENTION use `AskUserQuestion` to ask the user. Do NOT judge task complexity or decide this is "simple enough to skip" — the user decides whether to use a workflow, not you:
>
> 1. **Activate `workflow-feature` workflow** (Recommended) — spec-driven with tests by default: scout → investigate → domain-analysis → why-review → spec → plan → plan-review → plan-validate → why-review → spec [mode=tests] → why-review → review-artifact --type=spec-tests → plan → plan-review → feature-implement → review-domain-entities → spec [mode=tests] → why-review → review-artifact --type=spec-tests → spec [mode=sync] → integration-test → integration-test-review → integration-test-verify → workflow-review-changes → production-readiness-review → security-review → changelog → test → docs-update → workflow-end → watzup
> 2. **Execute `/spec` directly** — run this skill standalone in the resolved mode

---

## Next Steps

**[BLOCKING]** After completing, use `AskUserQuestion` to present options. Do NOT skip — user decides:

- **"/spec [mode=tests] (Recommended)"** — Generate/update Section 8 test specs for the documented features (if you just authored/updated a spec)
- **"/spec [mode=sync]"** — Reconcile Section 8 TCs ↔ integration test code
- **"/review-artifact --type=spec-tests"** — Audit TC coverage + GIVEN/WHEN/THEN quality
- **"Skip, continue manually"** — user decides

## Closing Reminders

- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION Goal:** Produce a tech-free, AI-implementable Feature Spec whose Section 8 TC registry stays the single source of truth, traceable to integration test code — so any team can rebuild the feature on any stack from the spec alone

**Protocols in force (concise digest of the SYNC/shared blocks this skill carries — MUST ATTENTION honor each canonical body):**

- **Cross-Service Check:** ALWAYS scan producers, consumers, sagas, contracts before concluding; missing consumer = silent regression.
- **Evidence:** cite `file:line` for every claim; confidence >80% to act, <60% NEVER recommend.
- **Critical Thinking:** apply critical + sequential thinking; NEVER present a guess as fact.
- **AI Mistake Prevention:** verify generated content against evidence, trace downstream references, verify all affected outputs, re-read after context loss, surface ambiguity.

- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION [BLOCKING]** Resolve the mode FIRST and read its `references/{author,tests,sync}.md` body — NEVER run `draft`/`init`/`update`/`audit`/`amend`/`tests`/`sync` from memory; ambiguous → `AskUserQuestion` before any mutating mode — why: each mode's gates + output contract live in its body, not in this entry skill
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION [BLOCKING]** EVERY test case MUST carry verifiable code evidence as a `[Source: namespace/service/id]` abstract anchor in its Section 8 hidden carrier — physical `file:line` → provenance sidecar only; sole exception `mode=draft` (`Evidence: TBD` + provisional flag, upgraded to real anchor on first code-sourced run) — why: a TC without evidence is unverifiable and silently rots
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION [BLOCKING]** Section 8 is the canonical TC registry — existing TCs MUST NOT be overwritten during `update`; `tests` mode owns generation, `sync` mode reconciles drift — why: integration test code implements §8, so overwriting it orphans real tests
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION [BLOCKING]** §1-7 prose is STRICTLY tech-free — no framework/product/language/persistence/messaging/auth names (banned tokens → `spec-principles.md` §3.2); technical identifiers live ONLY in evidence carriers, frontmatter, and mermaid blocks — why: M1/M5 require rebuild-from-scratch on any stack
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION [BLOCKING]** Honor M1-M6 mandates (`.claude/skills/shared/sdd-artifact-contract.md`) + canonical TC format (`.claude/skills/shared/tc-format.md`) — any violation FAILS the artifact; no line-count cap applies, split only for TC volume or distinct capabilities
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** `INDEX.md`/ERD are DERIVED — flag refresh need in `update`, NEVER trigger `/spec-index` here — why: separation of concerns keeps the canonical spec the only source of truth
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** evidence gate — cite `file:line`/grep for every claim, confidence >80% to act, <60% do NOT recommend; verify AI-generated TC/source anchors against ACTUAL code (grep to confirm) before authoring — why: hallucinated `[Source:]` anchors break traceability
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** cross-service check before concluding any spec/§8 work — scan producers, consumers, sagas, contracts; per touchpoint owner · message · risk (NONE/ADDITIVE/BREAKING) — why: a missing downstream consumer is a silent regression
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION [BLOCKING]** Break work into small `TaskCreate` tasks BEFORE starting (one per file read) + a final review task; on context loss `TaskList` first, never duplicate — why: long spec files exhaust context and lose un-tracked progress
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** Search codebase for 3+ similar patterns and read existing spec siblings before authoring new content — match local conventions over generic defaults

**Anti-Rationalization:**

| Evasion                                          | Rebuttal                                                                                           |
| ------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "Mode is obvious, skip the `references/` body"   | The body owns gates + output contract — running from memory drifts. Read it every time.            |
| "This TC's source is clear, skip the anchor"     | No `[Source:]` carrier (or `Evidence: TBD` for non-draft) = unverifiable TC. Add the anchor.        |
| "`update` — just regenerate Section 8"           | §8 is canonical; integration tests implement it. NEVER overwrite — `sync` reconciles drift.        |
| "One tech name in prose is harmless"             | One banned token fails M1 and breaks rebuild-on-any-stack. Move it to an evidence carrier.          |
| "Small spec, skip task tracking"                 | Skip depth, NEVER skip tracking — context loss wipes un-tracked progress.                           |
| "Index looks stale, I'll just run `/spec-index`" | Not this skill's job — flag the refresh need; derived artifacts regenerate separately.              |

**[TASK-PLANNING]** MUST ATTENTION analyze task scope and break into small todo tasks/sub-tasks via TaskCreate before acting.

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** Resolve the mode FIRST + read its `references/` body · EVERY §8 TC carries a `[Source:]` evidence anchor (except `mode=draft`) · §1-7 prose STRICTLY tech-free — the three rules this skill must never skip.
