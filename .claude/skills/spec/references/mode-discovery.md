# `/spec [mode=discovery]` — pre-spec landscape investigation reference

> Loaded by `spec/SKILL.md`'s Mode Dispatch when invoked as `/spec [mode=discovery] [--investigation=<report path>]`. This contract REPLACES the spec authoring body for the invocation: it reads the spec corpus and related code, reports the landscape, gates the scope decision with the user, and hands off. It never authors or edits a spec. It runs INLINE on the main agent.

## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Before a single line of a new Feature Spec is authored, deliver the pre-spec landscape — every existing Feature Spec the idea relates to / overlaps / depends on / would affect, the related code logic, the missing features and missing test cases / user stories, the system unknowns, and the invariant landscape the new spec must respect — so the author never ships a duplicate, contradicts a [HARD] rule, or specs into a blind spot.

**Summary:**

- This is BOTH spec-aware and code-aware: it reads `<spec root>/**` (the canonical Feature Specs — default `docs/specs`; a `specRoots.business.path` entry in `docs/project-config.json` overrides the path) AND delegates to `/investigate` (plus an optional code-graph hint) for the code logic the idea touches. Spec-only or code-only discovery misses half the landscape.
- It runs BEFORE `spec [mode=draft]` and feeds it. Its job is to decide WHETHER a new standalone spec is even the right move — the alternative is extending an existing spec, which only a spec-corpus scan can reveal.
- It is INLINE on the main agent (NOT a sub-agent) because step 5 is a BLOCKING `AskUserQuestion` scope-decision gate that only works inline. It MAY spawn sub-agents for parallel spec reads, but it orchestrates and gates inline.
- **Optional input `--investigation=<report path>`** — a same-run `/investigate` report the caller (or the plan) explicitly names. Step 2 reuses it instead of re-running `/investigate` and delegates only slices it does not cover. Without the input, Step 2 runs `/investigate {keywords}` as usual — never assume an earlier investigation from context you were not handed.
- Greenfield short-circuit: when there are no specs AND no code, auto-detect it, record the reason, skip the heavy discovery, and hand off a minimal landscape — never grind through empty discovery.
- **Main steps (0→6) — do ALL in order:** (0) frame scope = keywords/entities/bucket → (1) spec-corpus discovery = Glob all candidate specs under the spec root (default `docs/specs`; a `specRoots.business.path` entry in `docs/project-config.json` overrides the path), read §1/§4/§5/§8, classify each EXTENDS/OVERLAPS/DEPENDS-ON/AFFECTED/UNRELATED with `file:line` → (2) code-logic discovery = `/investigate` + optional graph hint, bridge code→spec via §8 `[Source:]` → (3) gap & invariant analysis = missing features, missing TCs/user stories, system unknowns, [HARD]/§5 invariant landscape → (4) report incrementally to `plans/.../spec-discovery-{slug}.md` → (5) BLOCKING `AskUserQuestion` scope gate = recommend NEW / EXTEND X / SPLIT, confirm cross-refs → (6) handoff to `domain-analysis` + `spec [mode=draft|update]`.

**Workflow:**

0. **Scope** — read the framed capability (brainstorm/idea output); extract keywords, candidate entities/actors, target spec bucket.
1. **Spec-corpus discovery** — `Glob <spec root>/**/README.*.md` (default `docs/specs`; a `specRoots.business.path` entry in `docs/project-config.json` overrides the path); read §1/§4/§5/§8 of each candidate; classify each as EXTENDS / OVERLAPS / DEPENDS-ON / AFFECTED / UNRELATED.
2. **Code-logic discovery** — reuse the `--investigation=<report path>` report when given, else `/investigate {keywords}`; plus an optional graph hint on key files when `.code-graph/graph.db` exists and the blast radius looks high-risk; bridge code→spec via §8 `[Source:]` anchors.
3. **Gap & invariant analysis** — missing features, missing test cases / user stories, system unknowns (<80% confidence), and the existing [HARD] rules / §5 invariants the idea must respect.
4. **Report** — write `<plans root>/{plan-dir}/research/spec-discovery-{slug}.md` (plans root default `plans/`; a `docsRoots.plans.path` entry in `docs/project-config.json` overrides the path) incrementally (Related Specs · Related Code · Affected Specs · Gaps · Invariant Landscape · Open Questions).
5. **Scope-decision gate (BLOCKING `AskUserQuestion`)** — recommend NEW / EXTEND existing X / SPLIT into N, and confirm which existing specs to cross-reference.
6. **Handoff** — feed entities, invariants, cross-refs, and gaps into `domain-analysis` + `spec [mode=draft]`.

**Key Rules:**

- Landscape over implementation — surface related/overlapping/affected specs + the invariant landscape fast; this is NOT the spec author and NOT a deep investigation.
- INLINE execution — the step 5 user gate is BLOCKING and only works inline; spawn sub-agents only for parallel spec reads, never delegate the whole skill.
- NEVER auto-pick NEW — step 5 is a BLOCKING user gate. OVERLAPS is exactly what the spec scan exists to catch; recommend, then let the user decide scope.
- The graph is optional advice; grep + read always bridge code→spec via `[Source:]` anchors, and an absent or stale graph is never a finding.

# Spec Discovery — Pre-Spec Landscape Investigation

---

## When to Use

- About to author a NEW Feature Spec from an idea / requirement / brainstorm output, before `spec [mode=draft]` runs.
- Need to know whether the idea is genuinely new or overlaps an existing spec (duplicate-spec prevention).
- Need the invariant landscape — the existing [HARD] rules and §5 invariants a new capability must respect or might violate.

**NOT for:** authoring the spec (use `spec [mode=draft]`), deep root-cause analysis of existing code (use `investigate`), generating Section 8 test cases (use `spec [mode=tests]`), regenerating the derived bucket index/ERD (use `spec [mode=index]`).

---

## Phase 0: Classify Corpus & Short-Circuit

**Before any discovery**, classify what landscape exists. This decides which steps run.

| Corpus state                | Detection                                                              | Route                                                                        |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Specs + code**            | `<spec root>/**/README.*.md` present AND source files for keywords (default `docs/specs`; `specRoots.business.path` in `docs/project-config.json` overrides the root) | Full run — steps 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6                                            |
| **Specs only**              | Specs present, no code yet (provisional/draft-era project)            | Steps 1, 3, 4, 5 — skip step 2 code discovery (record "no code yet")        |
| **Code only**               | No specs yet, code exists                                             | Steps 2, 3, 4, 5 — step 1 records "no existing specs", bridge gaps from code |
| **Greenfield (empty)**      | No specs AND no source for keywords                                  | **Short-circuit** — record reason, skip heavy discovery, minimal handoff     |

> **Greenfield / empty-corpus short-circuit.** When Phase 0 detects no specs AND no code: record `Corpus: greenfield — no specs, no code for {keywords}` with the `Glob`/grep evidence that proved it, skip steps 1–3, write a minimal landscape report (just the framed scope + open questions), and hand off to `spec [mode=draft]`. Run the step 5 scope gate ONLY if there is something to decide (e.g. two plausible buckets); with nothing to decide, default to NEW and state the assumption in one line.

---

## Workflow

### Step 0: Frame the Scope

Read the framed capability — the brainstorm / idea / requirement text that triggered this. Extract:

- **Keywords** — domain nouns and verbs the idea names (entities, actions, features).
- **Candidate entities / actors** — the business objects and roles the idea implies.
- **Target spec bucket** — which `<spec root>/{Bucket}/` the new spec would most likely live in — spec root default `docs/specs`; a `specRoots.business.path` entry in `docs/project-config.json` overrides the path (per the project's module mapping; resolve from `feature-spec-reference.md` / `spec-system-reference.md` in the project-reference docs root, default `docs/project-reference`, relocatable via `docsRoots.projectReference.path`).

State the framed scope in one line before continuing (e.g. `Discovering for: "bulk order export" — keywords [order, export, batch], bucket Orders`).

### Step 0.5: Declare the Discovery Wave

Step 1 (specs), Step 2 (code), and the invariant/test-case sweep read DIFFERENT inputs and produce DIFFERENT report sections — they are PAR. Running them one after another triples the wall time of the gate that stands between an idea and a duplicate spec, for zero safety gain. Declare the wave before Step 1, then spawn its members in ONE message:

| Wave-1 member                      | Scope (read-only)                                                                       | Route to                                                              | Feeds                                  |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Spec-corpus sweep**              | the `<spec root>/**` candidates the keywords touch (default `docs/specs`; `specRoots.business.path` in `docs/project-config.json` overrides it) — §1/§4/§5/§8 ONLY, never whole specs | one `investigate` per bucket when the corpus is large; inline for a small one | Related Specs · Affected Specs         |
| **Related-code discovery**         | the code the idea touches (the Step 2 delegation)                                        | `/investigate {keywords}` — or the supplied `--investigation=` report (no member spawned) | Related Code                           |
| **Invariant / test-case landscape** | [HARD] BRs (§4), §5 entity invariants, existing §8 TC coverage of the touched specs      | one `investigate`; fold into the corpus sweep when the corpus is small      | Invariant Landscape · Missing TCs      |

Rules binding this wave: each member owns a **unique artifact path** under `tmp/reports/spec-discovery-{slug}/`; no worker writes `spec-discovery-{slug}.md`. After the barrier, YOU are the sole reducer: read and validate every artifact, then synthesize the final report in section order. A missing artifact is rerun or reported, never silently replaced by a bounded summary.

**SEQ — keep these OUT of the wave (each names its blocker):** the optional Step 2 graph hint (YOU run it, and only after the code member returns its key files) · Step 3 gap & invariant reconciliation (consumes all three members) · the Step 5 scope-decision gate (a BLOCKING `AskUserQuestion` cannot block from inside a sub-agent) · Step 6 handoff.

Phase 0's corpus state shrinks the wave: **Specs only** → drop the code member · **Code only** → drop the corpus sweep · **Greenfield** → no wave at all (short-circuit).

### Step 1: Spec-Corpus Discovery

```bash
# Enumerate every canonical Feature Spec
ls docs/specs/**/README.*.md 2>/dev/null   # or: Glob docs/specs/**/README.*.md — docs/specs is the DEFAULT spec root; specRoots.business.path in docs/project-config.json overrides it
```

If NONE → record `No existing specs` and skip to Step 2.

Else, for each candidate spec the keywords touch, read the high-signal sections only (do NOT read whole specs — landscape, not deep-dive):

- **§1 Overview** — what the spec covers (scope boundary).
- **§4 Business-Rule headers** — the BR-{FC}-NN IDs and their [HARD]/[SOFT] tags (feeds invariant landscape).
- **§5 Domain Model** — entities + ERD (overlap detection by shared entities).
- **§8 Test-Case summary** — the TC count + summary table (coverage baseline; missing-TC detection).

Use the bucket `INDEX.md` (produced by `/spec [mode=index]`) as a fast navigation map when present — it lists the specs and their entities so you read fewer full files.

**Classify each candidate spec's relationship to the idea** (one label per spec, with `file:line` evidence):

| Relationship             | Meaning                                                                              |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **EXTENDS**              | The idea is a natural addition to this spec's capability — likely an UPDATE, not NEW. |
| **OVERLAPS (dup risk)**  | The idea re-states behavior this spec already owns — authoring NEW would duplicate.   |
| **DEPENDS-ON**           | The idea needs this spec's entities/rules to function — cross-reference required.     |
| **AFFECTED**             | The idea would change behavior this spec documents — forward-impact, may need amend.  |
| **UNRELATED**            | Shares a keyword but no real relationship — record to show it was checked.            |

### Step 2: Code-Logic Discovery (only if code exists)

Bridge the idea to the implementation so the spec reflects what actually exists (or what the idea will touch).

1. **Get the investigation.** When the caller passed `--investigation=<report path>` (an existing same-run investigate report that covers these keywords), read it and use its numbered, prioritized list as targets; delegate to `/investigate` ONLY for keyword slices the report does not cover. With no such input, **delegate to `/investigate {keywords}`** — fast parallel file discovery of the code the idea relates to. Either way, use investigate's list as targets and do NOT re-grep what it already mapped.
2. **Optional graph hint** — when grep and reading alone may not reveal a high-risk blast radius and `.code-graph/graph.db` exists, run graph commands YOURSELF (sub-agents do not) on 2–3 key files investigate surfaced; the graph can be stale or incomplete, so verify by reading:
    ```bash
    python .claude/scripts/code_graph trace <key-entity-or-command> --direction both --json
    python .claude/scripts/code_graph connections <key-file> --json
    ```
    The graph may surface callers, consumers, event chains, and tests grep misses — candidates for the downstream the new spec must account for; confirm each by reading.
3. **Delegate ambiguous areas to `/investigate`** — when investigate (plus any graph hint) surfaces a flow whose behavior is unclear (the idea hinges on how it works), hand that narrow slice to `investigate` rather than guessing.
4. **Bridge code → spec** — for each key code file, find its governing spec via the §8 `[Source: namespace/service/id]` anchors / Related Files. A code area with NO governing spec is a gap (record in Step 3); a code area WITH a governing spec strengthens the Step 1 relationship classification.

### Step 3: Gap & Invariant Analysis

From Steps 1–2, synthesize four lists (every item `file:line`-cited or marked "inferred"):

- **Missing features** — behavior the idea implies that NO existing spec or code covers. These are the net-new surface the spec must define.
- **Missing test cases / user stories** — in the specs the idea touches (EXTENDS/AFFECTED), the AC / TC the idea's behavior would require but that are absent today.
- **System unknowns** — anything the discovery could not resolve to >80% confidence (unverified flows, ambiguous ownership, unread cross-service consumers). Name each explicitly — an unknown surfaced is cheaper than a wrong spec.
- **Invariant landscape** — the existing [HARD] business rules (§4) and §5 entity invariants the idea must respect or might violate. This is the single most load-bearing output: a new spec that contradicts a [HARD] rule of a DEPENDS-ON spec ships a defect. List each invariant as "for ALL {inputs}, {invariant} holds — owned by {spec/BR-id}".

### Step 4: Report

Write `<plans root>/{plan-dir}/research/spec-discovery-{slug}.md` — plans root default `plans/`; a `docsRoots.plans.path` entry in `docs/project-config.json` overrides the path — (resolve `{plan-dir}` from the active plan; fall back to `tmp/reports/spec-discovery-{YYMMDD}-{HHmm}-{slug}.md`, a FIXED framework path, when no plan dir exists). Persist **incrementally** — append each section as it is produced, never hold the whole report in memory:

```markdown
# Spec-Discovery: {idea}

## Framed Scope
{keywords, candidate entities/actors, target bucket}

## Related Specs
| Spec | Relationship | Overlap evidence | Action implied |
| ---- | ------------ | ---------------- | -------------- |

## Related Code
{investigate's prioritized files + graph evidence — callers/consumers/tests}

## Affected Specs (forward-impact)
{specs whose documented behavior the idea would change}

## Gaps
- Missing features: ...
- Missing TCs / user stories: ...

## Invariant Landscape
- for ALL {inputs}, {invariant} — owned by {spec/BR-id} — idea must {respect/extend}

## Open Questions
- {system unknowns, <80% confidence items}
```

### Step 5: Scope-Decision Gate (BLOCKING `AskUserQuestion`)

> **MANDATORY MUST ATTENTION — NO EXCEPTIONS:** before any spec is authored, MUST ATTENTION use `AskUserQuestion` to present the recommended scope. NEVER auto-pick — OVERLAPS detection is the whole reason this skill exists; assuming NEW silently ships duplicates.

Recommend ONE option (with the evidence behind it) and confirm the cross-references:

- **(a) NEW standalone spec** — no EXTENDS/OVERLAPS match; the idea is genuinely net-new. Hand off to `spec [mode=draft]`.
- **(b) EXTEND existing spec X** — an EXTENDS/OVERLAPS match means the idea belongs inside X. **Reroute to `/spec [mode=update]`** against X instead of drafting a new file.
- **(c) SPLIT into N specs** — the idea spans N distinct capabilities (or would breach the size caps); author N specs, each with its own bucket.

Also confirm WHICH existing specs (the DEPENDS-ON / AFFECTED set) the author must cross-reference, so the new/updated spec links them and respects their invariants.

### Step 6: Handoff

Feed the discovery forward:

- **→ `domain-analysis`** — the related entities + invariant landscape (so the domain model is consistent with existing specs).
- **→ `spec [mode=draft]`** (or `spec [mode=update]` if Step 5 chose EXTEND) — the framed scope, the missing features/TCs, the cross-references to link, and the [HARD] rules to respect.

## Related Skills

`investigate` (code discovery and deep-dive ambiguous flows — Step 2) | `spec [mode=draft]` (authors §1–7 from the idea — Step 6 handoff) | `spec [mode=update]` (the EXTEND reroute — Step 5) | `domain-analysis` (entity/invariant modeling — Step 6) | `spec [mode=index]` (derived bucket INDEX.md used in Step 1)

> **[IMPORTANT]** Use `TaskCreate` to break ALL work into small tasks BEFORE starting — including a task per candidate spec read. This prevents context loss from long specs. For trivial single-spec scopes, AI MUST ATTENTION ask user whether to skip.

These three filenames resolve inside the project-reference docs root — default `docs/project-reference`; a `docsRoots.projectReference.path` entry in `docs/project-config.json` overrides the path.

- `feature-spec-reference.md` — Feature Spec conventions, bucket/module mapping (read before reading any spec).
- `spec-system-reference.md` — canonical vs derived spec artifacts, TC format, spec paths.
- `domain-entities-reference.md` — Domain entity catalog, relationships, cross-service sync (read when the idea involves business entities/models).

> **External Memory:** Complex/lengthy discovery → write findings incrementally to the research report. Prevents context loss.

> **Evidence Gate:** MANDATORY MUST ATTENTION — every relationship classification, gap, and invariant requires `file:line` proof with confidence % (>80% act, <80% verify first).

>
> 1. **Before starting:** Create report file `tmp/reports/{skill}-{date}-{slug}.md` and record Run ID, Task ID, Attempt ID, target scope, and target fingerprint. When visual artifacts are in scope, also record their ordered inventory and total; identify each screenshot, image, photo, or snapshot by path/name plus state and viewport when known.
> 2. **Checkpoint each review unit:** After each file or section, append findings, evidence, changed paths, and gaps immediately. For visual artifacts, open exactly ONE artifact, inspect it, and append its record BEFORE opening the next artifact. Each record includes artifact identity, state/viewport, inspection status, observations, severity-tagged issues with evidence, an explicit `none` when no issue exists, and any gap. NEVER batch multiple visual artifacts into one later write and never hold their findings in memory.
> 2a. **Resume from disk:** Treat the report's artifact records as the progress ledger. After interruption or context loss, read the report, derive processed and remaining artifacts from the ordered inventory, and continue at the first unprocessed artifact without duplicating completed records.
> 3. **Delegated return:** A sub-agent emits only the structured `SYNC:subagent-return-contract` envelope with exact totals, salient Critical/High findings (maximum ten), current attempt, and `Full report:` path. **Inline user-facing output:** Preserve the skill's requested explanation or teaching, with links to the persisted evidence; the delegated transport limit does not replace that deliverable. Do not paste a full review report into an envelope.
> 4. **Parent synthesis from persisted evidence:** The main agent reads the full report for synthesis, acceptance, deduplication, and repair planning — not only when a named blocker exists. For visual review, reconcile the ordered inventory against the artifact records before concluding; a missing record is incomplete review, never a clean result. Preserve all severities beyond the transport cap.
> 5. **Read-only boundary:** A read-only leaf may write its report/repair proposal but MUST NOT edit source, generated output, or user data; the parent/owner performs repairs after acceptance.
> 6. **Advancement gate:** The parent records `ACCEPTED` for the current Attempt ID only after reconciling target, totals, gaps, and changed paths; stale or late attempts cannot advance dependent work.
>
> **Why:** Context cutoff mid-execution loses ALL in-memory findings, and a large image set makes a final batch write especially fragile. Each per-unit disk write survives compaction. Partial results are better than no results, while explicit identity prevents a late result or a resumed image from being mistaken for the current run.

> The ten-bullet limit is a transport limit, not a visibility limit: the full report may contain more than ten Medium/Low findings when no named blocker exists, and the parent MUST read it when synthesizing or deduplicating. The parent MUST reject a stale, duplicate, or superseded `Attempt ID` and MUST accept the current attempt before advancing a dependent step. Read-only leaves write repair proposals/reports only; they do not edit source, generated carriers, or user files.
>
> **Context budget** — the return payload is a SUMMARY, not a transcript: no raw file contents / full diffs / verbatim logs inline, no re-pasted source. Everything beyond the envelope lives in the incrementally-written report. A sub-agent that would exceed the summary shape MUST persist the detail and return only the pointer; bounded transport must never become bounded visibility.

**Optional advice:** the code graph (`.code-graph/graph.db`) can hint at a high-risk blast radius grep misses; it can be stale, so verify by reading files. Never required.

- **MANDATORY** Bootstrap task tracking before target work; transition one task at a time.
- **MANDATORY** Persist plan/review findings to `tmp/reports/` incrementally and synthesize from disk.

## Prompt-Enhance Closing Anchors

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** follow declared step order for this skill; NEVER skip, reorder, or merge steps without explicit user approval
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** for every step/sub-skill call: set `in_progress` before execution, set `completed` after execution
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** every skipped step MUST include explicit reason; every completed step MUST include concise evidence
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** if Task tools unavailable, maintain an equivalent step-by-step plan tracker with synchronized statuses


## Closing Reminders

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION Goal:** Before a single line of a new Feature Spec is authored, deliver the pre-spec landscape — every existing Feature Spec the idea relates to / overlaps / depends on / would affect, the related code logic, the missing features and missing test cases / user stories, the system unknowns, and the invariant landscape the new spec must respect — so the author never ships a duplicate, contradicts a [HARD] rule, or specs into a blind spot.

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION Workflow:** Phase 0 classify the corpus and short-circuit when empty → declare the parallel discovery wave → Step 1 scan related specs → Step 2 discover related code and graph paths → Step 3 reconcile gaps and invariants → Step 4 persist the report → Step 5 obtain the blocking scope decision → Step 6 hand off to `domain-analysis` and `spec [mode=draft|update]`.

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION — Protocols in force (concise digest of the SYNC/shared blocks this skill carries; each is a signpost to its canonical body above):**

- **Graph-Assisted Investigation (optional):** the code graph is a stale-able hint for high-risk blast radius, never required.
- **Incremental Persistence:** Append findings to the research report, never hold the landscape in memory.
- **Subagent Return Contract:** Parallel-spec-read sub-agents return summary only, full findings on disk.
- **Nested Task Creation:** Expand child phases and link parent when nested under a workflow row.
- **Task Tracking External Report:** Bootstrap task tracking, persist discovery findings incrementally.
- **Evidence:** Cite `file:line`; speculation forbidden, <60% do not recommend.
- **Cross-Service Check:** Scan producers, consumers, sagas, contracts — a missed consumer the idea touches is a silent gap.
- **Rationalization Prevention:** Reject step-skipping evasions; show grep evidence.
- **Parallel Sub-Agent Dispatch:** Tag tasks PAR/SEQ, group PAR into disjoint-write-set waves, spawn each wave in ONE message, barrier before advancing.

**MUST ATTENTION** every protocol above is in force for this spec discovery — honor its canonical body, not just the digest line.

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** be BOTH spec-aware AND code-aware — read the spec root `<spec root>/**` (default `docs/specs`; `specRoots.business.path` in `docs/project-config.json` overrides it) (§1/§4/§5/§8 of related specs) AND delegate to `/investigate` (plus an optional code-graph hint); spec-only or code-only discovery misses half the landscape — why: overlap lives in the spec corpus, downstream impact lives in the code.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** run INLINE — the step 5 scope-decision gate is a BLOCKING `AskUserQuestion` that only works inline; spawn sub-agents only for parallel spec reads, NEVER delegate the whole skill — why: a delegated user gate cannot block, so the author would proceed before the user decides scope.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** NEVER auto-pick NEW — classify every candidate spec EXTENDS/OVERLAPS/DEPENDS-ON/AFFECTED/UNRELATED with `file:line` evidence, then recommend and let the user decide via the BLOCKING gate — why: OVERLAPS detection is the entire reason this skill runs before the author; silently picking NEW ships a duplicate spec.
**MUST ATTENTION** stay in the LANDSCAPE lane — surface related/overlapping/affected specs + the invariant landscape fast; do NOT author the spec (that is `spec [mode=draft]`) and do NOT deep-dive every flow (that is `investigate`) — why: scope creep into authoring/analysis duplicates the next steps and burns the budget.
**Optional advice:** for a high-risk blast radius grep may miss, a graph hint on 2–3 key files investigate surfaced can add callers/consumers/event chains — it may be stale; grep + read always bridge code→spec via `[Source:]` anchors — why: overlap lives in the spec corpus, downstream impact lives in the code.
**MUST ATTENTION** capture the invariant landscape explicitly — list every existing [HARD] rule (§4) and §5 invariant the idea must respect, as "for ALL {inputs}, {invariant} — owned by {spec/BR-id}" — why: a new spec that contradicts a DEPENDS-ON spec's [HARD] rule ships a defect.
**MUST ATTENTION** apply the greenfield short-circuit — when no specs AND no code, record the reason with `Glob`/grep evidence, skip heavy discovery, hand off a minimal landscape; run the scope gate only if there is something to decide — why: grinding through empty discovery wastes the budget and produces nothing.
**MUST ATTENTION** persist the report incrementally (per-section) to the research file — never hold the whole landscape in memory — why: context cutoff mid-discovery loses every finding; disk writes survive compaction.
**MUST ATTENTION** read required project docs first (always `lessons.md`; `feature-spec-reference.md` + `spec-system-reference.md` for spec conventions) BEFORE reading any spec — project conventions override generic assumptions.

**Anti-Rationalization:**

| Evasion                                          | Rebuttal                                                                          |
| ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "The idea is obviously new, skip the spec scan"  | OVERLAPS is exactly what the scan catches. Classify every candidate spec first.   |
| "No graph available, skip code discovery"        | Grep + read still bridge code→spec via `[Source:]` anchors. Discovery is required. |
| "I'll just guess the right scope"                | Step 5 is a BLOCKING user gate. NEVER auto-pick NEW — recommend, then let user decide. |
| "Spec corpus is huge, read just one spec"        | Glob ALL candidates the keywords touch; reading one hides the overlap in another. |
| "I'll author the draft while I'm here"           | Landscape only. Authoring is `spec [mode=draft]`; deep flow analysis is `investigate`. |
| "Invariants are the author's problem"            | A spec contradicting a [HARD] rule ships a defect. List the invariant landscape now. |
| "Delegate the whole skill to a sub-agent, faster"| The step 5 gate is BLOCKING and inline-only. Spawn sub-agents only for spec reads. |

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** spec-aware AND code-aware · INLINE (step 5 gate is BLOCKING) · NEVER auto-pick NEW — cite `file:line` with confidence >80% — these survive any long context, anchored top and bottom.

**[TASK-PLANNING]** Before acting, analyze task scope and systematically break it into small todo tasks and sub-tasks using TaskCreate.
