## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Detect user intent → auto-select direct/skill/standard/custom path → activate with full TaskCreate plan.

**Workflow:**

1. **Detect** — Execute explicit `/workflow-*` or `/start-workflow <id>` directly; otherwise match prompt against workflow catalog and skill list
2. **Auto-select** — Choose direct execution, a skill, a standard workflow, or a custom pipeline without asking the user to pick the path
3. **Activate** — Create ALL TaskCreate items for chosen sequence; materialize every declared `parallelGroups` group as a wave in those tasks; mark first `in_progress`

**Key Rules:**

- MUST ATTENTION define success criteria before execution and loop until observable verification passes.
- MUST ATTENTION when creating/reviewing specs or tests, name `Business Intent / Invariant Guarded` or the protected business intent/invariant and ensure the test would fail if that intent breaks.

- MUST ATTENTION auto-select the best execution path for ordinary prompts. Do not ask the user to choose between direct execution, skill, standard workflow, or custom workflow.
- Explicit `/workflow-*` or `/start-workflow <id>` invocation counts as the user choosing that workflow; execute it directly.
- Propose Custom Pipeline when no catalog workflow is a strong fit (>80% steps relevant = use catalog)
- `workflows.json` `workflows` field is an **OBJECT** — use `workflows[workflowId]`, NEVER `.find()` or `[index]`
- Create ALL `TaskCreate` items BEFORE marking the first task `in_progress` — batch creation, then execute
- Read `parallelGroups` at activation and tag its member tasks as one wave — 1:1 tasks still stand (a group never collapses members into one task)
- No `parallelGroups` = `sequence` is the order — surface only adjacent read-only steps as a `Candidate wave`, NEVER a wave that contradicts `sequence`
- NEVER mark a task `completed` without invoking its `Skill` tool, except when the selected canonical `preActions.injectContext` explicitly authorizes an evidence-backed conditional skip — use `in_progress` → cited comment → `completed`; never delete the task
- ALWAYS check context for `## Workflow Catalog` first (Tier 1). Tier 2 is mandatory before task creation only for `workflow-big-feature`, `workflow-bugfix`, and `workflow-feature` (to load their terminal refresh predicate), or when Tier 1 cannot supply required `parallelGroups` metadata — NEVER expose the full `workflows.json` to context
- If another workflow is active, it auto-switches (ends current, starts new) — no manual cleanup needed

**NOT for:** Manual step execution (follow TaskCreate items), workflow design (use `plan`), catalog management.

**Related:** `/start-workflow <workflowId>` | Catalog: host-specific static workflow-catalog surfaces derived from `.claude/workflows.json` (no router/tracker hooks)

## Custom Pipeline Option

When the prompt doesn't cleanly match a single catalog workflow — or combining steps from multiple workflows serves the request better — the AI MAY propose a **Custom Pipeline** alongside the catalog option.

### When to propose

| Condition                                    | Example                                                                              |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| No catalog workflow matches well             | "Review hook changes and update skill docs" — spans review + docs                    |
| Best-match has significant unnecessary steps | Quick investigate + fix, but `workflow-bugfix` includes full TDD + integration cycle |
| Prompt combines 2+ workflow domains          | "Audit performance and write integration tests for the slow query"                   |
| User explicitly requests a step sequence     | "Just run scout, plan, and feature-implement — nothing else"                         |

**Do NOT propose** when a catalog workflow is a strong match (>80% of its steps are relevant). Catalog workflows encode validated best-practice sequences — prefer them.

### How to build

1. **Valid steps only** — Use only canonical step ids — those appearing in workflow `sequence` arrays in `workflows.json` (each maps to a real `.claude/skills/<step>/SKILL.md` and is invoked as `/<step>`). No invented step names.
2. **Logical order** — Investigate → Plan → Implement → Test. Never reverse dependency order.
3. **Minimal** — Include only steps the prompt needs. No "just in case" additions.
4. **Name it** — Short descriptive name: "Quick Fix + Docs", "Audit + Test Coverage".

### How to present (AskUserQuestion format)

Show full step sequences for ALL options so the user compares scope:

```
Option A — Activate "Bug Fix" workflow (Recommended)
  Steps: /scout → /investigate → /debug-investigate → /plan → /fix → /prove-fix → /test → ...

Option B — Custom Pipeline: "Quick Fix + Docs"
  Steps: /scout → /investigate → /fix → /docs-update
  Rationale: Prompt targets a known location — full TDD cycle is over-engineered here.

```

**Rules:**

- Always show full step list per option
- One-sentence AI rationale for the custom pipeline
- Catalog workflow = "(Recommended)" unless custom pipeline confidence is clearly higher
- NEVER present custom pipeline as the only option — always include the catalog option
- For project-specific architecture, test, documentation, naming, or workflow rules, read `docs/project-config.json` and `docs/project-reference/docs-index-reference.md`; keep this reusable start-workflow protocol generic.

### Task creation for Custom Pipeline

Same 1:1 protocol — one `TaskCreate` per step. Use `[Custom]` prefix to distinguish from catalog tasks:

```
TaskCreate: subject="[Custom] {step-name} — {brief description}", description="Custom pipeline step N/{total}.", activeForm="Executing {step-name}"
```

## Workflow Lookup — Tier 1 Selection, Tier 2 Execution

Use Tier 1 to select every route. For the three policy-bound delivery workflows (`workflow-big-feature`, `workflow-bugfix`, and `workflow-feature`), use Tier 2 before TaskCreate to materialize their execution contract because static catalogs omit the terminal-refresh pre-action. Other workflows retain their existing Tier-1 task materialization unless `parallelGroups` metadata is required.

### Tier 1: Context (FREE — no file reads)

The workflow catalog is already present in static host context — derived into `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and Codex context rather than injected by a hook. Its headings and row grammar vary by host.

1. Search the available catalog surface for the exact workflow ID: `{workflowId}`.
2. Use its name and `whenToUse` summary only to confirm the route.
3. For `workflow-big-feature`, `workflow-bugfix`, and `workflow-feature`, do NOT parse a static catalog sequence or command syntax for TaskCreate; Tier 1 is route selection only. Other workflows retain their existing Tier-1 task materialization unless a Tier-2 `parallelGroups` read is required.

✅ Use Tier 1 for: route selection, and existing task materialization for workflows outside the policy-bound delivery set.
⚠️ Tier 2 is required immediately after selection and **before TaskCreate for only `workflow-big-feature`, `workflow-bugfix`, and `workflow-feature`**, plus any activation that needs canonical `parallelGroups`. The complete canonical entry loads `sequence`, `preActions.injectContext`, and `parallelGroups`.

### Tier 2: Complete Canonical Entry Read (JSON-aware)

After Tier 1 identifies a policy-bound delivery workflow or an activation needing `parallelGroups`, use this selected-entry read before creating tasks. For the three delivery workflows, the static catalog is a route-selection aid; the selected canonical entry remains the execution contract:

```
node .claude/scripts/codex/read-workflow-entry.mjs <workflowId>
```

This JSON-aware helper prints the complete `workflows[workflowId]` object only, including every sequence step even when the entry is long. It accepts the exact Tier-1-selected workflow ID as a data argument; it does not interpolate it into a shell command.
Parse: `sequence` array → step IDs, `preActions.injectContext`, and `parallelGroups` → invoke each with the active host's command syntax for that step.

### Tier 3: Missing Entry (stop)

If the JSON-aware lookup cannot return the exact selected entry, stop and report catalog drift or a missing canonical workflow. Do not fall back to a fixed-context grep, and do not expose the full file to context.

---

## After Activation — Task Creation Protocol (ZERO TOLERANCE)

**Active-goal resolution (BEFORE child task creation):** resolve the active Goal Contract per `SYNC:goal-contract-satisfaction-loop` — active plan `goal.md`, else `plans/goals/{YYMMDD-HHmm}-{slug}/goal.md`, else create one from the current user request using `.claude/templates/goal-contract-template.md`. Record the resolved goal path and pass it to every child step/sub-agent so the whole workflow executes against the same saved success criteria. The workflow may end only when the goal's Goal Satisfaction matrix passes or a blocker is escalated.

FIRST action after activation: create EXACTLY one `TaskCreate` for EACH entry in the workflow's `sequence` array.

### How to read `workflows.json` — CRITICAL SCHEMA

**`workflows.json` is a JSON OBJECT, not an array.** Most common AI mistake.

```
{
  "settings":       { ... },
  "workflows":      { <workflowId>: WorkflowEntry }   ← OBJECT, keyed by ID
}
```

**Lookup algorithm:**

```
workflow = workflows[workflowId]           // key lookup — NOT .find(), NOT [index]
steps    = workflow.sequence               // array of step ID strings
invocation = resolveActiveHostSyntax(stepId) // e.g. the active host's syntax for "scout"
```

**WorkflowEntry fields:**

| Field            | Type     | Notes                                                                                     |
| ---------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`           | string   | Display name                                                                              |
| `sequence`       | string[] | Ordered step IDs — SOLE source of truth                                                   |
| `whenToUse`      | string   | Natural language intent matching                                                          |
| `preActions`     | object   | Optional `injectContext` / `readFiles`                                                    |
| `parallelGroups` | object[] | Optional all-return barrier groups — `{id, members[], barrier:true, conditionalMembers[]}` |

**FORBIDDEN (common mistakes):**

```
// ❌ WRONG
workflows.find(w => w.id === workflowId)
workflows[0]

// ✅ CORRECT
workflows[workflowId]
Object.keys(workflows)   // list all IDs
```

### Task creation steps

1. **Tier 1 first (no file read):** search the available static catalog surface for `{workflowId}`. For workflows outside the policy-bound delivery set, use its established active-host sequence to create tasks unless canonical `parallelGroups` metadata is required.
2. **Tier 2 required before TaskCreate only for `workflow-big-feature`, `workflow-bugfix`, and `workflow-feature`, or when `parallelGroups` metadata is required:** `node .claude/scripts/codex/read-workflow-entry.mjs <workflowId>` → treat the complete selected entry's `sequence`, `preActions.injectContext`, and `parallelGroups` as canonical. If the static preview differs, stop and report catalog drift rather than choosing one silently.
3. **Apply delivery-workflow pre-actions to task context:** preserve the selected entry's `preActions.injectContext` as workflow-level execution context. For every conditional step it governs, put the exact run condition and evidence-backed skip transition in that task's description; never infer or drop a predicate because the static catalog rendered only a step name.
4. Create one `TaskCreate` per selected sequence step IN ORDER

> See **Workflow Lookup — Token-Efficient (3-Tier Strategy)** above for full lookup rules and fallback chain.

**Task format:**

```
TaskCreate: subject="[Workflow] {step-name} — {brief description}", description="Workflow step N/{total}. {conditional note}", activeForm="Executing {step-name}"
```

**Rules (NON-NEGOTIABLE):**

- **1:1 mapping** — each sequence entry = exactly one task. No consolidation, no invented tasks.
- **Conditional steps still get tasks** — add the exact canonical run condition and evidence-backed skip transition to the description; when the selected canonical `preActions.injectContext` authorizes that skip, it may complete without a Skill invocation after the cited comment. Never use a generic skip label.
- **Delivery-workflow pre-actions are mandatory execution input** — after Tier 1 selects `workflow-big-feature`, `workflow-bugfix`, or `workflow-feature`, Tier 2 must load `preActions.injectContext` before TaskCreate. A conditional step's task description must state its canonical run condition and evidence-backed skip transition.
- **Recursive self-calls get tasks** — e.g., `[Workflow] /workflow-review-changes — Recursive re-review (conditional)`
- **Count verification** — after creation: `task count == len(sequence)`. Fix mismatch before proceeding.

### Parallel waves from `parallelGroups` (compute at activation, BEFORE the first task runs)

A workflow MAY declare barrier groups in `parallelGroups` (schema: `.claude/workflows.schema.json` → `WorkflowEntry.parallelGroups`; live example: `workflow-review-changes`, groups `initial-reviews` and `reviewers`). Materialize each declared group as a wave IN THE TASK LIST, so the barrier is visible in the tasks and not only in prose.

1. **Read `parallelGroups` alongside `sequence`.** Tier 1 (`## Workflow Catalog` in `CLAUDE.md`) renders members FLAT and carries no group data. Tier 2's JSON-aware selected-entry lookup supplies `parallelGroups` with `sequence`.
2. **Expand any barrier token you were given.** The Codex mirrors (`AGENTS.md`, `.codex/CODEX_CONTEXT.md`) collapse a group into ONE `[parallel ⇉ all-return barrier: a, b*]` token (`*` = conditional member). That token is a barrier marker, NOT a step — expand it back to its member steps and create one task per member.
3. **Task count is still `len(sequence)`.** A group NEVER collapses its members into a single task; it only adds wave metadata to the member tasks.
4. **Tag each member task** — subject `[Workflow] [wave: {groupId}] /{step} — {brief description}`, description `Workflow step N/{total}. Parallel group '{groupId}' — spawned together with {other members}; barrier: advance only after ALL members return. {conditional note}`.
5. **Conditional members still get their own task** — add "Conditional — a skipped member still counts as returned for the barrier"; skip via `in_progress` → comment → `completed`, never delete.
6. **Execute a group as ONE wave** — spawn every member in ONE message, barrier on all returns, then advance to the first step after the group. That next step is a SEQ boundary: never start it — and never start any code-mutating step — while a member is still in flight.
7. **Malformed group → STOP, do not repair.** A member absent from `sequence`, a member in two groups, or `barrier ≠ true` means the workflow definition is broken: report it and run the sequence strictly in order rather than guessing the intended grouping.

### When a workflow declares NO `parallelGroups`

`sequence` is the source of truth. Absence of `parallelGroups` is NOT permission to invent groups.

- **NEVER** reorder, merge, drop, or co-schedule steps in any way that contradicts `sequence` — no self-authored wave may run a step ahead of a step that precedes it in `sequence`, and a workflow's fixed order overrides any independence you infer.
- **DO surface a candidate wave** when adjacent steps are obviously independent — ALL of: (a) contiguous in `sequence`, (b) read-only / report-producing (review, scan, investigation, research — each writes only its own `plans/reports/` file), (c) neither consumes the other's output. Announce it as `Candidate wave (not declared): [...]` and keep the 1:1 tasks unchanged.
- **NEVER** put in a candidate wave: any step that writes source files, any gate awaiting user approval, any step consuming a previous step's output, or any non-adjacent pair. When in doubt → run sequentially; a wrong wave silently reorders the workflow, a missed wave only costs time.
- **Persist what proves right** — if a candidate wave was correct, tell the user to add a `parallelGroups` entry to `.claude/workflows.json` (never edit it mid-run). An undeclared wave must never become the de-facto sequence.

Create ALL tasks first → then `TaskUpdate` first task to `in_progress`.

---

## Step Execution Protocol

Per required (non-skipped) step: `TaskUpdate in_progress` → **invoke `Skill` tool** → complete skill → `TaskUpdate completed`.

- Completing a task without invoking its `Skill` tool = **workflow violation**, except for a conditionally skipped task explicitly authorized by the selected canonical pre-action, which may complete without invoking its Skill tool after its cited comment
- Validation gates (`/plan-validate`, `/plan-review`, `/why-review`) MUST use explicit evidence and local project protocol — NEVER auto-approve inferred decisions. Explicit user approval in the prompt may satisfy the gate only when the gate's skill permits it.
- To skip a conditionally authorized step: `TaskUpdate in_progress` → cited comment "Skipped — {reason}" → `TaskUpdate completed` without invoking its Skill tool. Never delete.

---

## Workflow-in-Workflow Gate (HARD GATE)

Some workflow steps ARE themselves full workflows. The DEFAULT for a step that activates a multi-step workflow is sub-agent delegation — running it inline causes the parent session to absorb the entire nested workflow's tool calls, file reads, and sub-agent reports (context overflow on long sequences). The sub-agent runs the nested workflow in isolation and returns ONLY a `SYNC:subagent-return-contract` summary (full findings to `plans/reports/`).

**Default protocol (sub-agent delegation) for a nested-workflow step:**

1. NEVER invoke via inline `Skill` tool call
2. Spawn via `Agent` tool with the appropriate `subagent_type`
3. Agent prompt must include: current git diff context + feature/task description
4. Sub-agent runs the full nested workflow in its isolated context
5. Return ONLY SYNC:subagent-return-contract summary — write full findings to `plans/reports/`
6. Main agent reads `plans/reports/` file only when resolving specific blockers

**EXCEPTION — `workflow-review-changes` runs INLINE in the main session (never a sub-agent):**

| Step                       | Workflow activated        | Execution mode                  | Why                                                                                          |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/workflow-review-changes` | `workflow-review-changes` | **INLINE — main session agent** | Its Step 0 `/goal` gate binds the session Stop hook + its step-15 re-review is inline by design; a sub-agent cannot own the Stop hook, so delegating it silently breaks the unabandonable review→fix→re-review loop. Context stays bounded because its OWN step 2 and steps 4–10 reviewers are sub-agents writing to `plans/reports/`. |

When `/workflow-review-changes` appears in any workflow sequence (e.g. `workflow-feature`, `workflow-bugfix`, `workflow-refactor`), invoke it via the `Skill` tool INLINE — do NOT spawn it as an `Agent` sub-agent.

> The ⚠️ **[WORKFLOW-IN-WORKFLOW GATE]** is model-driven: apply it (default sub-agent, or the `workflow-review-changes` inline exception) yourself whenever the next step activates a nested workflow — no hook emits this warning.

## Closing Reminders

**Protocols in force (concise digest of the SYNC/shared blocks this skill carries):**

- **AI Mistake Prevention:** verify generated content against evidence, trace downstream references, verify all affected outputs, re-read after context loss, surface ambiguity.
- **Critical Thinking:** traced `file:line` proof, confidence >80%; NEVER present guess as fact.
- **Incremental Persistence:** append findings to report per file; NEVER hold in memory.
- **Sub-Agent Return Contract:** sub-agents return summary only; NEVER inline full output.
- **Parallel Sub-Agent Dispatch:** Tag tasks PAR/SEQ, group PAR into disjoint-write-set waves, spawn each wave in ONE message, barrier before advancing.

**MUST ATTENTION** auto-select the best path for ordinary prompts; explicit `/workflow-*` or `/start-workflow <id>` invocation executes directly. Do not ask for workflow-selection confirmation.
**MUST ATTENTION** `workflows` is an OBJECT — `workflows[workflowId]`, NEVER `.find()` / `[index]` / `.forEach()`
**MUST ATTENTION** create ALL `TaskCreate` items for the full sequence BEFORE marking the first task `in_progress`
**MUST ATTENTION** never mark a task `completed` without invoking its `Skill` tool, except an evidence-backed conditional skip explicitly authorized by selected canonical `preActions.injectContext` — cite comment + completed, never delete
**MUST ATTENTION** custom pipeline steps must be canonical step ids (each maps to a real `.claude/skills/<step>/SKILL.md`) — never invent step names
**MUST ATTENTION** use Tier 1 context selection FIRST, then Tier 2 JSON-aware complete canonical-entry read before TaskCreate only for `workflow-big-feature`, `workflow-bugfix`, `workflow-feature`, or an activation needing `parallelGroups` — load `sequence`, `preActions.injectContext`, and `parallelGroups`; never use fixed-context grep output
**MUST ATTENTION** materialize every declared `parallelGroups` group as a wave in the task list — one task per member, wave-tagged, spawned in ONE message, all-return barrier before the next step — why: a barrier that lives only in prose gets executed one step at a time
**MUST ATTENTION** no `parallelGroups` → `sequence` IS the order — never invent a group that contradicts it; only adjacent read-only steps may be surfaced as a `Candidate wave (not declared)` — why: a self-authored wave silently reorders a validated workflow, and that costs more than the time it saves

**[TASK-PLANNING]** Before acting, analyze task scope and systematically break it into small todo tasks and sub-tasks using TaskCreate.

> **[IMPORTANT]** Analyze how big the task is and break it into many small todo tasks systematically before starting — this is very important.
