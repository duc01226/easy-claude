## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Provide searchable UI/UX design intelligence -- 50 styles, 21 palettes, 50 font pairings, 20 charts, 8 stacks.

**Workflow:**

1. **Analyze** — Extract product type, style keywords, industry, and stack from user request
2. **Search** — Query `search.py` across domains: product, style, typography, color, landing, chart, UX
3. **Stack Guidelines** — Get stack-specific best practices (default: html-tailwind)
4. **Implement** — Synthesize search results into cohesive design and code

**Key Rules:**

- No emojis as UI icons (use SVG: Heroicons, Lucide, Simple Icons)
- All clickable elements need `cursor-pointer` and hover feedback
- Light mode text must have 4.5:1 minimum contrast ratio
- **Every async surface MUST handle all its states** — show a loading indicator while in-flight, a user-visible error (with retry) on failure, and a meaningful empty state when there's no data. Never a frozen blank, a silent failure, or a blank list.
- **Responsive by default** — layouts MUST stay usable on small devices. Preferred: reflow (rows `flex-wrap` or `row → column`, grids collapse to one column). Acceptable fallback when a layout genuinely can't reflow (tables, canvases, wide grids): fixed `min-width`/`min-height` + `overflow: auto` scroll — scrolling is OK. Hard minimum: nothing broken — no clipped, cut-off, or unreachable content. If small-screen support needs a refactor too big for the task, confirm scope with the user first.
- Test both light/dark modes, all UI states (loading/error/empty), and responsive breakpoints (320/768/1024/1440) before delivery

**Pre-read (project design system):** When the project has a design system, load `designSystem.canonicalDoc` + `tokenFiles` from `docs/project-config.json` and prefer project tokens/components over the generic style intelligence database.

**Be skeptical. Apply critical thinking, sequential thinking. Every claim needs traced proof, confidence percentages (Idea should be more than 80%).**

# UI/UX Pro Max - Design Intelligence

Searchable database of UI styles, color palettes, font pairings, chart types, product recommendations, UX guidelines, and stack-specific best practices.

## How to Use This Skill

When user requests UI/UX work (design, build, create, implement, review, fix, improve), follow this workflow:

### Step 1: Analyze User Requirements

Extract key information from user request:

- **Product type**: SaaS, e-commerce, portfolio, dashboard, landing page, etc.
- **Style keywords**: minimal, playful, professional, elegant, dark mode, etc.
- **Industry**: healthcare, fintech, gaming, education, etc.
- **Stack**: React, Vue, Next.js, or default to `html-tailwind`

### Step 2: Search Relevant Domains

Use `search.py` multiple times to gather comprehensive information. Search until you have enough context.

```bash
python .claude/skills/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py "<keyword>" --domain <domain> [-n <max_results>]
```

**Recommended search order:**

1. **Product** - Get style recommendations for product type
2. **Style** - Get detailed style guide (colors, effects, frameworks)
3. **Typography** - Get font pairings with Google Fonts imports
4. **Color** - Get color palette (Primary, Secondary, CTA, Background, Text, Border)
5. **Landing** - Get page structure (if landing page)
6. **Chart** - Get chart recommendations (if dashboard/analytics)
7. **UX** - Get best practices and anti-patterns
8. **Stack** - Get stack-specific guidelines (default: html-tailwind)

### Step 3: Stack Guidelines (Default: html-tailwind)

If user doesn't specify a stack, **default to `html-tailwind`**.

```bash
python .claude/skills/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py "<keyword>" --stack html-tailwind
```

Available stacks: `html-tailwind`, `react`, `nextjs`, `vue`, `svelte`, `swiftui`, `react-native`, `flutter`

## Example Workflow

**User request:** "Làm landing page cho dịch vụ chăm sóc da chuyên nghiệp"

**AI should:**

```bash
# 1. Search product type
python .claude/skills/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py "beauty spa wellness service" --domain product

# 2. Search style (based on industry: beauty, elegant)
python .claude/skills/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py "elegant minimal soft" --domain style

# 3. Search typography
python .claude/skills/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py "elegant luxury" --domain typography

# 4. Search color palette
python .claude/skills/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py "beauty spa wellness" --domain color

# 5. Search landing page structure
python .claude/skills/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py "hero-centric social-proof" --domain landing

# 6. Search UX guidelines
python .claude/skills/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py "animation" --domain ux
python .claude/skills/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py "accessibility" --domain ux

# 7. Search stack guidelines (default: html-tailwind)
python .claude/skills/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py "layout responsive" --stack html-tailwind
```

**Then:** Synthesize all search results and implement the design.

## Tips for Better Results

1. **Be specific with keywords** - "healthcare SaaS dashboard" > "app"
2. **Search multiple times** - Different keywords reveal different insights
3. **Combine domains** - Style + Typography + Color = Complete design system
4. **Always check UX** - Search "animation", "z-index", "accessibility" for common issues
5. **Use stack flag** - Get implementation-specific best practices
6. **Iterate** - If first search doesn't match, try different keywords

## Curation Constraints (UI/UX Design Principles)

The databases RECOMMEND; the 40 UI/UX Design Principles (`UI-1.1`–`UI-9.4`, the `SYNC:ui-ux-design-principles` block below) CONSTRAIN what you may recommend. A search hit is a CANDIDATE, not a verdict — verify it against the clauses before handing it to the user or to `design`. Project design-system docs outrank both the clauses and these databases; a genuine conflict goes to the user, NEVER resolved silently.

| Curated output | Clause constraint to satisfy BEFORE recommending it |
| --- | --- |
| **Palette** (`--domain color`, style palettes) | Measure the pairs you propose — text on background ≥4.5:1, UI edges/borders ≥3:1 (`UI-3.1`) — and report the measured ratio; never "looks fine". Keep ONE accent with one job (`UI-3.2`); never let colour carry status meaning alone — pair it with an icon or label (`UI-3.3`). A dark variant lifts surfaces for elevation and softens pure-white text; it is NOT the light palette inverted (`UI-3.4`). |
| **Font pairing** (`--domain typography`) | At most 2 families × 3 weights (`UI-2.1`) — a pairing needing a third family is over-curated. Body renders 16px web / 17px mobile and NEVER below 14px for readable content (`UI-2.2`); measure 45–75 characters (`UI-2.3`); leading 1.5 body, 1.1–1.2 display (`UI-2.4`). Deliver the pairing AS a 6-step named type scale, not a loose list of sizes (`UI-2.5`). |
| **Style / product recommendation** (`--domain style`, `--domain product`) | The style must still permit ONE focal point per screen (`UI-1.1`) and grouping by whitespace rather than nested boxes (`UI-1.3`). Reject or adapt any aesthetic that requires removing the focus ring (`UI-5.5`), hiding labels behind placeholders (`UI-7.2`), or motion outside 150–250ms ease-out that ignores reduced-motion (`UI-5.4`). |
| **Spacing / layout guidance** (`--domain style`, stack guidelines) | Express spacing as ONE unit multiplied — 4px or 8px base, every gap a multiple (`UI-4.1`) — owned by the container via a gap property (`UI-4.2`), tighter inside than between groups (`UI-4.3`); breakpoints follow the content, not device names (`UI-4.4`). |
| **Any UI handed off or built from this intelligence** | Empty, loading and error states specified FIRST, before the populated state (`UI-1.5`), with space reserved so loaded content never shifts the layout (`UI-9.3`); all 5 interaction states enumerated per interactive element — default, hover, focus, active, disabled — plus loading where it applies (`UI-5.2`); on mobile/touch surfaces hit targets ≥44×44pt and 8px apart (`UI-8.1`) with primary actions in the bottom third (`UI-8.2`). |

**When a curated recommendation cannot satisfy a clause,** say so explicitly with the clause ID and offer the compliant alternative — a beautiful palette that fails `UI-3.1` is a FINDING, not a deliverable.

## Common Rules for Professional UI

These are frequently overlooked issues that make UI look unprofessional:

### Icons & Visual Elements

| Rule                       | Do                                              | Don't                                  |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **No emoji icons**         | Use SVG icons (Heroicons, Lucide, Simple Icons) | Use emojis like 🎨 🚀 ⚙️ as UI icons   |
| **Stable hover states**    | Use color/opacity transitions on hover          | Use scale transforms that shift layout |
| **Correct brand logos**    | Research official SVG from Simple Icons         | Guess or use incorrect logo paths      |
| **Consistent icon sizing** | Use fixed viewBox (24x24) with w-6 h-6          | Mix different icon sizes randomly      |

### Interaction & Cursor

| Rule                   | Do                                                    | Don't                                        |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Cursor pointer**     | Add `cursor-pointer` to all clickable/hoverable cards | Leave default cursor on interactive elements |
| **Hover feedback**     | Provide visual feedback (color, shadow, border)       | No indication element is interactive         |
| **Smooth transitions** | Use `transition-colors duration-200`                  | Instant state changes or too slow (>500ms)   |

### Light/Dark Mode Contrast

| Rule                      | Do                                  | Don't                                   |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Glass card light mode** | Use `bg-white/80` or higher opacity | Use `bg-white/10` (too transparent)     |
| **Text contrast light**   | Use `#0F172A` (slate-900) for text  | Use `#94A3B8` (slate-400) for body text |
| **Muted text light**      | Use `#475569` (slate-600) minimum   | Use gray-400 or lighter                 |
| **Border visibility**     | Use `border-gray-200` in light mode | Use `border-white/10` (invisible)       |

### Layout & Spacing

| Rule                     | Do                                  | Don't                                  |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Floating navbar**      | Add `top-4 left-4 right-4` spacing  | Stick navbar to `top-0 left-0 right-0` |
| **Content padding**      | Account for fixed navbar height     | Let content hide behind fixed elements |
| **Consistent max-width** | Use same `max-w-6xl` or `max-w-7xl` | Mix different container widths         |

### Async UI States & Feedback (the most-missed fundamentals)

> **Every screen or component that fetches, submits, or mutates data MUST render all of its states — not just the happy path.** A UI that looks perfect when populated but shows a frozen blank while loading, fails silently on error, or shows nothing when empty is broken UX. Canonical state vocabulary (shared with `design-spec`): **Default / Loading / Disabled / Error / Empty / Success**.

| State                    | Do                                                                                 | Don't                                                        |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Loading**              | Show a spinner / skeleton / progress while any request is in-flight                | Leave a frozen or blank screen; block the whole page silently |
| **Error**                | Show a human-readable message with a retry / recovery action                       | Fail silently, swallow the error, or dump a raw stack trace / JSON |
| **Empty**                | Show a meaningful empty state (illustration/message + optional CTA)                | Render a blank area when a list/table has zero items        |
| **In-flight / disabled** | Disable the submit/action button (or show it busy) while its request runs          | Allow double-submit by leaving the trigger active           |
| **Success**              | Confirm completion (toast / inline / visibly updated data)                         | Complete a mutation with no acknowledgment to the user      |

### Responsive & Multi-Device (usable on small screens)

| Rule                        | Do                                                                          | Don't                                                        |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Rows reflow**             | `flex-wrap: wrap` or switch `flex-direction: row → column` at small widths  | Fixed `flex-direction: row` that overflows on a phone       |
| **Grids collapse**          | Multi-column grids collapse to one column on small screens                  | Fixed column counts / track widths that never collapse      |
| **Scroll fallback OK**      | Can't reflow (table/canvas/wide grid)? Fixed `min-width`/`min-height` + `overflow: auto` — scrolling is fine | Content clipped, cut off, or a control unreachable off-screen with no scroll path |
| **Fluid over fixed**        | `min/max-width`, `flex-grow`, `%`/`rem` sizing                              | Large fixed px widths on containers/cards/dialogs           |
| **Big refactor → confirm**  | Small-screen support needs a large layout rewrite → flag it, confirm scope with the user | Silently rewriting a big layout, or shipping it broken on small screens |

## Pre-Delivery Checklist

Before delivering UI code, verify these items:

### Visual Quality

- [ ] No emojis used as icons (use SVG instead)
- [ ] All icons from consistent icon set (Heroicons/Lucide)
- [ ] Brand logos are correct (verified from Simple Icons)
- [ ] Hover states don't cause layout shift

### Interaction

- [ ] All clickable elements have `cursor-pointer`
- [ ] Hover states provide clear visual feedback
- [ ] Transitions are smooth (150-300ms)
- [ ] Focus states visible for keyboard navigation

### States & Feedback (async surfaces — verify every one)

- [ ] **Loading** — every data fetch / submit / mutation shows a spinner or skeleton while in-flight (never a frozen blank screen)
- [ ] **Error** — every operation that can fail shows a human-readable error with a retry / recovery path (no silent failure, no raw stack trace)
- [ ] **Empty** — every list / table / collection view has a meaningful empty state (message + optional CTA), not a blank area
- [ ] **In-flight disable** — submit/action buttons are disabled or busy while their request runs (no double-submit)
- [ ] **Success** — completed mutations give confirmation feedback (toast / inline / updated data)

### Light/Dark Mode

- [ ] Light mode text has sufficient contrast (4.5:1 minimum)
- [ ] Glass/transparent elements visible in light mode
- [ ] Borders visible in both modes
- [ ] Test both modes before delivery

### Layout & Responsiveness

- [ ] Floating elements have proper spacing from edges
- [ ] No content hidden behind fixed navbars
- [ ] Responsive at 320px, 768px, 1024px, 1440px
- [ ] Rows `flex-wrap` or switch `row → column` on small screens; multi-column grids collapse to one column
- [ ] Usable down to 320px — **nothing broken** (no clipped, cut-off, or unreachable content); where a layout genuinely can't reflow, a `min-width`/`min-height` + `overflow: auto` scroll is acceptable
- [ ] Any small-screen fix that needs a large layout refactor was flagged and confirmed with the user (not silently rewritten)

### Accessibility

- [ ] All images have alt text
- [ ] Form inputs have labels
- [ ] Color is not the only indicator
- [ ] `prefers-reduced-motion` respected

<!-- SYNC:ui-ux-design-principles -->

> **UI/UX Design Principles (Rev 1.0 — 40 clauses, web + mobile)** — the working rule set for ANY task that designs, plans, implements, or reviews a user interface. Applies to BOTH platforms unless a clause names one (§8 is mobile/touch). Cite clauses by ID: `UI-3.1`, `UI-8.2`.
>
> **Precedence:** project design-system / SCSS / frontend-pattern docs OUTRANK these clauses; these clauses outrank generic taste. A genuine conflict is SURFACED to the user with both sides — NEVER resolved silently. — why: the project's own recorded decision is the authority; these clauses are the default when it is silent.
>
> **1.0 Visual Hierarchy & Layout**
>
> - `UI-1.1` One focal point per screen. Two elements competing for first read → demote one.
> - `UI-1.2` Signal order: size → weight → colour → position. Use the cheapest signal that works before adding another.
> - `UI-1.3` Group by proximity, NEVER by border. Whitespace separates cleanly; boxes inside boxes do not.
> - `UI-1.4` Align to a shared edge. Every unexplained indent reads as an accident.
> - `UI-1.5` Design the empty, loading and error state FIRST. The full state is the easy one.
>
> **2.0 Typography**
>
> - `UI-2.1` Max 2 families, 3 weights each. More variety reads as inconsistency, not range.
> - `UI-2.2` Body text 16px web, 17px mobile. NEVER below 14px for anything a user must read.
> - `UI-2.3` Line length 45–75 characters. Constrain the measure, not the container.
> - `UI-2.4` Leading scales inversely with size: 1.5 body, 1.1–1.2 display.
> - `UI-2.5` Fixed type scale — 6 named steps shared with engineering. NEVER one-off sizes.
>
> **3.0 Colour & Contrast**
>
> - `UI-3.1` Contrast 4.5:1 text, 3:1 UI edges. Measure it — NEVER judge by eye on a bright screen.
> - `UI-3.2` One accent, one job. An accent that is everywhere points at nothing.
> - `UI-3.3` Colour NEVER carries meaning alone — pair it with an icon, label or position.
> - `UI-3.4` Dark mode is NOT inverted light mode. Lift surfaces to signal elevation; soften pure-white text.
>
> **4.0 Spacing & Grid**
>
> - `UI-4.1` One spacing unit, multiplied — 4px or 8px base; every gap a multiple of it.
> - `UI-4.2` Space belongs to the container, not the child. Use `gap`; reserve margins for exceptions.
> - `UI-4.3` Tighter inside, looser between — inner padding always smaller than the gap to the next group.
> - `UI-4.4` Breakpoints follow content, not devices. Break where the layout stops working.
>
> **5.0 Interaction & Feedback**
>
> - `UI-5.1` Every action gets a response under 100ms, even when the result takes longer.
> - `UI-5.2` Specify all 5 states — default, hover, focus, active, disabled — plus loading where it applies.
> - `UI-5.3` Prefer undo over confirmation. Confirm ONLY what cannot be reversed.
> - `UI-5.4` Motion clarifies cause and effect: 150–250ms, ease-out, honours reduced-motion.
> - `UI-5.5` Keep the visible focus ring. Restyle it if it clashes; NEVER remove it.
>
> **6.0 Navigation & IA**
>
> - `UI-6.1` Every screen answers: where am I, what's here, where next.
> - `UI-6.2` Max 5 top-level destinations. Depth beats a crowded first level.
> - `UI-6.3` Label by the user's word, not the internal one. Team vocabulary is not a taxonomy.
> - `UI-6.4` Every state deserves a URL or a back path. Deep links and hardware back must land somewhere sensible.
>
> **7.0 Forms & Input**
>
> - `UI-7.1` Ask for less. Every field needs a reason it exists today.
> - `UI-7.2` Labels stay visible. Placeholders are hints, NEVER labels.
> - `UI-7.3` Validate on blur, not on keystroke. Errors sit next to the field and say how to fix it.
> - `UI-7.4` Match keyboard to data type — correct input type, autocomplete and autocapitalise on every field.
> - `UI-7.5` NEVER lose entered data. Preserve input across errors, navigation and refresh.
>
> **8.0 Mobile & Touch** _(mobile/touch surfaces)_
>
> - `UI-8.1` Hit target ≥44×44pt, 8px apart. The target may exceed the visible icon.
> - `UI-8.2` Primary actions in the bottom third — that is where the thumb lives.
> - `UI-8.3` Gestures are shortcuts, NEVER the only route. Anything swipeable is also tappable.
> - `UI-8.4` Respect safe areas and the keyboard. Notch, home indicator and on-screen keyboard all steal space.
>
> **9.0 Speed & Perceived Speed**
>
> - `UI-9.1` Show structure before data — skeletons for known layouts, spinners only for unknown waits.
> - `UI-9.2` Assume success optimistically. Update UI first, reconcile after, roll back visibly on failure.
> - `UI-9.3` Reserve space for anything that loads. Images, ads and fonts must NEVER shift the layout.
> - `UI-9.4` Design for the slow connection. Offline, timeout and retry are states, NOT edge cases.
>
> **Apply by role** — the clauses are one set; what you DO with them depends on the task:
>

> **AI Mistake Prevention** — Failure modes to avoid on every task:
>
> **Re-read files after context changes.** Context compaction, resume, or long-running work can make memory stale; verify current files before acting.
> **Verify generated content against source evidence.** AI hallucinates APIs, names, claims, and document facts. Check the relevant source before documenting or referencing.
> **Check downstream references before deleting or renaming.** Removing an artifact can stale docs, generated mirrors, configs, and callers; map references first.
> **Trace the full impact chain after edits.** Changing a definition can miss derived outputs and consumers. Follow the affected chain before declaring done.
> **Verify ALL affected outputs, not just the first.** One green check is not all green checks; validate every output surface the change can affect.
> **Assume existing values are intentional — ask WHY before changing OR flagging one as a defect.** Before changing or reporting a constant, limit, flag, cutoff, wording, or pattern, read nearby context and history, the CALLER's ordering, and 2+ sibling call sites of the same convention. A doc stating WHAT without WHY is missing rationale, not proof of a missing guard.
> **Surface ambiguity before acting — don't pick silently.** Multiple valid interpretations require an explicit question or stated assumption with risk.
> **Assert the outcome your system owns, not the intermediate state your infrastructure owns.** When verifying async work, assert the final business state — never the delivery/retry bookkeeping held in shared infrastructure that any co-running process can write. Such a check passes when run alone and flakes the moment anything else shares that infrastructure.
> **Keep shared guidance role-relevant.** Universal guidance must help every receiving skill or agent; code-specific obligations belong only in code-specific protocols.

- **MUST ATTENTION** apply the 40 UI/UX Design Principles (`UI-1.1`–`UI-9.4`) to any user-facing surface: one focal point, proximity grouping, empty/loading/error designed FIRST (§1) · ≤2 families, 16px web / 17px mobile body, never <14px, 45–75ch, fixed 6-step scale (§2) · 4.5:1 text / 3:1 edges measured, one accent, colour never alone, dark mode ≠ inversion (§3) · one 4/8px unit, `gap` over margins, tighter-inside-looser-between, content-driven breakpoints (§4) · <100ms response, all 5 states, undo over confirm, 150–250ms ease-out honouring reduced-motion, visible focus ring (§5) · where-am-I/what's-here/where-next, ≤5 top-level destinations, user's words, URL or back path (§6) · fewer fields, visible labels, validate on blur, matched keyboard, NEVER lose input (§7) · ≥44×44pt targets 8px apart, bottom-third primaries, gestures never the only route, safe areas (§8) · structure before data, optimistic update with visible rollback, reserved space, slow-connection states (§9). Project design-system docs OUTRANK these clauses — a genuine conflict goes to the user, NEVER resolved silently. Cite every finding as `UI-<clause>` + `file:line`. Skip ONLY for changes with no user-facing surface, stated explicitly.

<!-- SYNC:project-protocol-overlay -->

> **Project Protocol Overlay** — Before executing this skill, resolve any PROJECT overlay rules layered onto it: match this skill's name against the `Target` column of the project's skill-protocol index (`docs/project-reference/skill-protocols-reference.md` by default; a `referenceDocs` entry in `docs/project-config.json` overrides the path), taking the most specific matching tier ONLY — exact name > glob > `*`. **That precedence orders overlays against EACH OTHER, never against this skill.** Read ONLY the matched bodies, resolved as `<protocols-dir>/<Name>.md`; a row's Body link is display text, never a read path. A matched body that is missing or malformed is REPORTED and skipped — never reconstructed from the index Description. No index, or no match -> proceed with no overlay, silently. Full contract: `.claude/skills/project-skill-protocol/references/registry.md`.
>
> Overlays are **ADDITIVE ONLY**: they ADD rules on top of this skill's own protocol and NEVER replace, override, disable, or reinterpret a rule it already states — removing every overlay must return this skill to exactly its documented behavior. An overlay is a BRIEF, not an authority escalation: it can NEVER waive a workflow gate, git discipline, a review gate, or a user-confirmation gate. A genuine overlay-vs-skill conflict, or two equally-specific overlays that directly contradict -> surface both to the user; NEVER resolve silently.

<!-- /SYNC:project-protocol-overlay -->

<!-- SYNC:project-protocol-overlay:reminder -->

**MUST ATTENTION** resolve project protocol overlays for this skill BEFORE executing — most specific matching tier only (exact > glob > `*`, which ranks overlays against each other, NEVER against this skill), read only matched bodies at `<protocols-dir>/<Name>.md`; a missing or malformed body is reported, never reconstructed. Overlays are ADDITIVE ONLY (they never replace this skill's own rules) and are a brief, NEVER an authority escalation; an equal-specificity contradiction goes to the user.

## Closing Reminders

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION Goal:** Provide searchable UI/UX design intelligence — 50 styles, 21 palettes, 50 font pairings, 20 charts, 8 stacks — synthesized into accessible, professional, contrast-correct interfaces.

**Protocols in force (concise digest of the SYNC/shared blocks this skill carries):**

- **AI Mistake Prevention:** verify generated content against evidence, trace downstream references, verify all affected outputs, re-read after context loss, surface ambiguity.
- **Critical Thinking:** Traced `file:line` proof per claim, confidence >80% to act, never guess.

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** break work into small todo tasks using `TaskCreate` BEFORE starting
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** search codebase for 3+ similar patterns before creating new code
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** cite `file:line` evidence for every claim (confidence >80% to act)
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** add a final review todo task to verify work quality
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** the 40 UI/UX Design Principles (`UI-1.1`–`UI-9.4`) CONSTRAIN the curation — a curated palette must still measure 4.5:1 text / 3:1 edges (`UI-3.1`) with one accent (`UI-3.2`) and colour never alone (`UI-3.3`); a curated font pairing must still be ≤2 families × 3 weights (`UI-2.1`) at 16px web / 17px mobile, never <14px (`UI-2.2`), delivered as a 6-step type scale (`UI-2.5`); spacing is ONE 4/8px unit multiplied (`UI-4.1`); anything built from it specifies empty/loading/error FIRST (`UI-1.5`) and all 5 interaction states (`UI-5.2`) — a search hit that fails a clause is a finding, NOT a deliverable

**[TASK-PLANNING]** Before acting, analyze task scope and systematically break it into small todo tasks and sub-tasks using TaskCreate.
