## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Synthesize every session-generated idea, Feature Spec, PBI, user story, design-spec, and mockup into ONE standalone HTML slide deck for PO/BA/Dev/QC — project-faithful styling, an interactive MVP demo of every main user journey, vanilla-JS slide engine — so the whole team reviews the feature from a single offline file before build.

**Summary:**

- This is a SYNTHESIS deck at a different altitude than `pbi-mockup`: it accumulates many artifacts (ideas + specs + PBIs + stories + design-specs + mockups) into one stakeholder presentation, not one PBI's UI preview.
- Output is exactly ONE self-contained HTML file at `team-artifacts/presentations/{YYMMDD}-presentation-{slug}.html` — inline CSS/JS, Google Fonts only, NO CDN (no reveal.js); a ~60-line vanilla-JS slide engine (keyboard ←/→/Home/End, nav dots, counter, light/dark toggle).
- Every in-scope main user story is presented as an **interactive MVP demo slide** ("click X → see Y → move to Z") with a plain-language narration strip — planned as an ordered journey list (Step 5, one todo per journey) and signed off by a final Demo-Quality review (Step 8b); a "How to drive this demo" guide slide sits near the top.
- Mockups are REUSED, never regenerated: each existing `team-artifacts/pbis/*-mockup.html` (now interactive) is embedded via `<iframe srcdoc="…entity-escaped…">` — escaping rule in `references/deck-template.md`. The mock-up is self-driving; the deck adds only narration.
- Spec-only `idea-to-spec` degrades to design-spec visuals (ASCII wireframes + inventory/states/tokens tables) and a narrated step-through of ASCII frames — NO HTML mockups, NO `pbi-mockup` invocation — preserving the spec-only contract. Full HTML mockups appear only in `idea-to-pbi` context.

**Workflow:**

1. **Resolve scope** — anchor on `activePlan`, accumulate its full artifact set across the plan's created→now date range (every `{YYMMDD}` in range, NOT just today); custom prompt widens; standalone + no prompt → `AskUserQuestion`.
2. **Gap-fill (smart routing — sub-agent)** — spec lacks PBIs → `workflow-spec-to-pbi` AS A SUB-AGENT; PBIs lack mockups (mockup-bearing workflow) → `pbi-mockup`. Spec-only `idea-to-spec` → SKIP mockup generation.
3. **Load project design context** — baseline + matched per-app design-system docs via `project-config.json`.
4. **[BLOCKING] Inventory existing UI + map connected flows** — `SYNC:existing-ui-research`.
5. **Accumulate + structure content (incl. journey extraction)** — parse each artifact into stakeholder sections; extract the main-story flows into an ordered journey list + `TaskCreate` one todo per journey; REAL domain data, never Lorem (`references/artifact-accumulation.md`).
6. **Assemble ONE standalone HTML deck** — inline CSS (design tokens, BEM) + vanilla-JS engine + a "How to drive this demo" guide slide + one interactive demo-flow slide per journey (embedded mockup + narration strip) + `<iframe srcdoc>` mockup embeds; spec-only path renders ASCII/tables + narrated ASCII frames; empty-state slide when no visual exists (`references/deck-template.md`).
7. **Save** → `team-artifacts/presentations/{YYMMDD}-presentation-{slug}.html`.
8. **[BLOCKING] Fidelity gate (incl. demo integrity)** — validate deck visuals + every journey clicks through vs Step 4 inventory; record `Fidelity vs existing UI: PASS|FAIL` (`references/deck-template.md`).
8b. **[BLOCKING] Demo-Quality review** — final stakeholder-comprehension pass; record `Demo quality: PASS|FAIL`.
9. **Report** — path, artifact count synthesized, demo journeys, stakeholder sections, fidelity + demo-quality verdicts.

**Key Rules:**

- Emit exactly ONE self-contained HTML file; inline CSS/JS; no external `<script src>` / `<link rel=stylesheet>` except Google Fonts; no CDN reveal.js — vanilla-JS engine only.
- Present every in-scope main user story as an interactive MVP demo slide (embedded interactive mockup + narration strip); plan journeys first (Step 5, one todo each), sign off with the Demo-Quality review (Step 8b).
- Embed existing `-mockup.html` via `<iframe srcdoc>` — never regenerate a mockup that already exists; the mock-up is self-driving, the deck adds only narration.
- Spec-only `idea-to-spec` → design-spec ASCII wireframes + inventory/states/tokens tables + narrated ASCII-frame step-through ONLY; never generate HTML mockups, never invoke `pbi-mockup`.
- Use REAL domain entity field names + realistic sample data — never Lorem ipsum or "Item 1, Item 2".
- Empty-state slide when an in-scope feature has no mockup AND no design-spec — never a broken/blank iframe.
- Run gap-fill multi-step workflows as SUB-AGENTS (summary returned + findings written to `plans/reports/`) per CLAUDE.md "Workflow Step Advancement §3".
- Keep accompanying prose/captions tech-agnostic (business/observable terms, not framework/CSS class names); the rendered HTML may use real class names internally.

**Be skeptical. Apply critical thinking, sequential thinking. Every claim needs traced proof, confidence percentages (Idea should be more than 80%).**

# Feature Presentation — Stakeholder HTML Slide Deck

Synthesize all session-generated specs, PBIs, ideas, and mockups into one standalone HTML slide presentation for PO/BA/Dev/QC.

---

## When to Use

- Near the end of `workflow-idea-to-pbi` and `workflow-idea-to-spec`, to present the whole feature set to stakeholders.
- Standalone, when a PO/BA/Dev/QC needs one offline deck synthesizing a feature's ideas, specs, PBIs, stories, and mockups.

**NOT for**: Generating a single PBI's UI preview (use `/pbi-mockup`), authoring a Feature Spec (use `/spec`), or producing a design spec (use `/design-spec`).

## Detailed Workflow

### Step 1: Resolve Scope

Determine which artifacts the deck synthesizes. See `references/artifact-accumulation.md` → "Scope Resolution" for the full algorithm.

1. **Default (active-plan anchor):** Read `activePlan` from `/tmp/ck-session-{id}.json` (set by `.claude/scripts/set-active-plan.cjs`). Accumulate the plan's FULL artifact set across the plan's **created→now date range** — glob `team-artifacts/{ideas,pbis,pbis/stories,design-specs}` and `*-mockup.html` for EVERY `{YYMMDD}` in that range, plus the plan's `docs/specs` outputs.
    - **Multi-day rule:** a workflow that spans midnight authors specs on day 1 and PBIs on day 2 — a single-day `{YYMMDD}` glob silently drops day-1 artifacts. Glob over the whole created→now range, never just today.
2. **Custom prompt:** If the user names specs/features, widen scope to those named artifacts (plus their dependents).
3. **Standalone + no prompt:** Use `AskUserQuestion` to ask which specs/ideas to present — never silently guess scope.

### Step 2: Gap-Fill (Smart Routing — Sub-Agent)

Fill missing downstream artifacts so the deck is complete. See `references/artifact-accumulation.md` → "Gap-Fill Routing".

1. **Spec lacks PBIs:** Invoke `workflow-spec-to-pbi` **AS A SUB-AGENT** (Agent tool) — per CLAUDE.md "Workflow Step Advancement §3", a step that activates a multi-step workflow MUST run as a sub-agent: it returns only a summary and writes full findings to `plans/reports/`. This keeps the deck-build context bounded.
2. **PBIs lack `-mockup.html` AND the workflow is mockup-bearing (`idea-to-pbi`):** Invoke `pbi-mockup` per PBI to generate the missing mockup.
3. **Spec-only `idea-to-spec` context:** SKIP all mockup generation — never invoke `pbi-mockup`. The deck will use design-spec visuals only (Step 6 spec-only path). This preserves the `idea-to-spec` no-mockup contract.

### Step 3: Load Project Design Context

The deck CSS must use the project's design tokens (same discovery as `pbi-mockup`):

1. **Mandatory baseline:** Read `docs/project-reference/design-system/README.md` and `docs/project-reference/design-system/design-system-canonical.md`.
2. **Primary:** Read top-level `designSystem` in `docs/project-config.json` — use `designSystem.docsPath` + `designSystem.canonicalDoc`, then match the presented feature/app context against `designSystem.appMappings[]` to select the per-app doc.
3. **Fallback:** `Glob("docs/project-reference/design-system/*.md")` → case-insensitive substring match on app/feature name. **Default:** `README.md`.
4. Extract colors, typography, spacing, border-radius, shadows → these become the deck's CSS variables.

### Step 4: [BLOCKING] Inventory Existing UI + Map Connected Flows

> **[BLOCKING] Do NOT assemble the deck until this inventory + connected-flow map is done** (canonical: `SYNC:existing-ui-research`). The deck must faithfully match the current UI system, not generic HTML.

1. Read `docs/project-reference/frontend-patterns-reference.md` (first 200 lines) — base component classes, form/table/dialog patterns.
2. Sample 2-3 real shared/module components for layout patterns and CSS class naming.
3. Map the connected feature flows the presented features link to/from, so the deck's embedded visuals fit the surrounding navigation.

### Step 5: Accumulate + Structure Content (incl. journey extraction — think → plan → many todos)

Parse each in-scope artifact into stakeholder-oriented slide sections (see Slide Taxonomy). See `references/artifact-accumulation.md` → "Per-Artifact-Type Parse Map" for which artifact maps to which section.

- Use REAL domain entity field names + realistic sample data from `docs/project-reference/domain-entities-reference.md` — never Lorem ipsum or "Item 1, Item 2".
- Keep accompanying prose/captions tech-agnostic (business/observable terms, not framework/CSS class names).
- **Extract each PBI's priority/rank** — read the `priority` label + numeric `rank` from each PBI's frontmatter (and the ranked-order backlog artifact `team-artifacts/backlog/*-backlog.md` when present). The Scope & backlog slide MUST display PBIs in ranked order with a priority label per PBI card — the deck carries the same priority info the backlog and mockups do. If PBIs lack priority, note it explicitly rather than dropping the field.
- **Extract the main-story / MVP flows into an ordered journey list** — from PBI `## Acceptance Criteria` GIVEN/WHEN/THEN + story "As a / I want / So that" + each mock-up's flow-specs (`references/artifact-accumulation.md` §6 Journey-Extraction Map). One journey per main user story (MVP happy path), each an ordered sequence: entry → click steps ("click X → see Y → move to Z") → end state + one plain-language explanation per step. When a `-mockup.html` exists, reuse its flow-specs verbatim so the deck demo == the per-PBI prototype.
- **`TaskCreate` one todo per journey slide** — so each journey is assembled (Step 6) and later verified (Step 8 demo integrity / final demo-quality review) individually. (The "think → plan → many todos before do".)

### Step 6: Assemble ONE Standalone HTML Deck

Build the single self-contained HTML file from the scaffold in `references/deck-template.md`:

- Inline `<style>` — design tokens as CSS variables, BEM class names, light/dark themes.
- Vanilla-JS slide engine — keyboard `←/→`/`Home`/`End`, nav dots, slide counter, theme toggle (no CDN reveal.js). Don't hijack arrow keys while a demo iframe is focused; OPTIONAL `postMessage('play')` to auto-start a journey degrades gracefully (`references/deck-template.md` §3b engine-coexistence note).
- **"How to drive this demo" guide slide** near the top — teach the viewer how to click hotspots and use each demo's own ▶ Play / ⏮ ⏭ / ↺ Reset controls (inside the mock-up) to walk a journey, and ←/→ to change slides, so a non-technical stakeholder is never lost (`references/deck-template.md` §3b).
- **Demo-flow slides (one per journey from Step 5):** each embeds the **interactive** `pbi-mockup` HTML scoped to that flow via `<iframe srcdoc="…escaped…">` and overlays a deck-level narration/explanation strip (current step + plain-language explanation, text only + "⚠ Simulated" note). The journey's ▶/⏮/⏭/↺ controls live INSIDE the embedded mock-up — it is self-driving; the deck adds only narration and does NOT re-implement or duplicate those controls (`references/deck-template.md` §3b).
- **Mockup-bearing path (`idea-to-pbi`):** embed each existing `-mockup.html` via `<iframe srcdoc="…escaped…">` — the entity-escaping rule (`&`-first, escape-once-unconditionally) is in `references/deck-template.md`. Never regenerate a mockup that already exists.
- **Spec-only path (`idea-to-spec`):** render the design-spec ASCII wireframes + Component Inventory / States / Design-Tokens tables instead of HTML mockups; the journey demo is a **narrated step-through of design-spec ASCII frames** advanced by Next, each with its step explanation. NO `<iframe srcdoc>` mockup embed, NEVER invoke `pbi-mockup`.
- **Empty-state (F3):** when an in-scope feature has NO `-mockup.html` AND NO design-spec, render an explicit empty-state slide ("No mockup/design-spec available for {feature}") — never a broken/blank iframe.

### Step 7: Save

- **Path:** `team-artifacts/presentations/{YYMMDD}-presentation-{slug}.html` (create the `presentations/` dir if absent).
- `{slug}` = the presented feature(s) or plan slug.

### Step 8: [BLOCKING] Fidelity Validation — Deck Matches Existing UI

> **[BLOCKING] After the deck is assembled, validate its visuals faithfully match the existing UI inventoried in Step 4 before handoff.** Do NOT report the deck as done until this validation records a result. Full procedure: `references/deck-template.md` → "[BLOCKING] Fidelity Gate".

The fidelity gate also covers **demo integrity** — every journey/demo slide clicks through end-to-end inside its iframe (each step reaches its end state via real hotspots); no dead controls; the narration strip names the current step + explanation and stays tech-agnostic (M1/M2); the "⚠ Simulated" note is visible; spec-only journeys advance their narrated ASCII frames.

Record the outcome in the Step 9 report:

```
Fidelity vs existing UI: PASS | FAIL — tokens / components / layout / flows / embeds / demos matched? If FAIL: what diverged + the fix.
```

If **FAIL**, revise the deck to match the existing UI and re-validate before handoff.

### Step 8b: [BLOCKING] Demo-Quality Review (final review todo)

> **[BLOCKING] Final review before the report (the per-journey todos and this gate were created in Step 5).** First confirm the deck **SATISFIES the intent**: every in-scope main user story is presented as a journey (coverage — no main story missing) AND each journey faithfully conveys that story's intended behavior, not merely that slides render. Then run a stakeholder-comprehension pass: *could a PO with no prior context follow each journey end-to-end?* Confirm every demo-flow slide clicks through, narration explains each step in plain language, the "⚠ Simulated" note is present, and the spec-only path degrades to narrated ASCII frames (never an HTML mockup). Record `Demo quality: PASS | FAIL` — FAIL if any main story is unrepresented or misrepresented, regardless of polish.

If **FAIL**, fix the journey slides (re-extract from the §6 journey map / re-embed the flow-scoped mockup) and re-review before handoff.

### Step 9: Report to User

After assembly, output:

```
Deck generated: team-artifacts/presentations/{YYMMDD}-presentation-{slug}.html
- Artifacts synthesized: {count} ({ideas}/{specs}/{pbis}/{stories}/{mockups}/{design-specs})
- Backlog priority: {ranked | not prioritized} — Scope & backlog slide shows {N} PBIs in ranked order with priority labels
- Demo journeys: {count} ({journey titles})
- Stakeholder sections: {title, how-to-demo, business-context, scope-backlog, behavior-rules, demo-flows, ui-mockups, qc-view, summary}
- Fidelity vs existing UI: PASS | FAIL
- Demo quality: PASS | FAIL

Open in browser to preview. Click highlighted hotspots or press ▶ Play to walk a journey; use ←/→ or nav dots to move between slides; theme toggle for light/dark.
```

## Slide Taxonomy (stakeholder-oriented)

Every slide section must serve the four stakeholder audiences (PO/BA/Dev/QC):

| Section                | Audience  | Content                                                                                  |
| ---------------------- | --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Title / agenda**     | all       | Feature(s) presented, run date, scope                                                    |
| **How to drive this demo** | all   | Early guide slide: click hotspots + each demo's own ▶ Play / ⏮ ⏭ / ↺ Reset controls (inside the mock-up); ←/→ change slides (`references/deck-template.md` §3b) |
| **Business context**   | PO/BA     | Problem, value, idea→spec narrative, epics/features                                       |
| **Scope & backlog**    | PO/BA/Dev | PBIs (in ranked order, each card showing its priority label + numeric rank from PBI frontmatter / backlog), user stories, acceptance criteria — priority is MANDATORY when PBIs are prioritized |
| **Behavior & rules**   | Dev/QC    | Feature Spec §4 business rules / §5 invariants, §8 test cases                             |
| **Demo flows / user journeys** | all | One interactive MVP demo slide per main user story: embedded interactive mockup scoped to the flow + a narration strip explaining each step ("click X → see Y → move to Z"); spec-only → narrated ASCII frames (`references/deck-template.md` §3b) |
| **UI / mockups**       | all       | Embedded `pbi-mockup` HTML (idea-to-pbi) OR design-spec ASCII + tables (idea-to-spec) OR empty-state |
| **QC view**            | QC/QA     | Test specifications, states matrix, edge cases                                           |
| **Summary / next steps** | all     | Recap, decisions needed, next workflow steps                                             |

## UI Layout

The deck is itself a UI artifact. ASCII of a slide frame:

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ◀  Feature Presentation — {Feature}     3 / 12  │  ← top bar: title + counter
├────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  ## Business Context                            │
│  • Problem  • Value  • Epics                     │  ← slide body (design-system tokens)
│  ┌──────────────────────────────────────────┐   │
│  │  <iframe srcdoc> embedded mockup / wire   │   │  ← embedded visual (or empty-state)
│  └──────────────────────────────────────────┘   │
├────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  ● ● ● ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○        ◀ Prev  Next ▶  │  ← nav dots + buttons (vanilla JS)
└────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Component tiers: common (slide shell, nav) — domain-shared (mockup/wireframe embed block) — page-app (per-artifact content slides). Keyboard `←/→`, `Home/End`; theme toggle (light/dark) reusing design-system tokens.

| Feature with no mockup AND no design-spec      | Empty-state slide ("No mockup/design-spec available") — never blank iframe |
| Demo iframe focused while navigating slides    | Don't hijack arrow keys while a demo iframe is focused (Step 6 / `deck-template.md` §3b) |

---

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Extend `pbi-mockup` with a `--deck` mode** (rejected) — `pbi-mockup` is per-PBI and mockup-scoped; a multi-artifact synthesis deck has a different input set and audience. Overloading one skill raises change cost and blurs the spec-only contract. Separate skill keeps each single-responsibility.
2. **CDN reveal.js / impress.js slide framework** (rejected) — violates the self-contained/no-external-deps contract (offline-break, supply-chain surface, new dependency). Vanilla-JS engine is ~60 lines, matches `pbi-mockup`'s zero-dep posture.
3. **Link to mockup files instead of inlining** (rejected) — breaks the "ONE standalone html file" mandate; a moved/un-co-located deck renders broken. `<iframe srcdoc>` keeps everything in one file.
4. **Chosen: standalone skill + inline single-file deck + iframe-srcdoc mockup embed.** Con: deck file size grows with embedded mockups — acceptable (HTML is text, gzips well; offline portability outweighs size).

## Design Rationale

A synthesis deck is a *different artifact at a different altitude* than a per-PBI mockup, so it earns its own skill — but it must NOT duplicate the mockup engine (reuse/embed). `<iframe srcdoc>` is the one mechanism satisfying BOTH "single standalone file" AND "reuse existing mockups" without re-rendering. Carrying `SYNC:existing-ui-research` + the fidelity gate is what makes the deck *project-faithful* rather than generic. The spec-only branch + empty-state slide preserve the `idea-to-spec` no-mockup contract while still giving stakeholders a visual. Running gap-fill sub-workflows as sub-agents keeps the deck-build context bounded — the deck skill consumes a summary, not the full workflow transcript.

---

## Security Considerations

`<iframe srcdoc>` embeds first-party generated mockup HTML only — no remote content, no user-supplied script. Entity-escaping the embedded mockup into `srcdoc` is also a safety boundary: it prevents an unescaped `</iframe>`/`<script>` in a mockup from breaking out of the embed. The deck opens offline (no network except the Google Fonts CSS). No secrets in artifacts.

---

## Workflow Recommendation

> **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION — NO EXCEPTIONS:** If you are NOT already in a workflow, you MUST ATTENTION use `AskUserQuestion` to ask the user. Do NOT judge task complexity or decide this is "simple enough to skip" — the user decides whether to use a workflow, not you:
>
> 1. **Activate `workflow-idea-to-pbi` workflow** (Recommended) — includes the presentation deck as a late step.
> 2. **Activate `workflow-idea-to-spec` workflow** — spec-only path; deck degrades to design-spec visuals.
> 3. **Execute `/feature-presentation` directly** — run this skill standalone on existing artifacts.

---

## Next Steps

**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION — NO EXCEPTIONS** after completing this skill, you MUST ATTENTION use `AskUserQuestion` to present these options. Do NOT skip because the task seems "simple" or "obvious" — the user decides:

- **"Open the deck"** — open the standalone HTML in a browser to review with stakeholders
- **"/prioritize"** — prioritize the synthesized PBIs in the backlog
- **"/plan"** — start implementation planning
- **"Skip, continue manually"** — user decides

> **[IMPORTANT]** Use `TaskCreate` to break ALL work into small tasks BEFORE starting.

> **Evidence Gate:** MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION — every claim, finding, and recommendation requires `file:line` proof or traced evidence with confidence percentage (>80% to act, <80% must verify first).

<!-- SYNC:existing-ui-research -->

> **[BLOCKING] Understand the existing UI before you design or spec a new/updated screen.** Before producing any wireframe, mockup, screen design, or UI spec:

> 1. **Inventory existing related UI** — search the project for screens, pages, and components already serving this feature or its domain (consult design-system docs + the real component inventory).
> 2. **Map connected flows** — identify every feature that links to, embeds, includes, or navigates to/from the new screen; trace its entry and exit flows so the new screen fits them.
> 3. **Reuse before invent** — prefer existing components, patterns, and layout conventions; justify any new component against what already exists.
> 4. **Record findings** — note the matched existing screens/components + connected flows in the artifact so downstream design faithfully matches the current UI system.
>
> **Skip ONLY** when the feature is backend-only (no UI) — state that explicitly.

> **AI Mistake Prevention** — Failure modes to avoid on every task:
>
> **Re-read files after context changes.** Context compaction, resume, or long-running work can make memory stale; verify current files before acting.
> **Verify generated content against source evidence.** AI hallucinates APIs, names, claims, and document facts. Check the relevant source before documenting or referencing.
> **Check downstream references before deleting or renaming.** Removing an artifact can stale docs, generated mirrors, configs, and callers; map references first.
> **Trace the full impact chain after edits.** Changing a definition can miss derived outputs and consumers. Follow the affected chain before declaring done.
> **Verify ALL affected outputs, not just the first.** One green check is not all green checks; validate every output surface the change can affect.
> **Assume existing values are intentional — ask WHY before changing.** Before changing a constant, limit, flag, wording, or pattern, read nearby context and history.
> **Surface ambiguity before acting — don't pick silently.** Multiple valid interpretations require an explicit question or stated assumption with risk.
> **Keep shared guidance role-relevant.** Universal guidance must help every receiving skill or agent; code-specific obligations belong only in code-specific protocols.

## Prompt-Enhance Closing Anchors

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** follow declared step order for this skill; NEVER skip, reorder, or merge steps without explicit user approval
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** for every step/sub-skill call: set `in_progress` before execution, set `completed` after execution
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** every skipped step MUST include explicit reason; every completed step MUST include concise evidence
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** if Task tools unavailable, maintain an equivalent step-by-step plan tracker with synchronized statuses

## Closing Reminders

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION Goal:** synthesize every session idea/spec/PBI/story/design-spec/mockup into ONE standalone HTML slide deck for PO/BA/Dev/QC — project-faithful, an interactive MVP demo of every main user journey, vanilla-JS engine — so the whole team reviews from a single offline file before build.

**Protocols in force (concise digest of the SYNC/shared blocks this skill carries):**

- **Existing-UI Research:** [BLOCKING] inventory existing UI + map connected flows before any visual.
- **AI Mistake Prevention:** verify generated content against evidence, trace downstream references, verify all affected outputs, re-read after context loss, surface ambiguity.
- **Critical Thinking:** MUST ATTENTION traced proof per claim, confidence >80% to act, NEVER guess.

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** emit exactly ONE self-contained HTML deck at `team-artifacts/presentations/{YYMMDD}-presentation-{slug}.html` — inline CSS/JS, Google Fonts only, NO CDN reveal.js, vanilla-JS slide engine — why: stakeholders open one offline file with no server, no build step.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** present every in-scope main user story as an interactive MVP demo slide ("click X → see Y → move to Z") — extract the journeys first (Step 5, one todo per journey), embed the self-driving interactive mockup + a deck narration strip + "⚠ Simulated" note, add a "How to drive this demo" guide slide, and sign off with the final Demo-Quality review (Step 8b) — why: a narrated journey answers "how does it work", which is what the user asked for; the deck adds only narration, never a second interactivity engine.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** REUSE existing `-mockup.html` via `<iframe srcdoc="…escaped…">` — never regenerate a mockup that already exists; escaping rule (`&`-first, escape-once-unconditionally) lives in `references/deck-template.md` — why: re-rendering duplicates the mockup engine and risks divergence.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** spec-only `idea-to-spec` → design-spec ASCII wireframes + inventory/states/tokens tables + a narrated step-through of ASCII frames ONLY; NEVER generate HTML mockups, NEVER invoke `pbi-mockup` — why: full mockups break the spec-only no-code contract.

**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** break work into small todo tasks using `TaskCreate` BEFORE starting; add a final review todo to verify quality.
**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** validate route/next-step decisions with the user via `AskUserQuestion` — standalone + no prompt → ask which specs/ideas to present, never silently guess scope.

**Domain rules this skill must not skip:**

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** default scope anchors on `activePlan` and accumulates its FULL artifact set across the plan's created→now date range — NEVER just today's `{YYMMDD}` — why: a multi-day workflow authors specs on day 1 and PBIs on day 2; a single-day glob silently drops day-1 artifacts.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** run multi-step gap-fill workflows (`workflow-spec-to-pbi`) as SUB-AGENTS — summary returned, full findings written to `plans/reports/` per CLAUDE.md "Workflow Step Advancement §3" — why: inline activation pollutes the deck-build context with the full workflow transcript.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** render an explicit empty-state slide when scope resolves to zero artifacts OR a feature has no mockup AND no design-spec — never fail, never a broken/blank iframe — why: stakeholders must always get a coherent deck.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** [BLOCKING] inventory existing UI (Step 4) BEFORE assembling, then run the [BLOCKING] fidelity gate (Step 8, incl. demo integrity — every journey clicks through, no dead controls, narration tech-agnostic) AFTER — record `Fidelity vs existing UI: PASS|FAIL` (tokens / components / layout / flows / embeds / demos) and the final `Demo quality: PASS|FAIL` (Step 8b) — why: a generic-HTML or click-broken deck previews a system that does not exist.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** use REAL domain entity field names + realistic sample data — NEVER Lorem ipsum or "Item 1, Item 2"; keep prose tech-agnostic (business terms, not framework/CSS class names) — why: fake data and tech-coupled prose mislead stakeholders.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** the Scope & backlog slide MUST show PBIs in ranked order with each card's priority label + numeric rank (read from PBI frontmatter / the ranked backlog artifact) whenever the PBIs are prioritized — why: priority is a primary PO/BA decision input; a deck that hides it forces stakeholders back to the raw backlog. Note explicitly if PBIs are not yet prioritized rather than dropping the field.

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** cite `file:line` evidence for every claim/finding (confidence >80% to act, <80% verify first) — NEVER speculate about artifacts, design tokens, or component patterns without reading the source.

**Anti-Rationalization:**

| Evasion                                          | Rebuttal                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "reveal.js is easier than a vanilla engine"      | CDN violates the self-contained contract. Vanilla-JS engine (~60 lines), Google Fonts only.   |
| "Regenerate the mockup, it's cleaner"            | Embed the existing `-mockup.html` via `<iframe srcdoc>`. Never duplicate the mockup engine.    |
| "Add a quick HTML mockup to the idea-to-spec deck"| Spec-only contract — design-spec ASCII + tables + narrated ASCII frames ONLY. No mockups, no `pbi-mockup`. |
| "A still screenshot of the mockup is enough"     | The user asked for an interactive MVP demo of each main journey — embed the self-driving mockup + a narration strip, don't flatten it to a still. |
| "Re-implement the click-through in the deck"     | The deck adds only narration; the mockup is self-driving (one engine). Embed it, don't duplicate its interactivity. |
| "Glob today's date, it's the same session"       | Multi-day workflows span midnight. Glob the plan's created→now range or day-1 artifacts vanish. |
| "Run the gap-fill workflow inline, it's faster"  | Multi-step workflows run as SUB-AGENTS — summary + `plans/reports/`. Keeps context bounded.    |
| "No mockup? leave the slide blank"               | Render an explicit empty-state slide. Never a broken/blank iframe.                             |
| "PBI titles are enough on the backlog slide"     | Show each PBI in ranked order with its priority label + rank — priority is a primary PO/BA input; read it from PBI frontmatter / the backlog artifact. |

**[TASK-PLANNING]** Before acting, analyze task scope and systematically break it into small todo tasks and sub-tasks using TaskCreate.

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION Goal:** ONE standalone HTML deck synthesizing every session artifact for PO/BA/Dev/QC — project-faithful, offline, an interactive MVP demo of every main user journey.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** ONE self-contained HTML (Google Fonts only, vanilla-JS engine), one interactive demo-flow slide per main journey (embedded self-driving mockup + narration strip + "⚠ Simulated" note) + a "How to drive this demo" guide slide; spec-only → design-spec visuals + narrated ASCII frames (never invoke `pbi-mockup`), empty-state slide never blank iframe.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** plan journeys first (Step 5, one todo each), default scope = active-plan created→now range (not just today), gap-fill via SUB-AGENT, [BLOCKING] existing-UI inventory + fidelity gate (incl. demo integrity) + final Demo-Quality review (Step 8b), real domain data, cite `file:line` (>80% confidence) — NEVER guess.
