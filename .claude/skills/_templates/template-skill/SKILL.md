> **[IMPORTANT]** Use `TaskCreate` to break ALL work into small tasks BEFORE starting — including tasks for each file read. This prevents context loss from long files. For simple tasks, AI MUST ATTENTION ask user whether to skip.

**Be skeptical. Apply critical thinking, sequential thinking. Every claim needs traced proof, confidence percentages (Idea should be more than 80%).**

**Prerequisites:**

<!-- PROTOCOL-GUIDES:START -->

> **Protocol guides** — A hook delivers each protocol's full text when this skill loads. If a protocol's text is not in your context, read its file below before you act on it.

- `evidence-based-reasoning` — Ground every material claim in file:line, config or source evidence, with stated confidence; making any claim, finding or recommendation → .claude/skills/shared/protocols/evidence-based-reasoning.md
- `understand-code-first` — Read and trace the target and existing patterns before changing code; planning or editing code → .claude/skills/shared/protocols/understand-code-first.md

<!-- PROTOCOL-GUIDES:END -->

<!-- SYNC:understand-code-first:reminder -->

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** search 3+ existing patterns and read code/conventions BEFORE any modification or explanation. Run graph trace when graph.db exists.

<!-- /SYNC:understand-code-first:reminder -->

<!-- SYNC:evidence-based-reasoning:reminder -->

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** cite `file:line` evidence for every claim; never speculate. Confidence >80% to act, <60% = do NOT recommend; "not enough evidence" is valid output.

<!-- /SYNC:evidence-based-reasoning:reminder -->

## Closing Reminders

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** break work into small todo tasks using `TaskCreate` BEFORE starting
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** cite `file:line` evidence for every claim (confidence >80% to act)
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** add a final review todo task to verify work quality

**[TASK-PLANNING]** Before acting, analyze task scope and systematically break it into small todo tasks and sub-tasks using TaskCreate.
