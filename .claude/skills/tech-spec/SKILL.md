## Quick Summary

> **Portability:** the technical root is read from `docs/project-config.json` → `specRoots.technical.path` (declared `authorship: "derived"`, `m1Policy: "exempt"`). NEVER hardcode a root. `{TechRoot}/{Service}/{Component}.md` is a **pattern** — `{Service}` and `{Component}` are placeholders resolved from the repo, never literal names.

**[IMPORTANT] TaskCreate** — Break ALL work into small tasks BEFORE starting (one task per emitted artifact).

**Goal:** Project code and test annotations into a regenerable, single-writer technical view (per-component use-case inventory, TC↔test map, and cross-service topology) without creating a second source of truth; code and tests remain canonical.

**Summary:**

- **Purpose:** a DERIVED-view **generator** ONLY — greps handlers/consumers/jobs/producers and test annotations to emit `{TechRoot}/{Service}/{Component}.md`; it **NEVER authors business content**. Code + tests stay the source of truth.
- **Main steps (run in order):** **Step 0** Scope Gate — `AskUserQuestion` (service/component + mode), BLOCKING before any read; no source to derive from → STOP. **Step 1** Derive facts — grep the use-case inventory, the `TestSpec`/`TechnicalSpec` joins, the topology. **Step 2** Instantiate templates — `references/author.md`'s fixed sections in pinned order. **Step 3** Stamp & Write — DERIVED banner + regenerate date, write each artifact immediately (never accumulate in context). **Step 4** Verify — no retired artifacts, banner present, no business artifact types, no canonical claims, no secrets.
- **Modes:** `generate` (default — regenerate the derived view) · `audit` (report which views are stale vs code/tests) · `sync` (report canonical §8 TC ↔ executing test-code drift — `references/sync.md`).
- Hard prohibition is the load-bearing rule: never emit the retired A-E engineering tree, `M##` dirs, `00-module-registry.md`, `01-domain-erd.md`, or `06-reimplementation-guide.md` under the technical root — why: an A-E bundle becomes a second source of truth competing with the Feature Spec, and a generator able to recreate it resurrects the retired tree on its next run (this has occurred once already, via rebase).
- Every generated file carries the `> DERIVED — regenerate with the tech-spec skill; do NOT hand-edit` banner + a regenerate date, anchors each fact back to its source, and makes **no canonical claim**.
- **This skill is M1-EXEMPT** (`specRoots.technical.m1Policy: "exempt"`) — its prose MAY name technology. That exemption is the whole reason this tree exists; it is NOT a licence to carry business content (see **Hard Prohibitions**).

> **[SCOPE]** This skill generates a **DERIVED** technical view over code + tests under `specRoots.technical.path`. It MUST NOT emit a per-module A-E engineering bundle (`A-domain-model`, `B-business-rules`, `C-api-contracts`, `D-events`, `E-user-journeys`), `M##` directories, `00-module-registry.md`, `01-domain-erd.md`, or `06-reimplementation-guide.md` — those are not part of the spec model. It MUST NOT author business content: the Feature Spec under `specRoots.business.path` owns §1–§8, and this skill neither writes nor amends it. Authority: [`docs/project-reference/spec-system-reference.md`](../../../docs/project-reference/spec-system-reference.md), [`.claude/skills/shared/sdd-artifact-contract.md`](../shared/sdd-artifact-contract.md).

**Inputs:** the code tree (command/query handlers, event consumers, background jobs, producers, sagas, outbox) and the test tree (`TestSpec` and `TechnicalSpec` annotations when present). **Code is the technical source of truth** — this skill reads it to **project** a view, never to populate a parallel *canonical* layer.

**Modes:**

| Mode       | Trigger                                    | Input                                          | Output                                                                       |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `generate` | default — refresh the derived view          | code + test annotations                         | `{TechRoot}/{Service}/{Component}.md`, all DERIVED (`references/author.md`)   |
| `audit`    | explicit request — staleness check          | code/test mtimes or git vs derived-view age     | Stale-list report (which views lag their source). Never mutates             |
| `sync`     | "sync tests" / "reconcile tests" / harvest  | canonical §8 TCs + test code                    | §8/test drift report + route-only `CoveredBy:`/orphan reconciliation (`references/sync.md`) |

**Tooling:**

- `npm run tech-spec:generate` — regenerate the derived technical views from code/test annotations.
  Equivalent direct invocation, for projects that copy `.claude/` without a `package.json`:
  `node .claude/skills/tech-spec/scripts/generate-tech-specs.mjs`
- `npm run tech-spec:check` — read-only freshness and annotation-occurrence completeness gate; it
  explicitly skips when this project has no `techSpecScan` contract.
  Equivalent direct invocation:
  `node .claude/skills/tech-spec/scripts/generate-tech-specs.mjs --check`
  The direct command remains fail-closed when a project contract is absent or malformed; use
  `--optional` only for an orchestration/package entry point that should record an absent contract as
  a skip.

**Mode resolution (do this before any work):**

1. Parse the mode from the invocation: explicit `[mode=<x>]` arg wins; else infer ("regenerate tech specs", "technical spec for {Component}" → `generate`; "stale", "audit" → `audit`; "sync tests", "reconcile tests", "reverse sync", "harvest" → `sync`).
2. If ambiguous, present the detected mode via `AskUserQuestion` before proceeding — NEVER auto-start a mutating mode.
3. **Read the matching `references/` body** — it is the single source of truth for that mode's procedure, gates, and output contract. Do not run a mode from memory.

**Workflow:** `/investigate` (locate the component) → `/tech-spec` (project the view) → `/changes-review` → `/watzup`

**Key Rules:**

- **MUST ATTENTION** resolve `specRoots.technical.path` and the mode before reading; never hardcode project roots or component names.
- **NEVER** author business content or emit retired A-E artifacts; code/tests remain the source of truth.
- **MUST ATTENTION** derive facts mechanically, anchor them to sources, write each artifact immediately, and verify regeneration is idempotent.
- **NEVER** let the harvest detector gate generation; it reports candidates while C1/C2/C6/C7 remain hard errors.

## The Generator Contract (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

This skill is a **generator**, not an author. Every clause below is structural — none is a preference a future maintainer may relax for convenience.

| # | Clause | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **C1** | **[BLOCKING]** Output is **DERIVED and regenerable** — every generated file carries a `> DERIVED — regenerate with the tech-spec skill; do NOT hand-edit` banner + a regenerate date. It is **NEVER a second source of truth**. | A derived view makes no truth claim, so it cannot compete for canonical status. A hand-editable tree makes one — and then "which is right, the doc or the code?" becomes askable. |
| **C2** | **[BLOCKING]** **Never authors business content.** No user story, no acceptance criterion, no business rule, no §1–§7 prose, no §8 TC is written by this skill — in any mode. The Feature Spec stays the source of truth for all of it. | Carrying the Feature Spec's own artifact types is exactly how a rival tree competes on the Feature Spec's turf. |
| **C3** | **[BLOCKING]** **Never claims to be a source of truth.** The generated files never assert canonical authority. When the view disagrees with code, **code is right by construction and the view is stale — regenerate it.** | A derived aid that asserts canonical authority corrupts the single-writer contract. |
| **C4** | **[BLOCKING]** **Write each artifact immediately** after instantiating it; do NOT accumulate large outputs in context. | A `{Service}/{Component}` fan-out is exactly the case that exhausts context mid-run and loses every unwritten artifact. |
| **C5** | **[BLOCKING]** **Single writer.** This skill is the **sole writer** under `specRoots.technical.path`. Nothing else writes there; it writes nowhere else. | Two writers is how a view becomes a sibling. |
| **C6** | **[BLOCKING]** **Regeneration is idempotent** — regenerating over unchanged source produces an **empty diff**. | This is the tree's flagship oracle: it proves the artifact can be thrown away and rebuilt from its source. If it cannot, the tree holds content of its own — it claims truth, and it is a rival. |
| **C7** | **[BLOCKING]** **A-E filenames are never emitted.** See **Hard Prohibitions**. | An A-E bundle becomes a second source of truth competing with the Feature Spec. |

### C8 — Mechanical detect + route · never judge · never write business content

> **A generator MUST NEVER apply RIT — or any judgment test — at generation time.** Judgment produces data; generators consume data.
> Canonical formulation: [`.claude/skills/shared/sdd-artifact-contract.md`](../shared/sdd-artifact-contract.md) (beside RIT). **Cited, not restated.**

| | Who | When | Output |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Judgment** (RIT, business-invariant verdicts, visibility classification) | a human, or an AI **outside** this generator | **once**, at authoring/classification time | a **persisted verdict — data** |
| **Generation** | `/tech-spec` | every run | output **mechanically re-derived** from that data |

**Idempotency holds because nothing is re-judged.** The generator reads a verdict it did not make and cannot revise. Same source + same verdicts ⇒ same output, every run. **A generator that judges is not idempotent — it fails C6 against its own tree, permanently, and the failure reports as `hand-edited`, which is the wrong cause and undiagnosable.**

**Two resolutions that are FORBIDDEN, because both look like fixes:**

| Rejected | Why it fails |
| --- | --- |
| **Scope idempotency to only the mechanical sections** | Reintroduces a **per-section carve-out** — an exemption at a new address. A carve-out is this framework's characteristic failure; do not re-mint one inside the oracle. |
| **Cache judgments inside the generator** | The generator then owns a **staleness problem**: a cached verdict that outlives the code it judged, invisible to review and to `git`. **Persisted verdicts belong in the artifact, not in generator state.** |

### C9 — The harvest detector REPORTS; it never gates

> **A structural proxy for a semantic property REPORTS; it never blocks.**
> Canonical formulation: [`.claude/skills/shared/sdd-artifact-contract.md`](../shared/sdd-artifact-contract.md) (beside RIT). **Cited, not restated.**

Harvest **detection** is a structural signal — *an invariant enforced at ≥2 points with no business rule citing it* (the countable property `references/sync.md` step 2 already asks for). It is **mechanical**, so this skill may perform it. Its output is a **candidate list** for human or `/spec [mode=update]` adjudication.

- **NEVER an `error`. NEVER a build gate. NEVER a precondition on regeneration. NEVER a fixture that fails CI.**
- The detector is a **structural proxy**: it infers a semantic property from a correlate, and the rule-citation link it reads is **prose, not a key**. It has false positives (a covered invariant can present as uncovered) **and** false negatives (an invariant enforced at one chokepoint is invisible to a ≥2-point counter).
- **Why it may not gate:** a false positive that blocks a build gets suppressed — **and a suppressed detector is a dead detector.** A `report` cannot be suppressed, because it never blocked anything worth suppressing it for.
- **A detection changes the report, never the tree** — so it cannot break C6.

**The boundary — C9 does NOT license softening anything else:**

| Rule | Operationally defined? | Severity | Why |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **C1** — DERIVED banner | **Yes** — a literal string test | **`error`** | The banner check **is** the rule |
| **C6** — regeneration-idempotency | **Yes** — regenerate, diff empty | **`error`** | **An ORACLE, not a proxy — it re-runs the transform and compares. It does not infer.** |
| **C7** — no A-E resurrection | **Yes** — a **closed** filename set | **`error`** | The filename list **is** the rule |
| **C2** — no `US-`/`AC-`/`BR-` in the technical tree | **Yes** — a static prefix denylist | **`error`** | The prefix list **is** the rule |
| **M1 / tech-token bans on the business tree** | **Yes** — a token denylist | **`error`** | Operationally defined; the spine stands |
| **Harvest detector** | **No** — measures a correlate and **infers** | **REPORT — never gates** | The proxy rule |

> **Do not misread C6 as a proxy.** C6's rule is *"regeneration over unchanged source produces an empty diff"* — **and the empty diff IS the rule.** It executes the property rather than reasoning toward it. Demoting C6 would destroy the only real oracle here. **C6 gates at `error`, and nothing stands behind it to be a proxy for.**

---

## Step 0 — Scope Gate (MANDATORY FIRST)

Before reading anything, use `AskUserQuestion`. Confirm:

| Dimension       | Question                                                                                          | Auto-Default          |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| **Scope** ★     | Which `{Service}` / `{Component}` — one component, one service, or the whole technical root?      | — must confirm        |
| **Mode** ★      | `generate` (regenerate the view) OR `audit` (staleness report) OR `sync` (reconcile §8 ↔ tests)?  | `generate`            |
| **Sections**    | Full view, or a subset (use-case inventory / TC↔test map / topology)?                             | Full view             |

> **[BLOCKING]** Resolve `specRoots.technical.path` from `docs/project-config.json` FIRST. If it is absent, STOP — the technical root is not configured and this skill has no destination. NEVER hardcode a root.
> **[BLOCKING]** If the target `{Service}`/`{Component}` has **no** derivable source (no handlers, consumers, jobs, or annotated tests), STOP — there is nothing to derive from. **NEVER fabricate a component to document.**

---

## Step 1 — Derive the Facts (grep, never recall)

Read `references/author.md` and execute its derivation greps. Extract ONLY mechanically-derivable facts:

1. **Use Case Inventory** — write ops (N), read ops (M), event-driven (K), background jobs (J), and actor roles, per `references/author.md`.
2. **TC↔test map** — the join over existing test annotations (`TestSpec` for business TC coverage, `TechnicalSpec` for technical-only coverage when present), generated from the annotations that already exist in code. **NEVER hand-move this data.**
3. **Cross-service topology** — producers, consumers, sagas, shared contracts, data ownership (the `SYNC:cross-service-check` scan below is the procedure).
4. **Anchors** — every fact carries an abstract `[Source: {namespace}/{service}/{id}]` anchor.

> **Scale note:** for a service with many components, you MAY spawn parallel reader sub-agents (one per component) that each return the extracted fields above. This is an optimization, not a gate.
> **[BLOCKING]** Do NOT interpret, rank, assess business relevance, or judge any derived fact (**C8**). Count it, anchor it, emit it.

---

## Step 2 — Instantiate the Templates

Per `references/author.md`: fixed sections, **declared order**, **pinned table sort keys**, templated prose over grepped values.

> **[BLOCKING]** **A fact that cannot be templated is emitted in a table, never narrated.** Free composition is where non-determinism lives, and it breaks **C6**.

---

## Step 3 — Stamp & Write

- Every generated file opens with the `> DERIVED — regenerate with the tech-spec skill; do NOT hand-edit` banner + a regenerate date.
- Write each file immediately after instantiating it; do NOT accumulate large outputs in context (**C4**).

---

## Step 4 — Verify (self-check before completing)

- [ ] **No retired artifacts emitted** — grep your own output paths: zero `M[0-9]` dirs, zero `A-domain-model`/`B-business-rules`/`C-api-contracts`/`D-events`/`E-user-journeys`, zero `00-module-registry`/`01-domain-erd`/`06-reimplementation-guide`.
- [ ] **DERIVED banner + regenerate date present** on each generated file.
- [ ] **No business artifact types** — zero `US-`, `AC-`, `BR-` identifiers anywhere under the technical root (**C2**).
- [ ] **No canonical claims** — the derived files never assert they are the source of truth (**C3**).
- [ ] **Every anchor resolves** — grep the source path; mark `[UNVERIFIED]` rather than guessing.
- [ ] **No secrets** — zero connection strings, credentials, tokens, internal hostnames, or customer data encountered while reading config/seeders/fixtures.
- [ ] **Idempotency** — re-running over unchanged source produces an empty diff (**C6**).

---

## Hard Prohibitions (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

This skill produces only the DERIVED technical view. Emitting an A-E engineering tree would create a second source of truth competing with the Feature Spec — and a generator still able to recreate A-E would **resurrect the retired tree on its next run**, which is an active hazard rather than a theoretical one: the tree has come back once already through a rebase and had to be re-deleted. Therefore this skill MUST NEVER create:

| Forbidden output                                                                                          | Why                                                                |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `M##` directories (e.g., `M01/`, `M02/`)                                                                  | Retired per-module partition                                       |
| `A-domain-model.md` / `B-business-rules.md` / `C-api-contracts.md` / `D-events.md` / `E-user-journeys.md` | Retired A-E engineering bundle — content lives in the Feature Spec |
| `00-module-registry.md`                                                                                   | Retired registry                                                   |
| `01-domain-erd.md`                                                                                        | Retired per-system ERD name                                        |
| `06-reimplementation-guide.md`                                                                            | Retired per-system name                                            |
| Any `US-` / `AC-` / `BR-` identifier                                                                      | Business artifact types — the Feature Spec owns them (**C2**)      |
| Any file under `specRoots.business.path`                                                                  | This skill never writes the business tree (**C5**)                 |
| A hand-edit invitation, a "maintained by" line, or any canonical claim                                    | The view is regenerable output (**C1**, **C3**)                    |

**Scope:** this prohibition governs the **emit set** under `specRoots.technical.path` — the filenames this skill may create. It does not ban writing those names in prose elsewhere (an ADR recording the retirement must be able to name them as history).

If a user explicitly asks for an A-E bundle, explain it is retired and offer the derived view instead. If a user asks this skill to write a business rule or user story, **route to `/spec`** — this skill has no authoring path.

## What Is `/tech-spec`?

A **derived-view generator** over code + tests. The canonical technical knowledge is **the code itself**, and a technical-only behavior's guard is **its test**; this skill assembles a regenerable projection (use-case inventory, TC↔test map, topology) so a component's technical surface can be read without a second hand-maintained layer. It does **not** reverse-engineer code into a parallel *canonical* bundle — that role was retired with the A-E tree, and this skill exists precisely because a projection cannot rival its own source.

## Prompt-Enhance Closing Anchors

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** follow declared step order for this skill; NEVER skip, reorder, or merge steps without explicit user approval
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** for every step/sub-skill call: set `in_progress` before execution, set `completed` after execution
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** every skipped step MUST include explicit reason; every completed step MUST include concise evidence
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** if Task tools unavailable, maintain an equivalent step-by-step plan tracker with synchronized statuses

<!-- PROMPT-ENHANCE:STEP-TASK-CLOSING:END -->

<!-- SYNC:parallel-subagent-dispatch -->

> **Parallel Sub-Agent Dispatch** — Plan parallelism the moment a task breakdown exists, BEFORE executing it — running provably independent tasks sequentially wastes wall-clock. Applies to every multi-step job: workflow steps, planning, batch updates, investigation, research, scans, reviews, doc sync. **Plan execution is metadata-gated, NEVER default-parallel** — fan-out follows ONLY what the plan declares (`PAR`/`SEQ` tags + per-phase write set); an untagged plan runs sequentially — why: a derived write set cannot see cascade or generated writes.
>
> 1. **Tag every task `PAR` or `SEQ`.** `PAR` = inputs exclude every pending task's output AND write set disjoint from every other `PAR`. Else `SEQ` — MUST ATTENTION name the dependency forcing it.
> 2. **Group `PAR` into waves.** No edge between members. Two writers of one file NEVER share a wave. Read-only work (search, investigation, review, research) parallelizes freely.
> 3. **Declare before dispatch:** `Parallel plan: wave 1 = [...] · wave 2 = [...] · SEQ = [...] (reason)`.
> 4. **Spawn each wave in ONE message** — every `Agent` call in one response, NEVER dripped per turn. Route each task to its specialist (`.claude/skills/shared/sub-agent-selection-guide.md`); NEVER `code-reviewer` as catch-all.
> 5. **Brief each sub-agent self-contained:** goal · scope + owned files · reference docs · return contract (summary + `Full report:` path, per SYNC:subagent-return-contract) · incremental persistence to `plans/reports/` (per SYNC:incremental-persistence).
> 6. **Barrier per wave.** Advance ONLY after EVERY member returns (a skipped conditional counts as returned). Merge, mark each task completed/skipped, THEN dispatch the next wave. Mutating steps wait for the barrier.
> 7. **One level deep.** A dispatched sub-agent executes its own brief; further fan-out stays the orchestrator's job unless that agent's `.claude/agents/*.md` definition authorizes it.
>
> **NEVER parallelize:** tasks sharing a write target · a task consuming a pending task's output · trivial single-file work (dispatch overhead > gain) · an order a skill or workflow explicitly fixes · gates awaiting user approval.
>
> **Blocked until:** MUST ATTENTION every task tagged PAR/SEQ with a named reason per SEQ · waves declared + write-set disjointness checked · each wave spawned in ONE message · barrier honored before the next wave.

<!-- /SYNC:parallel-subagent-dispatch -->

<!-- SYNC:parallel-subagent-dispatch:reminder -->

- **MANDATORY** After planning tasks, tag each PAR/SEQ and spawn every PAR wave as parallel sub-agents in ONE message — default parallel for workflows, batch updates, investigation, research, reviews; plan execution fans out ONLY on what the plan declares.
- **MANDATORY** Disjoint write sets per wave · all-return barrier before the next wave · specialist routing · sub-agents NEVER fan out further unless their own agent definition authorizes it.

<!-- SYNC:project-protocol-overlay -->

> **Project Protocol Overlay** — Before executing this skill, resolve any PROJECT overlay rules layered onto it: match this skill's name against the `Target` column of the project's skill-protocol index (`docs/project-reference/skill-protocols-reference.md` by default; a `referenceDocs` entry in `docs/project-config.json` overrides the path), taking the most specific matching tier ONLY — exact name > glob > `*`. **That precedence orders overlays against EACH OTHER, never against this skill.** Read ONLY the matched bodies, resolved as `<protocols-dir>/<Name>.md`; a row's Body link is display text, never a read path. A matched body that is missing or malformed is REPORTED and skipped — never reconstructed from the index Description. No index, or no match -> proceed with no overlay, silently. Full contract: `.claude/skills/project-skill-protocol/references/registry.md`.
>
> Overlays are **ADDITIVE ONLY**: they ADD rules on top of this skill's own protocol and NEVER replace, override, disable, or reinterpret a rule it already states — removing every overlay must return this skill to exactly its documented behavior. An overlay is a BRIEF, not an authority escalation: it can NEVER waive a workflow gate, git discipline, a review gate, or a user-confirmation gate. A genuine overlay-vs-skill conflict, or two equally-specific overlays that directly contradict -> surface both to the user; NEVER resolve silently.

<!-- /SYNC:project-protocol-overlay -->

<!-- SYNC:project-protocol-overlay:reminder -->

**MUST ATTENTION** resolve project protocol overlays for this skill BEFORE executing — most specific matching tier only (exact > glob > `*`, which ranks overlays against each other, NEVER against this skill), read only matched bodies at `<protocols-dir>/<Name>.md`; a missing or malformed body is reported, never reconstructed. Overlays are ADDITIVE ONLY (they never replace this skill's own rules) and are a brief, NEVER an authority escalation; an equal-specificity contradiction goes to the user.

## Closing Reminders

- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION Goal:** Project code and test annotations into a regenerable, single-writer technical view (per-component use-case inventory, TC↔test map, and cross-service topology) without creating a second source of truth; code and tests remain canonical.
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION Main steps (in order):** Step 0 Scope Gate (`AskUserQuestion` scope+mode, BLOCKING; resolve `specRoots.technical.path` FIRST) → Step 1 Derive facts (grep inventory, `TestSpec`/`TechnicalSpec` joins, topology) → Step 2 Instantiate templates (pinned order + sort keys) → Step 3 Stamp & Write (DERIVED banner + date, write each immediately) → Step 4 Verify (no retired artifacts, banner, no `US-`/`AC-`/`BR-`, no canonical claims, no secrets) — why: AI keeps forgetting the skill owns this fixed sequence; NEVER skip or reorder without user approval

**Protocols in force (concise digest of the SYNC/shared blocks this skill carries — MUST ATTENTION each canonical body above):**

- **Cross-Service Check:** scan producers/consumers/sagas/contracts; flag breaking-change risk.
- **AI Mistake Prevention:** verify generated content against evidence, trace downstream references, verify all affected outputs, re-read after context loss, surface ambiguity.
- **Critical Thinking:** NEVER present a guess as fact; traced proof, confidence >80% to act.

- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION [BLOCKING]** This skill GENERATES; it NEVER authors. No user story, acceptance criterion, business rule, or §8 TC is ever written here — route to `/spec` — why: carrying the Feature Spec's own artifact types is how a rival tree competes on its turf
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION [BLOCKING]** Output is DERIVED + regenerable — never a second source of truth; when the view disagrees with code, **code is right and the view is stale — regenerate it**
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION [BLOCKING]** Never emit `M##`/A-E/`00-module-registry`/`01-domain-erd`/`06-reimplementation-guide` under the technical root — why: an A-E bundle becomes a second source of truth, and a generator able to recreate it resurrects the retired tree on its next run
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION [BLOCKING]** Stamp the DERIVED banner + regenerate date on every generated file; write after each artifact, never accumulate large outputs in context
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION [BLOCKING]** **Never judge at generation time** (**C8**) — mechanical detect + route only; judgment is not stable across runs, so a judging generator stops being idempotent and fails **C6** against its own tree while reporting the cause as `hand-edited`
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION [BLOCKING]** The harvest detector **REPORTS, never gates** (**C9**) — never `error`, never a build gate, never a precondition on regeneration — why: a false positive that blocks a build gets suppressed, and a suppressed detector is a dead detector. **This does NOT soften C1/C2/C6/C7 or M1 — all stay at `error`; C6 is an oracle, not a proxy**
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION [BLOCKING]** Confirm scope + mode via `AskUserQuestion` BEFORE any read; no derivable source → STOP, never fabricate a component to document
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION [REQUIRED]** Read the root from `specRoots.technical.path`; `{TechRoot}/{Service}/{Component}.md` is a PATTERN — never hardcode a root, a project, a service, or a TC ID
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION [REQUIRED]** Templated prose over grepped facts ONLY — a fact that cannot be templated goes in a table, never a sentence — why: free composition is where non-determinism lives, and it breaks the idempotency oracle **and** is how a secret gets incidentally pasted
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** Cite `[Source:]` anchor evidence for every derived fact (confidence >80% to act, <60% mark `[UNVERIFIED]`) — NEVER fabricate a handler, consumer, job, or TC ID; grep to confirm
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** Break task scope into small `TaskCreate` todos (one per emitted artifact) before acting; mark each `completed` immediately after its file is written; keep exactly one `in_progress`
- **Parallel Sub-Agent Dispatch:** Tag tasks PAR/SEQ, group PAR into disjoint-write-set waves, spawn each wave in ONE message, barrier before advancing.

| ------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "I found real insight the grep missed — I'll just add a note" | That is authoring. The view holds nothing of its own. Un-greppable nuance belongs in a code comment or an ADR next to the code. |
| "This component needs a business rule written down"           | Route to `/spec [mode=update]`. This skill detects and reports; it has no authoring path.                          |
| "The regenerate diff is noisy — I'll scope idempotency to the mechanical sections" | That is a per-section carve-out — the exemption disease at a new address. **Shrink the prose surface; NEVER relax the oracle.** |
| "The harvest detector found a real gap — make it fail the build" | NEVER. It is a proxy; a proxy that blocks gets suppressed, and a suppressed detector is dead. Report it.          |
| "The tech tree is M1-exempt, so business content is fine too" | Two orthogonal properties. `m1Policy` governs tech-agnostic strictness; it says nothing about business content. `US-`/`AC-`/`BR-` stay banned. |
| "Hand-editing this one file is faster than regenerating"      | A hand-edited derived file is a build failure. Fix the generator or the source, then regenerate.                   |
| "I'll cache the judgment so the next run is consistent"       | Generator-owned state is a staleness problem invisible to review and to `git`. Verdicts live in the artifact.      |
| "A-E would express this better for engineers"                 | A-E is retired and has resurrected once already. Emit the derived view.                                            |

**[TASK-PLANNING]** MUST ATTENTION analyze task scope and break into small todo tasks/sub-tasks via TaskCreate before acting.

> **[IMPORTANT]** Break into many small todo tasks systematically before starting — this is critical.

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** GENERATE, never author — output is DERIVED + regenerable; code + tests are the source of truth.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** Never judge at generation time; the harvest detector reports and never gates — but C1/C2/C6/C7 stay at `error`.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** Root from `specRoots.technical.path`; never emit A-E/`M##`/retired filenames; never write `US-`/`AC-`/`BR-`.
