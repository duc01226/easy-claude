## Quick Summary

> **Review modes:** For review/audit work, standalone defaults to `--review-only` (`--report-only` alias); `--fix-loop` enables review → validate → authorized fix → fresh re-review, default cap 3. `--fix-loop --loop-owner=caller` returns a read-only pass to the caller that owns fixes/re-review. Create triage, review, validation and re-review todo tasks first; apply the carried `review-policy` contract for LOW deferral and user-approved bounded extensions. Non-review modes and terminal findings validation keep their own dispatch.

**Goal:** Ensure every shipped performance fix removes a measured or static-risk-labeled bottleneck across data access, compute, runtime/GC, network, client delivery, and concurrency/resilience; calibrate every number against a known anchor, preserve behavior/authorization/semantics, prove before/after evidence, pass `/why-review` before any fix, and complete a clean full Phase-0 re-review — never hide waste or break correctness.

**Summary:**

- **Main path:** detect scope → discover local patterns → measure or label static risk → review all applicable performance dimensions → calibrate severity → plan → validate findings → fix at the owning layer → prove before/after → run a fresh full re-review.
- **Gates:** count rows before row size; bound memory, queues and concurrency; preserve authorization and semantics. Round 1 clears all validated findings, with a LOW-only fix set reviewed after the fix (LOW deferral). Round 2 clears CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM and defers LOW; failed binary gates always block.
- **`--report-only`:** read-only leaf mode for a caller that owns every fix — Phases 0–6 only, no nested sub-agents, no writer beyond the report; see [Report-Only Mode](#report-only-mode---report-only).

**Workflow:** Detect scope → discover local patterns → measure or label static risk → run 12 serial dimension passes → findings and severity → plan → validate findings → fix → run a full re-review.

**Key Rules:** Evidence beats intuition; calibrate numbers against the local performance reference; bound rows, memory, queues, and concurrency; Round 1 fixes every open validated severity (LOW deferral), while Round 2 fixes only CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM and defers LOW-only findings; failed binary gates always block.

> **[IMPORTANT]** MANDATORY MUST ATTENTION stay project-generic: discover local stack, conventions, query APIs, index definitions, metrics, and report paths before judging.
>
> **AI surface?** Only if the change creates or changes a model call, prompt, agent, tool/MCP, retrieval or eval (see `node .claude/scripts/ai-signal-scan.cjs`): apply `AE-4`, `AE-5` (context budget, caching layout, timeouts, cost caps) from `.claude/skills/shared/protocols/ai-engineering-gate.md` and route depth to `/ai-engineering-review`; otherwise skip this line.
> **[IMPORTANT]** MANDATORY MUST ATTENTION prove every performance claim with measurement or static evidence: `file:line`, query text/shape, row counts, query plan/explain output, trace, profile, or logs.
> **[IMPORTANT]** MANDATORY MUST ATTENTION review performance one dimension at a time — ALL **12**: (1) query shape/over-fetching, (2) index/access path/data topology, (3) N+1 fan-out, (4) aggregation/join shape, (5) materialization/memory, (6) write path/locks/transactions, (7) caching, (8) API payload/frontend delivery/Core Web Vitals, (9) in-process compute/algorithmic complexity, (10) network/protocol round trips, (11) runtime/memory/GC pauses, (12) distributed resilience/load management (timeouts, retries, queue bounds). NEVER stop at 9 — 10-12 are the layers a code-only reading habitually never opens.
> **[IMPORTANT]** MANDATORY MUST ATTENTION include in-process compute, not just I/O: flag O(n²)+ nested scans, linear membership lookups inside loops, ReDoS-prone regex, and per-iteration serialize/clone — CPU bottlenecks need the same evidence rigor as queries.
> **[IMPORTANT]** MANDATORY MUST ATTENTION when an operation is fast but p95/p99 is high, investigate saturation: measure pool/thread acquire-wait and queue depth. Little's Law estimates average demand at the measured pool boundary; validate burst/wait behavior and the sum of per-instance connection budgets against shared-backend limits.
> **[IMPORTANT]** MANDATORY MUST ATTENTION calibrate every number against a known anchor before assigning severity — latency ladder, utilization knee, Core Web Vitals thresholds, hit-ratio math (`references/performance-knowledge.md`); a breached anchor is a HYPOTHESIS to verify with local evidence, NEVER a finding on its own.

> **[PERFORMANCE-FIRST PRINCIPLES — three non-negotiable checks on every hot path, OOM first]**
>
> 1. **[MOST IMPORTANT] Hunt every OOM / out-of-memory bad practice.** Unbounded read-all / `SELECT *` / no page bound, full materialization before paging/filtering, buffering a whole export/report instead of streaming/chunking, loading blobs / large JSON / tracked entities for list views, accidental multiple enumeration, unbounded caches / accumulators / queues / in-memory joins. Triage row **COUNT before row SIZE**, reduce rows **AT THE SOURCE** — a fast query pulling millions of rows still OOMs the process. Bound EVERY result set with a page/limit/cursor or proven business invariant.
> 2. **Right data structure & algorithm for the stack.** Match the structure to the access pattern via the runtime's efficient primitive — O(1) `Set`/`Map`/dict/hash lookup instead of a linear `find`/`includes`/`contains`/`in list` scan inside a loop; no O(n²) where O(n log n) / O(n) / O(1) exists; single-pass min/max/partition instead of redundant re-sort. Prove the complexity class at worst-case N, never by intuition.
> 3. **Batch once, or parallelize — never serial fan-out.** Collapse per-item query / API / cache calls into ONE batched call (`IN` / bulk / aggregate / prefetch dictionary); where independent calls remain, run bounded-parallel with a fresh safe resource per worker instead of sequential awaits — always preserving ordering, authorization, idempotency.

> **Performance Knowledge (calibration constants & domain laws)** — the anchors severity depends on:
>
> - **Latency ladder** `1 ns → 100 ns → 100 µs → 10 ms → 100 ms` (L1 → RAM → SSD → disk seek → intercontinental), each rung ~100-1000×; **~1 ms RTT per 100 km of fiber is a hard floor** no code fix beats.
> - **Measure the local SLO knee** — M/M/1 illustrates mean queue wait `service_time × ρ/(1−ρ)`: 80%→4×, 90%→9×, 95%→19× under its assumptions, not a universal CPU limit. **Little's Law** `L = λ × W` estimates average in-flight work, not a pool-size floor. **Tail amplification** — fan-out to 100 backends hits a p99 ~63% of the time, so a backend p99 becomes the user's median.
> - **Core Web Vitals** LCP ≤2.5 s · INP ≤200 ms · CLS ≤0.1 · TTFB ≤800 ms, measured at **p75 of real users** (field), never a lab score alone.
> - **Cache hit-ratio math** — 90%→99% cuts origin load **10×**; percentiles are NEVER averageable.
>
> **MANDATORY MUST ATTENTION [BLOCKING at the severity/anchor moment]** READ `references/performance-knowledge.md` — full ladder, universal laws, symptom→cause triage matrix, and deep tables for network/protocol, DB engine + isolation + sharding, caching, web/CWV, memory/GC, distributed resilience, measurement rigor. The read is REQUIRED — never optional — before you **assign a severity** or **quote/compare any anchor constant**; NEVER assign a severity or cite an anchor from memory or from the 4-bullet digest above. A scope-narrowed review that assigns no severity and quotes no constant may proceed on the digest alone. — why: the digest orders hypotheses but only the body carries the thresholds severity depends on, and quoting a constant without measuring THIS system is the guess-as-fact failure this skill exists to prevent.

## Detailed Summary

Read [Architecture-Altitude Performance Review](#architecture-altitude-performance-review) when judging a design; apply the same evidence gate before recommendations. Before recommending caching, understand query shape, indexes, pagination, batching and data volume; completion requires measured hit ratio and a bound.

<target>$ARGUMENTS</target>

## Report-Only Mode (`--report-only`)

> **Use when** a caller runs this skill as a read-only leaf — e.g. a workflow parallel review barrier over a plan or design, or a review batch — and another step owns every fix. `--report-only` in `$ARGUMENTS` selects it; review-only is the default; standalone `--fix-loop` alone runs repair/restart phases.
>
> **MANDATORY — when `--report-only` is passed, read `.claude/skills/workflow-review-changes/references/caller-mode.md` § `--report-only` in full FIRST.** It holds the rules every read-only leaf shares (no fix or restart, scope from the caller's brief, no nested fan-out, no user questions, write only the report, return contract); the rules below are this skill's own.
>
> 1. **Run Phases 0–6 only.** A plan or design target uses the Architecture-Altitude lens with `static risk` labels. Phase 5 becomes the report's recommended optimization plan — no code, plan, or artifact edit. Phase 6 `/why-review --validate-findings` still validates every finding. **Phase 7 does not run:** return the validated report; the caller owns fixes and any re-review. — why: two writers of one artifact inside a barrier race each other.
> 2. **No nested fan-out.** Skip Sub-Agent Routing and size-capped batching; review sequentially in this context.
>
> For this mode the declared step order ends at Phase 6; stopping there is the mode's contract, not a skipped step.

## Phase 0: Detect Scope

Classify before analysis. Detection drives dimensions, evidence, sub-agent choice.

| Scope               | Signals                                                                                         | Primary evidence                                                                                |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| DB read             | slow query, full scan, sort spill, high rows examined                                           | query text/ORM expression, row count, plan/explain, indexes                                     |
| DB write            | slow save, lock waits, per-row updates, transaction bloat                                       | write loop, batch size, lock/deadlock logs, transaction scope                                   |
| N+1/fan-out         | loop with query/API call, lazy loading, per-item lookup                                         | caller trace, query count, loop source                                                          |
| API latency         | high p95/p99, timeout, slow endpoint/job                                                        | trace/profile/logs, call chain                                                                  |
| Saturation/Queueing | high p99 while the operation itself is fast, pool exhausted/timeout, threads blocked on acquire | pool active/idle/pending, acquire-wait time, threads/workers vs pool size, replica count × pool |
| Memory/OOM          | large materialization, blobs, no paging, buffering                                              | allocation profile, result size, collection loads                                               |
| Frontend            | slow render, huge bundle, repeated fetch, DOM churn                                             | browser profile, network waterfall, component/render trace                                      |
| Distributed         | message lag, cross-service waterfall, retry storm                                               | trace spans, queue metrics, consumer/producer chain                                             |
| Compute/CPU         | hot loop, nested iteration, quadratic scaling, regex stall, heavy serialize/clone               | input N, operation count vs N, profiler/flame-graph sample, microbench                          |
| Network/protocol    | chatty call count, per-request handshake, no keep-alive, large payload, cross-region hop        | call count × RTT, connection reuse state, TLS/DNS timing, payload size, HTTP version            |
| Runtime/GC          | latency spikes uncorrelated with load, pauses, RSS growth, blocked event loop                    | GC log/pause histogram, allocation rate, RSS vs heap, thread states, event-loop lag             |
| Resilience/load     | retry storm, no timeout, unbounded queue, cold-start blip, one tenant degrades all               | timeout/retry config, queue depth AND age, breaker state, per-tenant rate limits                |

Skip reason allowed only when target explicitly narrows scope and evidence proves dimension irrelevant.

**Triage accelerator (symptom → usual cause).** MUST ATTENTION use the symptom→cause matrix in `references/performance-knowledge.md` §3 to pick the FIRST evidence to pull — it maps signatures AI habitually misreads, e.g. `p99 bad + p50 fine` → GC pause / lock contention / fan-out tail / cold cache (NOT a slow query); `latency scales with result size` → N+1; `sudden cliff at some load` → utilization knee or pool exhaustion; `degrades over days, fine after restart` → leak/bloat/connection leak; `slow for one tenant only` → hot key/partition skew. NEVER let the matrix replace evidence — it orders the hypotheses, Phase 2 proves one.

## Architecture-Altitude Performance Review

> **When to apply:** design/architecture reviews (e.g. `architect` agent) — judge performance as a **structural property of the design** BEFORE it ships, not a tactical query fix after a bottleneck appears. Dimension passes stay the tactical tool; this section is the design-level lens.

Evaluate the **layer model** as a design concern, not a symptom site:

```
Performance as architecture
├── Database  — data access shape baked into the model (projection, paging, N+1 surface, index strategy, partition/shard key)
├── API       — serialization/processing cost, batched vs per-item queries, response-DTO contracts
├── Network   — payload size & call-count designed into the contract (batch endpoints vs chatty waterfalls), endpoint placement vs RTT budget
├── Frontend  — bundle/lazy-load topology, change-detection/list-keying/virtual-scroll as default architecture
├── Runtime   — allocation profile & collector choice, event-loop discipline, pool sizing, working-set target
└── Background jobs — bounded parallelism (local concurrency-limited primitive) + bulk write (local batch API) as the shape, not an afterthought
```

Architecture-altitude rules (decide at design time — cheapest to fix here):

- **Bound every result set and project only needed columns/fields in the contract itself** — never design an unbounded read-all or `SELECT *` endpoint; unbounded reads spike memory/latency under real data volume.
- **Design out N+1 at the boundary** — eager-load / batch-fetch is the default access pattern; per-item lookups are a design smell, not a tuning detail.
- **Caching is a design decision, not a patch** — choose request-scope memoization vs bounded shared cache up front, with key dimensions (tenant/user/auth/version), TTL/invalidation, size limits, privacy constraints specified; never cache to hide an unbounded query.
- **Async I/O is structural** — never design a path blocking threads with `.Result`; bounded parallelism for fan-out is part of the design, with a fresh safe scope/context per worker.
- **Make the cost visible** — design slow-operation + query logging in from the start so regressions are observable in production.
- **Size pools and parallelism, never default them** — estimate average in-use demand using Little's Law (arrival-rate × resource hold-time at the same boundary), then validate burst/wait behavior and dependency limits. Shorten unnecessary _hold-time_ before growing the pool; validate fleet-wide connection budgets (sum of per-instance pools) against shared-backend capacity — local tuning can overload a shared dependency.
- **Budget the round trips and the geography in the contract** — count `call count × RTT` for every designed interaction and place the endpoint (edge/region/replica) against the latency budget; ~1 ms RTT per 100 km and a 2-RTT TCP+TLS handshake are floors no later optimization removes, so a chatty contract or a distant endpoint is a permanent design cost, not a tuning detail.
- **Design the load-management controls in, not on** — a decreasing timeout budget per hop, backoff + full jitter + retry budget + idempotency keys, breaker/bulkhead/shedding, and a BOUND on every queue belong in the design; leave them out and the system amplifies its own partial failures. Reserve headroom below the measured SLO boundary and validate scaling indicators against the limiting resource and warmup delay; queue depth/concurrency can lead aggregate CPU.
- **Choose the runtime cost profile deliberately** — allocation rate and collector choice set the tail (GC pauses are correlated fleet-wide and invisible in the mean); an event-loop runtime must keep CPU work off the loop by design; state the working-set target so the RAM/page-cache cliff is a known bound, not a surprise.

DB index strategy at design time → dimension 2 below (composite key order, covering/partial indexes, write-cost analysis). The tactical evidence gate (measure baseline, prove with plan/explain) still applies to every recommendation at this altitude.

---

## Phase 1: Discover Local Context

MANDATORY discovery before findings (MUST ATTENTION):

- ALWAYS search local standards: `performance`, `index`, `query`, `pagination`, `projection`, `database`, `profiling`, `cache`, `timeout`, `retry`, `pool`, `contributing`, `style guide`.
- search 3+ similar local query/API patterns before proposing a fix.
- read target code and index/migration/schema files controlling the queried data.
- map callers and frequency using available graph/call-trace/profiler tools; if none exist, use grep/import/call hierarchy. Optional: when the hot-path fan-out is hard to see by grep and `.code-graph/graph.db` exists, a graph blast-radius pass (`trace --direction downstream` on the hot path) can hint at the fan-out (it may be stale — verify by reading) — see the Graph-Assisted Investigation advice below.
- identify data shape: tenant/security-review filters, cardinality, expected max rows, selected columns/fields, sort, joins, aggregation/grouping, cache keys, partition/shard key, primary vs replica routing.
- ALWAYS discover the local **SLA/budget** (latency target, page-size cap, throughput/SLO) before judging any number — the local budget outranks every anchor in `references/performance-knowledge.md`.
- ALWAYS read the local resilience + delivery configuration the new dimensions rest on: HTTP client/keep-alive and pool settings, timeout/retry/breaker policy, queue and consumer bounds, rate limits, GC/runtime and container memory limits, CDN/asset caching headers, and whatever RUM/field-metrics source exists.
- NEVER hardcode project names, repository paths, ID formats, DB engines, ORMs, runtime/GC flags, HTTP clients, or framework defaults; derive every one from discovered files.

---

## Phase 2: Baseline Evidence

For capacity/load or cache-placement work, apply `SYNC:measured-capacity-engineering`: disclose workload and offered/achieved demand, attribute resource pressure, preserve cache correctness, and verify cold-state/overload recovery. Read `references/performance-knowledge.md` §10.1 and §6.1 when designing those experiments.

Prefer runtime proof. If unavailable, label finding `static risk` and include exact command/query needed to verify.

MANDATORY baseline for DB findings:

- ALWAYS capture query source: `file:line` and generated SQL/query/ORM expression when available
- ALWAYS capture volume: input size, rows matched, rows returned, rows examined/scanned, page size/limit
- ALWAYS capture access path: query plan/explain, used index, sort/group strategy, join method when available
- ALWAYS capture timing: p50/p95/p99, elapsed query time, query count, allocation or response size
- ALWAYS capture context: endpoint/job/consumer frequency and worst-case fan-out

MANDATORY baseline for compute/CPU findings:

- ALWAYS capture input size N and the growth assumption (expected and worst-case N)
- ALWAYS capture operation count vs N (constant / linear / quadratic+) and the nested-loop or repeated-scan source `file:line`
- ALWAYS capture timing: microbench / `console.time` / profiler or flame-graph sample at representative AND worst-case N

MANDATORY baseline for saturation/pooling findings:

- ALWAYS capture offered concurrency and arrival rate (RPS / worker count / threads.max)
- ALWAYS capture resource hold-time vs total request time (a connection/lock/permit is held only for the fraction it is actually used, not the whole request)
- ALWAYS capture pool state: size, active/idle/pending, and acquire-wait time / queue depth at the pool entrance
- ALWAYS capture aggregate demand on shared dependencies: replica count × per-instance pool → total connections/cores the shared backend must serve

MANDATORY calibration + measurement rigor on EVERY baseline (`references/performance-knowledge.md` §1-2, §10):

- ALWAYS state which anchor the number violates (ladder rung, utilization knee, CWV threshold, hit-ratio target) — a raw number with no anchor cannot carry a severity.
- ALWAYS report distributions, never means: p50/p90/p99/p99.9 + max, segmented by endpoint/tenant/region. NEVER average percentiles across instances or windows — aggregate histograms instead.
- ALWAYS name the load model behind any throughput/latency number: open-model (arrival-rate) exposes queueing collapse, closed-model (fixed VUs) can reduce offered demand as responses slow; flag suspected **coordinated omission** when a tool reports an implausibly clean tail.
- ALWAYS state data volume and cache state of the measurement — toy data or warm-only results cannot establish production or cold-cache capacity; use soak/endurance to expose leaks, fragmentation, and bloat. **Produce that volume with the project's seeder** — `seed-test-data` exposes a configurable count built for exactly this (self-test the cases AND enrich volume); measure at ≥2 volumes ~10× apart so a super-linear curve is visible, and demand realistic **shape** (distribution, cardinality, skew), since uniform rows hide the skew that breaks real hot paths.
- ALWAYS warm up (JIT + caches), measure steady state, repeat, and name the environment before comparing to a baseline; NEVER present a microbenchmark as system behavior.
- NEVER quote an anchor from the reference as a project requirement — local SLA/spec/config wins; the anchor calibrates, it does not govern.

Confidence:

| Confidence | Action                                                |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| 95%+       | Recommend fix freely.                                 |
| 80-94%     | Recommend with caveats and verification command.      |
| 70-79%     | List unknowns first; gather more evidence before fix. |
| <70%       | STOP. Do not recommend.                               |

---

## Phase 3: Serial Dimension Passes

MANDATORY apply one focused pass per dimension. NEVER scan all dimensions at once. **12 dimensions** — 1-9 are the in-process/data-access core, 10-12 cover the layers a code-only reading habitually skips (network round trips, runtime/GC, resilience under load). `references/performance-knowledge.md` carries deep tables for network/protocol (§4), database (§5), caching (§6), web/CWV (§7), memory/GC (§8), and distributed resilience (§9); the remaining dimensions calibrate against the ladder, universal laws, and triage matrix (§1-3) instead of a dedicated table.

### 1. Query Shape And Data Minimization

**Think:** Which rows/columns load? Are filters, projection, sorting, and limits executed by data source before materialization?

MUST ATTENTION find:

- unbounded list/read-all APIs without page, limit, cursor, or bounded business invariant
- filter after materialization (`ToList`/array/load-all before `Where`/filter)
- projection after materialization; full entity/document loaded for list/summary view
- unused includes/joins/lookup data; large text/blob/json fields in list queries
- client-side sort/group/distinct; offset pagination on very deep pages where cursor/keyset fits better
- missing tenant/auth/status/date filters in hot-path queries

Prefer fixes: push predicates to data source, select only needed fields, bound result set, use cursor/keyset for deep sequential access, keep reusable predicates near domain/query-owner layer discovered locally.

### 2. Index, Access Path And Data Topology

**Think:** Can existing indexes satisfy equality/range filters, joins, sort, grouping, and projection in the actual query order? **Sargability first:** for EVERY filter/join predicate, is the indexed COLUMN left bare, or is it wrapped in a function/transformation that the DB must compute per row (killing the index)? Then: does the query reach the data through the right partition/shard/replica?

> **MUST ATTENTION — Non-sargable predicate spot-check (any ORM/SQL).** A function, cast, concatenation, date extraction, or leading-wildcard predicate on a column can prevent an ordinary index seek; expression indexes and optimizer support depend on the actual database. Inspect the translated query and actual collation/normalization rules before proposing a rewrite. For case-insensitive comparisons, use a database-supported collation/operator or a normalized indexed column/expression index only after proving equivalent results. Moving normalization to the parameter alone or listing a few casing variants does not preserve arbitrary mixed-case or Unicode matches. Preserve tenant/auth filters, null behavior, locale, Unicode normalization and result sets with representative fixtures before measuring performance. Verify improvement separately with `EXPLAIN`/the query plan and representative load; a sequential scan can be optimal for low selectivity and is not by itself proof of a defect.

Find:

- no index for high-cardinality filters, joins, foreign keys, sort columns, or frequent group keys
- composite index field order mismatched with equality -> range -> sort access pattern
- **non-sargable predicate: an indexed column wrapped in a function/cast/concat/date-part/transformation** (see spot-check above) — the single most common silent index-loss; also incompatible type/collation, leading wildcard, broad `OR`, negative predicate, or low selectivity
- sort spill/filesort because index order does not match filter + order by
- covering/partial/filtered index opportunity for hot narrow query
- index bloat from adding every field without write-cost analysis
- **leftmost-prefix violation** — a query filtering only on the SECOND column of a composite index gets no seek from it
- **selectivity not established** — "add an index" proposed without the selectivity number; above ~5-20% selectivity a sequential scan legitimately beats random index lookups
- **stale statistics** — plan/explain shows estimated rows far from actual rows; the plan is wrong for a reason no rewrite fixes (refresh stats/analyze first)
- **partition pruning lost** — partitioned table queried without the partition key, so every partition is scanned
- **shard/partition key skew** — monotonic (timestamp/auto-increment) or low-cardinality key creating a hot shard/partition; per-partition throughput ceilings hit by one key
- **replica read correctness-vs-lag** — read-your-writes broken by replication lag, or a lag-sensitive read pointed at a replica
- random-UUID primary key destroying index locality and inflating index size (time-ordered UUIDv7/ULID fits)

Prefer fixes: add/adjust smallest useful index, reorder composite keys to match query, rewrite predicate to be sargable, refresh statistics, carry the partition/shard key into the predicate, salt or re-key a hot partition, route lag-sensitive reads to primary (or a sticky/LSN-aware window), verify with plan/explain before/after, include write-cost risk. **Escalate in order — tune query/index → cache → vertical → read replicas → partition → shard**; NEVER propose sharding before the earlier rungs are proven exhausted (why: resharding and cross-shard joins are the most expensive reversal in the ladder).

### 3. N+1 And Fan-Out

**Think:** Does work scale with item count instead of request/job count?

Find:

- query/API/cache call inside loop, map, serializer, resolver, template/render loop, event handler loop
- per-item existence/count lookup; per-item lazy-loaded relation
- repeated same lookup with different IDs that could be one `IN`/batch/group query
- nested fan-out across services, queues, jobs, or retries
- sequential awaits where independent calls can batch or run bounded parallel with separate safe resources

Prefer fixes: batch IDs once, join/include only needed fields, prefetch dictionaries, aggregate counts in one query, use bounded concurrency, preserve ordering/authorization semantics.

### 4. Aggregation, Join, And Pipeline Shape

**Think:** Does the pipeline reduce data before expensive join/unwind/group/sort/window stages?

Find:

- join/unwind/group before selective filter
- cartesian joins or duplicate expansion not collapsed
- grouping/sorting without pre-filter or supporting index
- aggregation loads all related rows/documents when only existence/count/min/max needed
- repeated post-processing that database can compute safely

Prefer fixes: filter early, project early, aggregate at source, reduce join cardinality, use existence/count queries, repeat necessary post-expansion filters when array/child semantics require it.

### 5. Materialization And Memory

**Think:** What enters memory? Is it bounded, streamed, and tracking-free when read-only?

Find:

- large collection materialized before paging/filtering
- read-only queries tracking entities/objects unnecessarily
- blob/file/large JSON fields loaded for lightweight responses
- buffering entire export/report when streaming/chunking fits
- accidental multiple enumeration re-running query

Prefer fixes: page/chunk/stream, use no-tracking/read-only mode when local stack supports it, project lightweight DTOs, move filter before load, memoize intentionally.

### 6. Write Path, Locks, And Transactions

**Think:** Does write work batch safely and keep locks/transactions small?

Find:

- per-row save/update/delete inside loop
- long transaction wrapping remote calls or heavy reads
- unnecessary unique checks per row instead of bulk validation
- lock escalation/hot-row contention/counter updates without batching
- parallel writes sharing unsafe session/context/unit-of-work
- **long-running or idle-in-transaction connection** — under MVCC it pins old row versions and drives bloat/vacuum pressure fleet-wide (a slow-motion outage, not a local slowdown)
- **isolation level mismatched to the invariant** — lost update at Read Committed, or write skew at Snapshot/Repeatable Read where Serializable (or an explicit lock/version column) is required; read-modify-write done in application code instead of one atomic `UPDATE`
- inconsistent lock acquisition ORDER across code paths (deadlock source), or no retry on the deadlock error
- schema/migration change taking a blocking lock proportional to table size instead of an online pattern (nullable add → batched backfill → `NOT VALID` constraint → validate; concurrent index build; expand/contract)
- durability setting silently traded for throughput without the trade named (fsync/commit-sync relaxation)

Prefer fixes: bulk write, chunk, shorten transaction, move remote calls outside transaction, use idempotent commands, create fresh safe scope/context per parallel worker, pick the isolation level the invariant needs (or an explicit `FOR UPDATE`/version column), make write conflicts atomic in one statement, order lock acquisition consistently and retry deadlocks, use the online migration pattern for large tables.

### 7. Cache And Reuse

**Think:** Is repeated expensive work stable, safe to reuse, and invalidated correctly?

Find:

- same lookup repeated within request/job
- hot reference data fetched every request
- cache key missing tenant/user/auth/filter/version dimensions
- cache hides unbounded query or stale security-sensitive data
- **no cache-value evidence** — measure hit rate and work avoided: at fixed demand, 90%→99% reduces miss traffic 10×. Value also depends on miss cost, key cardinality, memory and consistency cost.
- **stampede/thundering-herd exposure** — hot key expiring sends every request to origin at once; no single-flight/request-coalescing, no per-key lease, no TTL jitter, or a whole key class expiring simultaneously
- **cold-start blindness** — post-deploy/failover empty cache indistinguishable from an origin outage; no warming and no LB slow-start
- unbounded cache (a memory leak with a friendly name): no size bound, no entry lifetime, no eviction policy matched to access skew — and **cache thrash** once the working set exceeds cache size (a cliff, not a slope)
- missing negative caching, so nonexistent keys generate repeated miss-storms
- schema/build version absent from the key, so a deploy can serve poisoned entries

Prefer fixes: request-scope memoization first, then bounded shared cache with explicit key, TTL/invalidation, size limits, privacy constraints, and hit/miss metrics. Add single-flight + TTL jitter for hot keys, stale-while-revalidate where staleness is acceptable, negative caching (or a Bloom filter) for absent keys, a version segment in the key, and an eviction policy matched to the access skew (LRU default, LFU/W-TinyLFU for skewed). NEVER treat "we added a cache" as a completed fix without the measured hit ratio and the bound.

### 8. API Payload, Frontend Delivery And Rendering

**Think:** Does the user-perceived time come from payload size, render/interaction work on the main thread, or asset delivery? Judge against the Core Web Vitals thresholds at **p75 of real users**, never a single lab run.

Find:

- endpoint returns more payload than the view needs; response DTO shaped by the table, not the screen
- **CWV breach** — LCP > 2.5 s, INP > 200 ms, CLS > 0.1, TTFB > 800 ms (`references/performance-knowledge.md` §7)
- **long task > 50 ms** blocking the main thread (destroys INP); CPU-bound work never yielded or moved to a Worker
- **layout thrashing** — interleaved DOM read/write forcing a synchronous reflow per iteration
- animation on layout-triggering properties (width/top/left) instead of compositor-only `transform`/`opacity`
- **CLS source** — image/ad/embed with no reserved space (`width`/`height`/`aspect-ratio`); FOIT from missing `font-display`
- render-blocking synchronous CSS/JS in `<head>`; critical CSS not inlined
- **JS weight/parse cost** — the most expensive byte class (parse + compile + execute, unlike an image); no code splitting, no route-level lazy load, no tree-shaking
- **third-party scripts** loaded eagerly (tag managers, chat, analytics) — habitually the #1 regression source
- repeated fetch, client-side request waterfall (N+1 over HTTP), missing list virtualization, unstable render keys/track-by
- hydration cost scaling with component count; rendering strategy (CSR/SSR/streaming/SSG/islands) never chosen as a performance decision
- HTTP caching wrong: assets not hashed+immutable, HTML not revalidated, `Vary` incorrect (cache poisoning), no Brotli/gzip on text
- missing resource hints where they pay (`preconnect` saves DNS+TCP+TLS, `preload` for late-discovered critical assets, `fetchpriority`)

Prefer fixes: shape the payload to the view, batch/aggregate server-side, break or yield long tasks, batch DOM reads then writes, animate compositor-only properties, reserve space for media, defer third-party and cold routes, virtualize long lists, stabilize keys, hash+immutable asset caching with correct `Vary`, Brotli text compression, AVIF/WebP + `srcset` + lazy below-fold. ALWAYS confirm with a browser profile/network waterfall AND field (RUM/CrUX) data — a lab score locates the cause, field data defines the truth.

### 9. Compute And Algorithmic Complexity

**Think:** Does in-process work grow super-linearly with input size, independent of any query or network call?

MUST ATTENTION find:

- nested iteration over the same/related collection (O(n²)+): loop-in-loop, `map` inside `map`, repeated full re-scan
- linear membership/lookup inside a loop — `.find`/`.includes`/`.indexOf`/`in list`/`.contains` where a `Set`/`Map`/dict gives O(1)
- wrong data structure for the access pattern: array used as a keyed store; repeated `.filter().length` for existence
- string built by concatenation in a loop; repeated `JSON.parse`/`stringify`/deep-clone/serialize per iteration
- catastrophic-backtracking regex on user- or attacker-sized input (ReDoS — cross-link `/security-audit`)
- pure-CPU result recomputed every call when inputs are stable (memoization candidate, distinct from data cache)
- redundant sort/re-sort, or sorting when a single-pass min/max/partition suffices

Prefer fixes: build a `Set`/`Map`/dict index once and look up in O(1); hoist invariant work out of the loop; accumulate into an array + single `join` instead of `+=`; precompute/memoize stable pure results; anchor/bound regex and cap input length; pick the data structure that matches the access pattern. Prove with a microbench/profiler sample at representative AND worst-case N — never reasoning alone.

### 10. Network And Protocol Efficiency

**Think:** How many round trips does this path cost, and what is the RTT floor it can never beat? Count calls × RTT before optimizing anything inside a single call.

MUST ATTENTION find:

- **per-request connection setup** — no keep-alive/connection pooling/reused client, so every call pays TCP (1 RTT) + TLS (1-2 RTT) + possibly cold DNS; the single largest and most common network defect
- **chatty contract** — many small sequential remote calls where one batch endpoint or server-side aggregation fits; call count grows with items (network N+1, distinct from DB N+1)
- **RTT floor ignored** — latency budget already consumed by geography (~1 ms per 100 km) or cross-region hops, with a code-level fix proposed instead of an edge/replica/CDN move
- payload not compressed (no Brotli/gzip on text), or over-large for the consumer; critical response exceeding the ~14 KB initial congestion window when first-round-trip delivery matters
- protocol left on the table: HTTP/1.1 head-of-line blocking with 6-conn/origin limits, domain sharding retained under HTTP/2 (now an anti-pattern), lossy/mobile path that would benefit from HTTP/3/QUIC
- small-write RPC path suffering Nagle + delayed-ACK (~40 ms stalls) without `TCP_NODELAY`
- **infra exhaustion limits unchecked** — file descriptors, listen backlog, ephemeral ports (~28k default), `TIME_WAIT` accumulation, conntrack table, NAT/SNAT ports: these present as "random" latency or errors, never as a slow function
- load balancing weak: naive round-robin where least-connections/power-of-two-choices fits, no health check or outlier ejection, **no slow-start for new instances** (a cold node given full traffic times out)
- sticky sessions used where stateless + external session store fits, blocking rebalancing

Prefer fixes: reuse connections (keep-alive + pooled clients), collapse chatty calls into one batch/aggregate endpoint, move the endpoint closer (edge/CDN/regional replica) when RTT is the floor, compress and shrink payloads, enable the protocol version that matches the path, raise/verify the OS and infra limits, and configure LB algorithm + health checks + slow-start. ALWAYS quantify as `call count × RTT` before and after — why: a faster handler behind 12 avoidable round trips is not a fix.

### 11. Runtime, Memory And GC

**Think:** Does the runtime itself inject latency the code cannot see — collector pauses, allocation pressure, a blocked event loop, memory that never returns?

MUST ATTENTION find:

- **GC pause as a tail-latency source** — latency spikes uncorrelated with load, invisible in the mean and correlated across the fleet; allocation RATE (not heap size) driving collection frequency
- heap mis-sized: too small → continuous GC; too large → long pauses and swap risk; no headroom left for off-heap/native buffers/thread stacks
- **managed-language leak shapes** — unbounded caches, un-removed listeners/subscriptions, closures capturing large scopes, static collections, thread-locals on pooled threads
- **RSS ≠ heap confusion** — container/pod killed on RSS while heap looks healthy (fragmentation, native buffers, ~1 MB per thread stack)
- swap active on a latency-sensitive service (prefer fail-fast OOM over swap thrash); page cache double-buffered against an app cache
- **working-set cliff** — data outgrowing L3 → RAM → page cache, producing a step change rather than a gradual slope
- **blocked event loop / blocking call in an async path** — one CPU-bound task stalling every connection; `.Result`/`.await`-blocking on a thread-pool thread
- thread/worker pool mis-sized for the workload class (CPU-bound ≈ cores; I/O-bound ≈ `cores × (1 + wait/compute)`)
- contention shaped wrong: one coarse global lock (the Amdahl serial section) where sharded/striped locks, lock-free counters, or immutable/copy-on-write data fit
- cache-line issues on genuinely hot paths: false sharing on adjacent hot counters, NUMA-remote allocation (~2× local), random access where sequential is available (10-100× on the same bytes)

Prefer fixes: cut allocation rate before tuning the collector, right-size the heap with headroom, bound every cache and unregister every listener, measure RSS not heap against the container limit, disable swap for latency-critical services, move CPU work off the event loop, size pools by workload class, reduce lock granularity, and restore sequential access order. Prove with GC-pause histogram, allocation profile, RSS trend, event-loop lag, or off-CPU flame graph — NEVER from code reading alone.

### 12. Distributed Resilience And Load Management

**Think:** Under load or partial failure, does this path degrade gracefully — or amplify the failure? Performance and resilience share the same queues, so a missing timeout is a latency defect.

MUST ATTENTION find:

- **missing or non-decreasing timeout budget** — no timeout anywhere, or a callee timeout ≥ the caller's remaining budget; a hung dependency then exhausts threads/pool and takes the caller down
- **retry amplification** — retries without exponential backoff + FULL JITTER, no cap, no retry budget (≤~10% of traffic), or retries on non-idempotent writes with no idempotency key → a partial outage becomes total
- no circuit breaker on a failing dependency; no bulkhead (shared pool lets one slow dependency consume every thread); no load shedding (slow timeouts served where a fast 429/503 is correct)
- **unbounded queue/buffer** — converts a throughput problem into unbounded latency then OOM; queue AGE not monitored (only depth); no DLQ or poison-message handling; no backpressure propagated to the producer
- **per-item message publish** — producer/consumer emits one message or event per item where one batched message or bulk event fits; broker round trips and consumer invocations then grow linearly with item count (the messaging form of N+1)
- **fan-out tail amplification** — scatter-gather over many backends where a backend p99 becomes the user's median (~63% hit rate across 100 calls); no hedged requests or per-shard timeout
- dual write to DB + broker instead of a transactional outbox/CDC; exactly-once assumed instead of at-least-once + idempotent consumer
- cross-service workflow with no saga/compensation, or 2PC on a latency-sensitive path; consensus/quorum round trips on the hot path
- **wall-clock used for cross-machine ordering** (NTP skew is ms-to-s) instead of monotonic/logical/hybrid clocks; leader action without a fencing token/lease (a GC-paused leader still believes it leads)
- **autoscaling lag** — scaling on lagging CPU rather than a leading indicator (queue depth, concurrency), boot+warmup exceeding the spike, no pre-scale for known events, no headroom below the utilization knee
- **metastable failure risk** — system stays broken after the trigger clears (retry storm + cold cache) with no explicit shedding path to recover
- no per-tenant quota/rate limit (token bucket / leaky bucket / sliding window) — one loud tenant becomes everyone's outage; correlated failure via a shared dependency or shared config push defeating nominal redundancy

Prefer fixes: set a decreasing timeout budget per hop, add backoff+jitter with a retry budget and idempotency keys, add breaker + bulkhead + load shedding, bound every queue and propagate backpressure, reduce fan-out or hedge it, replace dual writes with an outbox, order events by logical clock and fence leaders, autoscale on a leading indicator with headroom, and enforce per-tenant quotas. Prove with timeout/retry config `file:line` + queue depth AND age + breaker state + per-tenant limits — why: these defects are invisible at low load and only surface as the outage they cause.

## Phase 4: Findings And Severity

Finding format:

```markdown
- [Severity] [file:line] [dimension] Problem. Evidence: metric/plan/query count. Impact: user/system effect. Fix: smallest behavior-preserving change. Verify: command/query/metric.
```

Severity:

- Critical: outage/OOM/data corruption risk, unbounded hot path, lock storm, runaway fan-out.
- High: p95/p99 timeout risk, full scan on large/hot table/collection, N+1 on user-visible list, missing page bound.
- Medium: avoidable over-fetch, suboptimal index, repeated lookup, moderate memory waste.
- Low: cleanup with small measurable benefit or future-proofing.

NEVER inflate severity without production-like scale/frequency evidence.

---

## Phase 5: Optimize Plan

Before code changes (MUST ATTENTION):

- present baseline, proposed change, behavior invariants, risks, verification commands, and rollback path.
- preserve functional behavior, authorization, ordering, pagination semantics, consistency, and idempotency.
- inspect affected tests/specs/docs when behavior, SLA, public contract, or limits change.
- NEVER change query semantics only to improve speed unless user approves changed behavior.
- NEVER add broad indexes/caches without write-cost, storage-cost, invalidation, and privacy analysis.

> **Spec-Loop Discipline (Dual-Feedback half — tailored).** Performance is **orthogonal** to functional correctness, so the property/metamorphic generation and the MUTATION-SCORE assertion gate are scoped to functional core-logic and do **NOT** apply here — N/A. Apply only the **dual-feedback half**: when a finding establishes or moves a behavior-defining boundary — an SLA/latency budget (p95/p99 target), a result-set bound, a max-rows/page-size limit, a pool-size assumption — feed it BOTH (a) the **spec** — record the SLA/limit as a §5 invariant / documented constraint so the budget is intended contract, not an undocumented tuning value — AND (b) a **guarding test** — a benchmark/assertion that fails when the budget or bound regresses. A fix that improves the number but leaves the boundary undocumented OR unguarded is **INCOMPLETE**, never a code-only change.

---

## Sub-Agent Routing

Use specialized help when available (never under `--report-only`):

| Detected focus                                                     | Sub-agent                                              |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| DB/query/N+1/memory/backend hot path                               | `performance-optimizer`                                |
| Auth, PII, tenant isolation, sensitive cache keys                  | `security-auditor` first, then `performance-optimizer` |
| Cross-service architecture, caching policy, capacity/SLO trade-off | architecture/performance specialist                    |
| Frontend render/bundle/CWV/network waterfall                       | frontend or performance specialist                     |
| Runtime/GC pauses, allocation profile, pool + event-loop sizing    | `performance-optimizer` (runtime evidence: GC log, allocation profile, RSS trend, off-CPU profile) |
| Timeouts/retries/breakers/queue bounds, resilience under load      | `performance-optimizer` with the resilience config in scope; escalate design-level gaps to `architect` |

Sub-agent prompt MUST include target, detected scope, local context evidence, required dimensions, the calibration anchors in play (`references/performance-knowledge.md`), report path, and "return summary only; write full report incrementally."

---

## Phase 6: Why-Review Findings Validation Gate (MANDATORY when findings exist)

> **Purpose:** Validate performance findings before optimization work. Performance reports overstate easily when evidence is static-only, a plan lacks production-like scale, or a proposed index/cache changes write-cost or data-freshness risk.

**Trigger:** Any performance finding or optimization recommendation (Critical, High, Medium, Low, WARN, or static risk). Skip ONLY when the report's verdict is unconditional PASS with literally zero findings.

**Protocol:**

1. Read own finalized report from `tmp/reports/performance-{date}-{slug}.md` or the exact report path written by the caller.
2. Invoke `/why-review --validate-findings <performance-report-path>`.
3. Read the validation verdict path returned by why-review, expected as `tmp/reports/why-review-validate-{date}.md`.
4. **If why-review demotes/removes any finding:** update the performance report with revised severity, removed false positives, and a `## Why-Review Validation Notes` section.
5. **If why-review confirms all findings:** append `## Why-Review Validation` stating all findings were re-validated against measurement/static evidence.
6. **If the report changed after validation:** re-run this validation gate, maximum 3 validation passes, until the report's remaining findings are validated or zero findings remain.

**Skip conditions (record explicit reason if skipping):**

- Verdict is unconditional PASS with zero findings.
- Why-review skill itself is the active context.

---

## Phase 7: Validated Fix + Full Performance Re-Review Loop (MANDATORY when validated findings remain)

**Trigger:** Phase 6 returns CLEAN/validated and the performance report still has one or more findings that must be fixed. Under `--report-only` this phase never runs — the validated report is returned to the caller.

**Protocol:**

1. Create a fresh fix-cycle task list before editing. Do not reuse the review tasks.
2. Fix only findings that survived `/why-review --validate-findings`; if this skill is running inside a workflow, route implementation through the caller's fix step; standalone, apply it with `/fix --target=review`.
3. Re-measure or run the verification command named in the finding.
4. Restart the full `/performance-review` review from Phase 0 over the complete current target, not only the fixed files.
5. The restarted pass MUST create brand-new review tasks, re-detect scope, rediscover local context, rerun baseline/profiler checks (and any optional graph hint) where applicable, and analyze all dimensions again from the beginning.
6. Repeat validate → fix → full performance re-review until a complete pass clears the current round's exit bar (round 1: zero open findings; round 2: zero CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM, LOW deferred).
7. If the same validated blocker repeats across 2 full invocations with no progress, stop and ask the user for a decision.

**Non-negotiable rules:**

- Never fix a performance finding before `/why-review --validate-findings` validates it.
- Never mark performance review clean after a targeted before/after check only; the clean verdict must come from a full Phase 0 restart.
- Never review only fixed files during the recursive pass.
- Never reuse old todo/task items for the recursive review pass.

---

## Output

MANDATORY final report sections:

- Scope and detected bottleneck type
- Baseline evidence and unknowns — each number with the anchor it is calibrated against, the load model behind it, and the dimensions covered vs explicitly skipped (with reason)
- Findings ordered by severity
- Optimization plan and rejected alternatives
- Verification plan with before/after metrics
- Test/spec/doc impact or explicit skip reason
- Confidence and assumptions

If evidence insufficient, output: `Insufficient evidence. Verified: [...]. Not verified: [...]. Next evidence needed: [...].`

<!-- SYNC:systematic-review-batching:reminder -->

**MUST ATTENTION** Triage all files, write a short review plan and create review/validation/fix/re-review tasks first. Choose inline work or authorized specialists from risk, relationships and context headroom; no fixed file/line/byte caps. Persist coverage, reconcile interactions and validate findings before fixes or PASS.

<!-- /SYNC:systematic-review-batching:reminder -->

<!-- SYNC:severity-rubric:reminder -->

- **MANDATORY** Classify every finding Critical/High/Medium/Low by consequence using the affected asset, shipped impact, exposure, reversibility, evidence location, and confidence; Critical/High/MEDIUM remain actionable under the round bar, while LOW is recorded/deferred from round 2 onward.
- **MANDATORY** A finding names a reachable trigger path (caller, input, state or event that reaches the defect) and a consequence; an unreachable concern is an observation, and unsettled reachability is `NOT VERIFIABLE` only when the concern would be MEDIUM or higher (an observation otherwise) — never a speculative LOW.
- **MANDATORY** Keep binary gates separate from severity: a failed test, security must-fix, required artifact, or parity check blocks at every round and is never relabeled LOW.
- **MANDATORY** Score-based skills (sre 0-2, perf two-axis) map onto the same four tiers — no parallel severity vocabulary.

<!-- /SYNC:severity-rubric:reminder -->


<!-- SYNC:category-review-thinking:reminder -->

- **MANDATORY** Derive review categories from file language + directory semantics + change nature; create a sub-task per category.
- **MANDATORY** Derive each category's concerns from first principles with `file:line` evidence — never a fixed checklist.

<!-- /SYNC:category-review-thinking:reminder -->

<!-- SYNC:scenario-stress-eval:reminder -->

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** scenario-stress gate: reuse the scale tier `T0`–`T3` AND derive business-criticality `B0`–`B3` from evidence first — apply the **criticality-signal floor** (regulated/PII/financial/health data · money movement · auth/identity · legal-compliance → at least `B2` even absent SLA docs; do NOT default to `B3`). Select only the scenarios the `B`/`T` combination warrants, then walk each (simulate → trace → failure signature → self-heal/MTTR → trade-off) and assign `WITHSTANDS`/`DEGRADES-GRACEFULLY`/`FAILS-HARD`/`N/A-by-business`/`OVER-HARDENED`. Anti-over-engineering is first-class (a lean system that needs no HA/DR is a PASS) AND symmetric (never under-harden a `B2`+ system for low traffic). **ADVICE-ONLY — emit the Scenario Stress Matrix as guidance; NEVER mutate any score, verdict band, or gate pass/fail.** Full catalog → `.claude/docs/scenario-stress-catalog.md` (authoritative for scenarios/verdicts/business-tiers — on any change update the catalog FIRST, then re-run `inject_scenario_stress_gate.py`; scale tier stays single-sourced in `scale-technique-catalog.md`).

<!-- /SYNC:scenario-stress-eval:reminder -->


<!-- SYNC:goal-contract-satisfaction-loop:reminder -->

- **MANDATORY** Resolve the active Goal Contract BEFORE work (active plan `goal.md` → `<plans root>/goals/{YYMMDD-HHmm}-{slug}/goal.md`, plans root default `plans` and overridable via a `docsRoots.plans.path` entry in `docs/project-config.json` → create from current request) and read saved success criteria before editing.
- **MANDATORY** Append iteration evidence after execution; emit a Goal Satisfaction matrix (PASS/FAIL/BLOCKED) before reporting PASS; loop on validated FAIL; escalate repeated no-progress or blockers. NEVER store secrets in goal files.

<!-- /SYNC:goal-contract-satisfaction-loop:reminder -->

<!-- SYNC:trade-off-interrogation-gate:reminder -->

**Review/audit invocations:** follow `SYNC:review-decision-autonomy` for every decision prompt; choose supported recommendations without asking, preserve round-extension approval and actual authority.

- **MANDATORY MUST ATTENTION ALWAYS ASK THE 3 TRADE-OFF QUESTIONS** — on the thing under review AND on every recommendation you make: (1) **what does it SACRIFICE?** name the dimensions checked (change cost · complexity · perf · coupling · reversibility · migration · ops load · blast radius · security · testability · delivery time · UX) — "none"/"pure win" is an unfinished analysis; (2) **is it worth it?** gain (with a metric) vs cost, WHO pays, WHEN → emit **WORTH IT / NOT WORTH IT / UNCLEAR**; NOT WORTH IT → withdraw or replace it; (3) **is it MATERIAL enough to confirm with the user?** irreversible/one-way door · cost shifted onto another team/ops/maintainer/user · one quality attribute traded for another · a tier/service/event/library boundary crossed · auth/money/data-integrity/breaking-change/High-or-Medium-risk path · verdict UNCLEAR → **STOP and confirm via `ask user question tool` BEFORE the verdict**.
- **MANDATORY** A MATERIAL trade-off with no user confirmation can NEVER be PASS; never bury one as a Low-severity note, never decide it silently, and never let delivery or convergence pressure authorize a one-way door — an un-walked-back one-way door is the user's call, not the reviewer's.
- **MANDATORY — a context that cannot ask escalates BY HANDOFF, never by silence.** `ask user question tool` reaches only the main interactive agent, so a sub-agent or a terminal/verdict-only mode cannot ask. There the duty is REDIRECTED, not waived: still name the trade-off, still decide materiality, record `confirmed? = NO — cannot ask from this context`, and **state the unconfirmed MATERIAL trade-off in your RETURNED verdict so the CALLER escalates it** (a note only in an on-disk report is not a handoff); never emit an unqualified PASS. If you CAN ask, you MUST ask.

<!-- /SYNC:trade-off-interrogation-gate:reminder -->



<!-- SYNC:review-principle-awareness:reminder -->

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** Every review first checks the change context and routes only applicable principles to their detailed protocols: scale-ready foundation, test intent in the project's native format (GWT is one option), AI-agent-as-user access, and UI/component design when relevant. Record evidence-backed apply/adapt/defer/N/A/block/unverified status with owner and next step; do not invent unrelated findings or expand scope.

<!-- /SYNC:review-principle-awareness:reminder -->

**MUST ATTENTION** capacity work: model demand/SLO and distinguish sessions from RPS/in-flight work; disclose load model and offered vs achieved demand; reduce measured work at a safe owner; preserve cache authorization/freshness/bounds; prove cold-state, overload recovery and justified headroom before scaling. Static review returns a verification plan, not invented throughput. Retain the hosting skill's scores, gates and authority.

**MUST ATTENTION** Decide supported review choices and recommendations, record the rationale, and finish without routine user questions. Keep round-limit extension, indispensable facts and actual action authority; preserve source coverage, validation, tests, read-only boundaries and budgets. Review decisions do not accept open risks or make a failed gate pass.

## Closing Reminders

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION Goal:** Ensure every shipped performance fix removes a measured or static-risk-labeled bottleneck across data access, compute, runtime/GC, network, client delivery, and concurrency/resilience; calibrate every number against a known anchor, preserve behavior/authorization/semantics, prove before/after evidence, pass `/why-review` before any fix, and complete a clean full Phase-0 re-review — never hide waste or break correctness.

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION — Main steps:** Detect scope and symptom→cause triage → discover local context and 3+ patterns → baseline evidence and calibrate anchors → run 12 serial dimension passes → order findings by severity → plan the smallest behavior-preserving optimization → validate findings with `/why-review --validate-findings` → fix only validated findings that block the current round and restart the full Phase-0 review (Round 1: all severities; Round 2: CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM; LOW-only deferred; binary gates always block).

- **Evidence and calibration:** measure before/after or label `static risk` with an exact verification command. Read `references/performance-knowledge.md` before severity or anchor comparisons; local SLA/spec wins. An anchor breach is a hypothesis requiring local proof. Apply the confidence table in Phase 2.
- **Coverage:** run all 12 dimensions serially; skip only with explicit scope narrowing and evidence. Count `call count × RTT`, verify connection reuse, and inspect runtime/GC and resilience alongside data access and compute.
- **Hot paths:** reduce rows at the source before projection/caching, bound result sets and memory, verify index usability with query shape and plan/explain, prove worst-case complexity, and batch or use safe bounded parallelism.
- **Measurement:** report segmented distributions, never average percentiles, disclose load model and cache/data state, and measure pool acquire-wait, resource hold-time and fleet dependency budgets. Shorten unnecessary hold-time before growing pools.
- **Fix authority:** validate findings through `/why-review --validate-findings` before fixing. Restart the full Phase-0 review over the complete target after current-round blocking fixes; retain the LOW deferral exception. Under `--report-only`, return the validated report after Phase 6; the caller owns fixes/re-review.
- **Delegation:** tag tasks PAR/SEQ, group PAR tasks into disjoint-write waves, spawn each wave together, and wait for all returns before advancing. `--report-only` forbids fan-out.
- **Local fit and contracts:** search 3+ matching local patterns and inspect schema/index owners. Put changed SLA, result/page bounds or pool assumptions in both a §5 spec invariant and a guarding test/benchmark. Track tasks and finish with a doc/test/spec staleness review.

| Evasion                                       | Rebuttal                                                                                                                                                      |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "Bottleneck obvious, skip baseline"           | No measurement = guess. Capture metric or label static risk with the verify command.                                                                          |
| "Index exists, so query fine"                 | Show plan/explain and access path. Existing unused index proves nothing.                                                                                      |
| "Projection enough"                           | First reduce rows. Loading fewer columns from too many rows still wastes work.                                                                                |
| "Just cache it"                               | Fix query shape/index/bounds first. Cache can hide stale, unsafe, unbounded work.                                                                             |
| "Only one query in code"                      | Trace loops, serializers, resolvers, consumers, and retries. Fan-out often hides upstream.                                                                    |
| "Loop is fine, the list is small"             | Show N and worst-case N. O(n²) that's fine at 10 melts at 10k. Bench at real scale.                                                                           |
| "Query is fast, so the endpoint is fast"      | Measure pool acquire-wait and queue depth. A 2ms query behind a saturated pool still yields a 200ms p99 — the wait is at the pool entrance, not in the query. |
| "Found one similar pattern, good enough"      | Grep 3+ and verify preconditions match. One nearby example ≠ a fit; cite `file:line`.                                                                         |
| "Fix it where it errors/spikes"               | Trace caller (wrong data) vs callee (wrong handling); fix at the layer owning the invariant, not the symptom site.                                            |
| "Validated nothing, just fix the obvious one" | No fix until `/why-review --validate-findings` confirms it; then fix only the current round's blocking severities and restart the FULL review from Phase 0. Round 2 LOW-only findings are deferred. |
| "Every handler is fast, so the path is fast"  | Count `call count × RTT` and check connection reuse. 12 avoidable round trips beat any handler micro-optimization.                                             |
| "Latency is high, optimize the code"          | Check the RTT/geography floor first (~1 ms per 100 km) — physics and handshakes are not fixable in code; only moving the endpoint is.                          |
| "Spikes are random / just noise"              | Correlate against GC pauses, cold cache, deploys, and pool wait before calling anything random. Uncorrelated-with-load spikes are usually the runtime.         |
| "Added a cache, that's the fix"               | Show the measured hit ratio AND the size/TTL bound. Hit ratio alone does not establish value; unbounded is a leak.                                                      |
| "Resilience is not a performance concern"     | A missing timeout, jitterless retry, or unbounded queue IS a latency defect — same queues, and it converts partial failure into total.                         |
| "Lighthouse score is green"                   | CWV verdicts come from field p75 (RUM/CrUX). Lab locates causes; field defines truth.                                                                          |
| "Only 9 dimensions matter, 10-12 are infra"   | 10-12 (network, runtime/GC, resilience) are where code-only reviews are blindest. NEVER drop a dimension without an evidence-backed skip reason.               |
| "Anchor says it's slow, that's the finding"   | An anchor breach is a hypothesis. Promote it with `file:line` + measurement or an explicit `static risk` label and verify command.                             |
| "Digest is enough, skip the references body"  | The digest orders hypotheses; only the body carries the thresholds. NEVER assign a severity or quote an anchor constant from memory or the digest — read it.    |

**[TASK-PLANNING]** Break work into small tracked tasks before starting; keep one `in_progress`, mark each completed after evidence, and include the final doc/test/spec review.


<!-- SYNC:review-policy:reminder -->

**MUST ATTENTION** Triage all targets, plan and create review/validation/fix/fresh re-review tasks first. Review-only reports without edits; fix-loop freshly reviews every repair under one fixing owner. Default cap three rounds: disclose deferred LOWs, ask and wait before a bounded extension for MEDIUM+ or failed required checks. Preserve scope, coverage and actual operation authority.
