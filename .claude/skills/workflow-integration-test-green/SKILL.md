## Quick Summary

**Goal:** [Workflow] Trigger the Integration Test Green workflow — run the WHOLE integration-test suite (or the named target), adjudicate every failure into a written Fault Verdict before any edit, fix at the owning layer, loop until a fresh full verify is green twice in a row with zero failures, then leave the spec TCs, the integration-test reference doc, and the feature docs in sync with the suite that actually exists.

**When to use:** "make all integration tests pass", "fix the failing integration tests", "the suite is red after my change", "loop until all integration tests are green", "diagnose this flaky integration test". For AUTHORING new tests from specs use `/workflow-write-integration-test`; this workflow is for driving an EXISTING suite to green.

**Workflow:**

1. **Detect** — resolve the verification scope: the WHOLE system by default, or the target named in the prompt.
2. **Converge** — loop verify → adjudicate → fix → review the fix → re-verify until zero failures across 2 consecutive runs, bounded by a round cap and a Round Integrity Check.
3. **Sync** — reconcile spec TCs, the integration-test reference doc, and impacted feature docs with the final suite.

**Key Rules:**

- MUST ATTENTION default the verification scope to the **WHOLE SYSTEM** — every integration-test project via `testProjectPattern` > `testProjects` — and pass it EXPLICITLY to `/integration-test-verify`; never fall through to its change-scoped git auto-detect default.
- MUST ATTENTION adjudicate EVERY failure with `/debug-investigate` + `/integration-test-review` (report-only) into ONE written Fault Verdict — `TEST-WRONG` · `TEST-NOT-OPTIMAL` · `SOURCE-WRONG` · `ENVIRONMENT-BLOCKED` · `AMBIGUOUS` — with `file:line` evidence, BEFORE any edit.
- MUST ATTENTION fix at the lowest invariant-owning layer (Entity > Service > Handler), never the crash site; a `SOURCE-WRONG` fix KEEPS or STRENGTHENS the test that caught it.
- MUST ATTENTION run `/changes-review` (INLINE, report-only) on the fix diff of EVERY loop round that landed a fix, folding its validated findings back into that same round — no fix reaches the next round un-code-reviewed.
- MUST ATTENTION back every pass/fail claim with actual test-runner output (Passed/Failed/Skipped counts + failing names) — "all passed" without output is theater.
- MUST ATTENTION treat a shrinking executed-test count, a growing skipped count, or a narrowed scope as a REGRESSION → STOP and escalate; a suite that got greener by losing tests did not converge.
- MUST ATTENTION keep claims evidence-based (`file:line`) with confidence >80% to act.
- MUST ATTENTION keep task tracking updated as each step starts/completes.
- MUST ATTENTION define success criteria before execution (the Goal Contract is set FIRST) and loop until observable verification passes.
- MUST ATTENTION require integration tests to protect a named business rule/invariant and fail if that intent breaks.
- MUST ATTENTION arrange integration-test data through real use cases or valid seeded fixtures; never create impossible state through repository hacks.
- MUST ATTENTION verify integration suites with 2 consecutive passing runs without DB reset before declaring done.
- NEVER force green by weakening or removing assertions, adding skip annotations, widening assertion timeouts, wrapping a retry around a failing assertion, or narrowing the scope.
- NEVER skip mandatory workflow or skill gates.

**IMPORTANT MANDATORY Steps:** /scout -> /integration-test-verify-loop -> /spec [mode=sync] -> /scan --target=integration-tests -> /docs-update -> /workflow-end -> /watzup

> **[BLOCKING]** Each step MUST ATTENTION invoke its `Skill` tool — marking a task `completed` without skill invocation is a workflow violation. NEVER batch-complete validation gates.

> **[CRITICAL] Adjudicate-Before-Fix Gate:** inside `/integration-test-verify-loop`, no edit may land before that failure has a written Fault Verdict backed by `/debug-investigate`'s traced root cause AND `/integration-test-review`'s gate findings. An unadjudicated failure gets "fixed" by whatever is nearest — which is almost always the assertion, and a weakened assertion protects nothing.

> **[CRITICAL] Per-Round Review Gate:** the loop's only convergence signal is "the tests went green" — and a green test cannot see a fix made at the wrong layer, an invariant broken elsewhere, dead code, a leaked domain concept, or a security/performance regression. So EVERY round that lands a fix must run `/changes-review` (INLINE, report-only) over that round's fix diff, validate its findings, and resolve them in the SAME round. A round that leaves a validated review finding open has not finished, even if its tests are green. This subsumes the `SOURCE-WRONG` verdict's own changes-review obligation — once per round over the whole fix diff, never twice, and never as a nested review→fix loop.

> **[CRITICAL] Inline Execution Gate:** `/integration-test-verify-loop` and the skills it drives (`/integration-test-verify`, `/debug-investigate`, `/integration-test-review`, `/changes-review`) run **INLINE via the `Skill` tool — NEVER as sub-agents**. `/debug-investigate` requires its `/why-review` gate in the SAME session/main agent, and `/integration-test-review` self-binds its own fix + re-review obligations; a sub-agent cannot own either or carry it back to the loop. Their OWN internal fan-outs (verify's per-project `integration-tester` agents, review's phase agents) remain sub-agents by their own design, so context stays bounded.

> **[CRITICAL] Documentation Sync Is Part Of Done:** the loop deliberately defers ALL doc work while it churns, so steps 3–5 are not an optional tail. `/spec [mode=sync]` reconciles §8 TCs ↔ the executing test code, `/scan --target=integration-tests` regenerates the integration-test reference doc from the suite as it now stands, and `/docs-update` catches every other impacted doc. A converged-but-undocumented suite leaves the next agent reading a reference doc describing tests that no longer exist.

> **Goal Contract propagation (workflow-owned):** At workflow start — BEFORE round 1 — resolve the active Goal Contract per `SYNC:goal-contract-satisfaction-loop` (active plan `goal.md` → `plans/goals/{YYMMDD-HHmm}-{slug}/goal.md` → create from the request). Its single required Success Criterion: _a fresh full `/integration-test-verify` over the resolved scope reports ZERO failed tests across 2 consecutive runs without a DB reset, with no test deleted, skipped, or weakened to get there._ Record the scope string, the round cap (default 3), and the baseline executed/skipped counts in **Constraints**. After every round, append the per-project counts, Fault Verdicts, and fixes to the Iteration Log; emit the Goal Satisfaction matrix (PASS/FAIL/BLOCKED) before `/workflow-end`.

Activate the `workflow-integration-test-green` workflow. Run `/start-workflow workflow-integration-test-green` with the user's prompt as context.

**Steps:** /scout → /integration-test-verify-loop → /spec [mode=sync] → /scan --target=integration-tests → /docs-update → /workflow-end → /watzup

> **[STEP PURPOSES]** Every step has a distinct purpose — NEVER deduplicate or batch:
>
> **`/scout`** — Resolve the verification scope to a concrete test-project list. No target in the prompt → the WHOLE system (every project via `testProjectPattern` > `testProjects` from `docs/project-config.json` → `integrationTestVerify`). A named suite/module/feature/diff narrows it — state how the target maps to projects. Output: the fixed scope string the loop will reuse every round.
> **`/integration-test-verify-loop`** — The convergence engine, and the only step that changes code. Sets the Goal Contract first, then loops: `/integration-test-verify` INLINE over the fixed scope (2 consecutive green runs, no DB reset, real counts) → on ANY failure run `/debug-investigate` + `/integration-test-review` (report-only) → ONE Fault Verdict per failure → `/fix` at the owning layer → **conditional `/changes-review`** (INLINE, report-only, over the round's fix diff — runs in EVERY round that landed a fix; validated findings fold back into that same round's fix set) → **Round Integrity Check** (executed count must not shrink, skipped count must not grow, scope must not narrow) → fresh full re-verify. Round cap 3; not shrinking across 2 rounds, increasing failures, cap hit with failures open, lost coverage, an open validated review finding, or `ENVIRONMENT-BLOCKED` → STOP and escalate via `AskUserQuestion`. Output: zero-failure runner evidence for both runs + the per-round verdict/fix/review trail.
> **`/spec [mode=sync]`** — Reconcile §8 `TC-{FEATURE}-{NNN}` specs ↔ the executing test code under `docs/specs/`. Update each TC's `CoveredBy` field with **all** covering `{File}::{MethodName}` links (one TC → many tests, 1:N; a test-filter expression when the set is large). Coverage = ≥1 annotation-tagged test; never force one test per TC. Runs AFTER convergence so it syncs the final tests, not intermediate ones.
> **`/scan --target=integration-tests`** — Regenerate the integration-test project-reference doc from the suite as it now stands: patterns, base fixtures, async-wait and unique-data helper conventions, suite/project inventory, and lessons. This is the doc every future agent reads before touching a test — a loop that changed test structure without regenerating it leaves the next agent following stale conventions.
> **`/docs-update`** — Update every OTHER impacted doc: feature-doc evidence fields, version history, and any doc embedding test counts or coverage claims the loop changed. Covers what `/spec [mode=sync]` (spec TCs) and `/scan --target=integration-tests` (the reference doc) do not.
> **`/workflow-end`** + **`/watzup`** — Close workflow state, then summarize the convergence trail and run the final handoff.

**IMPORTANT MANDATORY Steps:** /scout -> /integration-test-verify-loop -> /spec [mode=sync] -> /scan --target=integration-tests -> /docs-update -> /workflow-end -> /watzup

<!-- SYNC:integration-test-execution-discipline -->

> **Integration Test Execution Discipline** — How the integration-test family (write · review · verify) runs, diagnoses, and clears a suite. Binds `/integration-test`, `/integration-test-review`, and `/integration-test-verify` identically.
>
> 1. **Verify the WHOLE system passes — not a hand-picked subset.** `/integration-test-verify` must prove the full relevant suite is green (every test in the system the change can touch), not one cherry-picked test. "All pass" is only true with actual runner output (Passed/Failed/Skipped counts + names) and only after 2 consecutive green runs without a DB reset.
> 2. **Drive state through real use-case paths — NEVER hack seed data.** Set up every precondition exactly as a real user would: real commands, queries, production consumers/messages, or valid idempotent seeders. NEVER create or mutate domain data by direct repository writes — that fabricates states a user could never reach and hides the real workflow bug. Hacking seed data to force a green run is forbidden.
> 3. **On ANY failure → `/debug-investigate` the root cause BEFORE any fix.** Do not guess, do not patch the symptom site. Trace the failure end-to-start and classify whose fault it is: test code (wrong assertion/setup), source/production code (real defect), or environment/infrastructure/data. Then route: test-code fault → `/integration-test-review` to fix the test at the root (never weaken assertions or add skips); source-code fault → fix the production defect at the owning layer and report it; environment fault → mark BLOCKED and point at the startup script. NEVER change a test to match broken code.
> 4. **60-second runtime cap — a slow test is a RED FLAG, not a tuning knob.** Local integration tests run fast. If any single test (or a stalled suite) exceeds ~60s, STOP and treat the slowness itself as a defect signal — deadlock, missing `await`, infinite poll/retry, a real network/external call, or an unbounded query. `/debug-investigate` the cause; NEVER paper over it by raising the timeout or extending the wait.
> 5. **Loop until the whole suite is green.** After fixing the validated root cause, restart the full 2-run verification from run 1. Done means the entire relevant suite passes repeatably — never green-once, never a subset.

<!-- /SYNC:integration-test-execution-discipline -->

<!-- SYNC:test-failure-fault-adjudication -->

> **Test-Failure Fault Adjudication** — When a test fails (or you are debugging or fixing a failure), the job is to determine *who is at fault — the source code or the test code*. Getting that verdict right matters more than turning the suite green. Binds every debug / fix / test skill identically.
>
> 1. **Provisional verdict before touching either side.** Classify the observed evidence as SOURCE-WRONG, TEST-WRONG, TEST-NOT-OPTIMAL, ENVIRONMENT-BLOCKED, or AMBIGUOUS; then `/debug-investigate` and trace end-to-start before editing. A green-again suite is NOT the goal.
> 2. **Triangulate against the spec AND the source.** If a governing Feature Spec covers the behavior (e.g. `docs/specs/**` — §3 ACs / §4 BRs / §5 invariants / §8 TCs), it is the tiebreaker for *intended* behavior — compare BOTH the production source and the failing test against it. With no spec, the documented intent / acceptance criteria / caller contract is the reference. Decide from this evidence whether the SOURCE is wrong or the TEST is wrong.
> 3. **Classify who is at fault, then fix the wrong side at its root:**
>     - **SOURCE-WRONG** — production code violates the spec's intended behavior or a clear invariant → fix the source at the owning layer; keep or strengthen the test that caught it.
>     - **TEST-WRONG** — the test encodes a stale or incorrect assertion, setup, or expectation that contradicts intended behavior → fix the test at its root. NEVER weaken an assertion, add a skip, or relax a timeout to force green.
>     - **TEST-NOT-OPTIMAL** — intended behavior is valid but the test seam, timing, or assertion signal is fragile → improve the test without weakening the invariant.
>     - **ENVIRONMENT-BLOCKED** — infrastructure or external state prevents a source/test verdict → preserve diagnostics and stop mutation until the environment is healthy.
>     - **AMBIGUOUS** — evidence or intended behavior does not safely select an owner → ask the user or canonical owner before editing.
>     - NEVER change a test to match broken source, and NEVER change source to satisfy a broken test. (Migration code excluded — schema/data migrations are one-time execution paths, not core application logic.)
> 4. **Ask the user when intended behavior is unclear.** If no spec covers the behavior, the spec is silent, or the spec is ambiguous about which side is correct, STOP and `AskUserQuestion` (or consult the canonical spec owner) before editing either side — never silently pick source or test just to make the suite pass.
>
> Reconcile to intended behavior, never to whichever side currently passes — green can encode the very bug.

<!-- /SYNC:test-failure-fault-adjudication -->

<!-- SYNC:real-world-fidelity-testing -->

> **Real-World Fidelity Gate** — MANDATORY when authoring, reviewing, or repairing any integration / E2E / system test.
>
> A test earns trust by reproducing a situation the system can actually meet in production. A scenario that could never occur in real life proves nothing when it passes, and wastes hours when it fails.
>
> 1. **Ask the fidelity question BEFORE writing the setup:** *"Can this sequence, timing, and data actually occur in production?"* If no, the test is mis-specified — fix the SCENARIO, never the assertion.
> 2. **Model real pacing between actor steps.** Two distinct actor actions that production separates by seconds, minutes, or hours MUST NOT be fired back-to-back in the same millisecond. Compressed pacing manufactures races the system was never designed to survive, then reports them as product defects.
> 3. **Wait on a real signal, never a blind sleep.** Find an observable proving the prior step finished — a persisted state change, an audit/version stamp, a queue/worker idle marker, a completion event — and poll until it settles (unchanged across a short stability window). Use a fixed delay ONLY when no observable exists, and say so in a comment.
> 4. **Barriers belong in ARRANGE, never in ASSERT.** Waiting for a precondition is fidelity. Widening an assertion's timeout, loosening a comparison, adding a retry around a failing assertion, or skipping the test is masking. NEVER do the latter to force green.
> 5. **Distinguish harness-amplified from real.** Test topologies (shared infra, fan-out consumers, parallel suites, cold starts) can make a rare production race routine locally. Before filing a product defect, state whether the trigger exists in production and at what likelihood.
> 6. **Keep the protected invariant intact.** Improving fidelity must NEVER reduce what the test protects. If a realistic scenario no longer exercises the rule, the rule needs a DIFFERENT realistic scenario — not a weaker assertion.
> 7. **Deliberate impossible-state tests are allowed, but MUST be labelled.** Corruption-repair, migration, and fail-safe tests intentionally construct states production should never reach; comment WHY the state is reachable (upstream bug, partial write, legacy data), so they are never confused with unrealistic setups.

<!-- SYNC:ai-mistake-prevention -->

> **AI Mistake Prevention** — Failure modes to avoid on every task:
>
> **Re-read files after context changes.** Context compaction, resume, or long-running work can make memory stale; verify current files before acting.
> **Verify generated content against source evidence.** AI hallucinates APIs, names, claims, and document facts. Check the relevant source before documenting or referencing.
> **Check downstream references before deleting or renaming.** Removing an artifact can stale docs, generated mirrors, configs, and callers; map references first.
> **Trace the full impact chain after edits.** Changing a definition can miss derived outputs and consumers. Follow the affected chain before declaring done.
> **Verify ALL affected outputs, not just the first.** One green check is not all green checks; validate every output surface the change can affect.
> **Assume existing values are intentional — ask WHY before changing OR flagging one as a defect.** Before changing or reporting a constant, limit, flag, cutoff, wording, or pattern, read nearby context and history, the CALLER's ordering, and 2+ sibling call sites of the same convention. A doc stating WHAT without WHY is missing rationale, not proof of a missing guard.
> **Surface ambiguity before acting — don't pick silently.** Multiple valid interpretations require an explicit question or stated assumption with risk.
> **Assert the outcome your system owns, not the intermediate state your infrastructure owns.** When verifying async work, assert the final business state — never the delivery/retry bookkeeping held in shared infrastructure that any co-running process can write. Such a check passes when run alone and flakes the moment anything else shares that infrastructure.
> **Keep shared guidance role-relevant.** Universal guidance must help every receiving skill or agent; code-specific obligations belong only in code-specific protocols.

## Closing Reminders

**Protocols in force (concise digest of the SYNC/shared blocks this skill carries):** MUST ATTENTION honor every protocol below — each is a signpost to its canonical body above.

- **Integration Test Execution Discipline:** verify the WHOLE system, drive state through real use cases, `/debug-investigate` before any fix, 60s runtime cap, loop until the whole suite is green.
- **Test-Failure Fault Adjudication:** decide WHO is at fault (source vs test) against the governing spec before touching either side; never weaken an assertion or change source to satisfy a broken test.
- **Real-World Fidelity:** a scenario production could never reach proves nothing green and blames the product red; settle barriers belong in ARRANGE, never a widened assertion timeout.
- **AI Mistakes:** holistic-first debug, fix at responsible layer, surgical diff, verify all outputs.
- **Nested Tasks:** expand child phases, link parent workflow row when nested.
- **Project Reference Docs:** read required docs first, cite, `lessons.md` always.
- **Task Tracking:** bootstrap tasks; persist plan/review findings to disk incrementally.
- **Critical Thinking:** traced `file:line` proof, confidence >80%, never guess.
- **Incremental Persistence:** append findings per file to report; never hold in memory.
- **Sub-Agent Return Contract:** sub-agents return summary-only with `Full report:` pointer.

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** break work into small todo tasks using `TaskCreate` BEFORE starting
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** set the Goal Contract FIRST — before round 1 — with the zero-failures / 2-consecutive-green / no-test-lost success criterion
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** the verification scope defaults to the WHOLE SYSTEM and is passed to `/integration-test-verify` EXPLICITLY every round — never let it fall through to change-scoped git auto-detect
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** adjudicate EVERY failure into ONE written Fault Verdict BEFORE any edit — `/debug-investigate` for the traced root cause, `/integration-test-review` (report-only) for the test-side gates
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** every loop round that lands a fix runs `/changes-review` (INLINE, report-only) on that round's fix diff — validated findings fold into the same round; an open validated finding blocks the round even when the tests are green
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** run `/integration-test-verify-loop` and the skills it drives INLINE via the `Skill` tool — NEVER as sub-agents
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** NEVER force green — no weakened assertions, no skips, no widened timeouts, no retries around a failing assertion, no repository-hacked data, no narrowed scope
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** the Round Integrity Check is BLOCKING — a shrinking executed-test count, a growing skipped count, or a narrowed scope is a REGRESSION, not convergence
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** show actual runner output for every pass/fail claim (Passed/Failed/Skipped counts + failing names)
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** documentation sync is part of DONE — `/spec [mode=sync]` + `/scan --target=integration-tests` + `/docs-update` all run after convergence
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** cite `file:line` evidence for every claim (confidence >80% to act)
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** add a final review todo task to verify work quality

**[TASK-PLANNING]** Before acting, analyze task scope and systematically break it into small todo tasks and sub-tasks using TaskCreate.

> **[IMPORTANT]** Analyze how big the task is and break it into many small todo tasks systematically before starting — this is very important.
