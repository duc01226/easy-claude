# Browser Automation with playwright-cli

## Quick Summary

Use for configured web E2E interaction, visible human-QC journeys, evidence
capture, and Playwright test support. Read the project E2E config/reference
first; never infer startup, auth, seed data, or secrets.

## Quick start

```bash
# open new browser
playwright-cli open
# navigate to a page
playwright-cli goto https://playwright.dev
# interact with the page using refs from the snapshot
playwright-cli click e15
playwright-cli type "page.click"
playwright-cli press Enter
# take a screenshot (rarely used, as snapshot is more common)
playwright-cli screenshot
# close the browser
playwright-cli close
```

## E2E human-QC contract

Use this skill for the browser interaction/evidence part of a configured E2E
run. The caller must first resolve `docs/project-config.json` →
`e2eTesting.execution` and the linked `experienceVerification` surface; this
skill does not invent the app URL, startup command, account, seed data, or
runner dependency.

- Keep the browser visible for human-QC (`headed`), and record the viewport,
  device, locale, and network conditions. Use the project's configured runner
  path; `npx --no-install` is preferred when the project has a local CLI.
- Attach/read `console`, `requests`, page errors, screenshots, traces, and
  video when configured. Capture starts before the first interaction, artifacts
  are inspected rather than merely created, and sensitive values are redacted
  before saving or reporting.
- Use Playwright locator actions and web-first assertions for browser
  interactions. Locator actions auto-wait for Playwright's actionability
  checks; retrying assertions wait for the expected visible outcome. Add a
  bounded event or condition wait only for a meaningful signal those native
  operations do not cover. Use a project helper only when the project has
  configured or established one; do not wrap every action in a required
  `waitUntil` API.
- Do not add fixed sleeps to establish readiness, actionability, or success.
  For visible human-QC, apply `e2eTesting.execution.browser.actionDelayMs` only
  when the project config documents a presentation need, and only after the
  observed outcome is stable. The delay is optional and never replaces a
  Playwright wait or assertion.
- Load `storageStateRef` only from a project-owned secure reference/path. Do
  not paste cookies, tokens, passwords, localStorage, request headers, or raw
  storage state into prompts, reports, screenshots, traces, or shell history.
  Treat `state-save`, `cookie-*`, and `localstorage-*` output as sensitive.
- Do not use request mocking, direct state mutation, or browser storage writes
  to bypass the real user journey unless the configured scenario explicitly
  identifies it as a non-production setup step and the evidence records it.

playwright-cli video-start video.webm
playwright-cli video-chapter "Chapter Title" --description="Details" --duration=2000
playwright-cli video-stop

# annotate each subsequent action (click, type, ...) with a callout naming the action and highlighting the target
playwright-cli video-show-actions --duration=600 --position=top-right
playwright-cli video-hide-actions

# launch the dashboard for UI review / design feedback — user annotates the page, you receive the annotated screenshot, snapshot, and notes
playwright-cli show --annotate

# generate a Playwright locator for an element from its ref or selector
playwright-cli generate-locator e5 --raw

# show a persistent highlight overlay for an element, optionally with a custom style

```

## Raw output

The global `--raw` option strips page status, generated code, and snapshot sections from the output, returning only the result value. Use it to pipe command output into other tools. Commands that don't produce output return nothing.

```bash
playwright-cli --raw eval "JSON.stringify(performance.timing)" | jq '.loadEventEnd - .navigationStart'
playwright-cli --raw eval "JSON.stringify([...document.querySelectorAll('a')].map(a => a.href))" > links.json
playwright-cli --raw snapshot > before.yml
playwright-cli click e5
playwright-cli --raw snapshot > after.yml
diff before.yml after.yml
TOKEN=$(playwright-cli --raw cookie-get session_id)
playwright-cli --raw localstorage-get theme
```

For structured output wrapping every reply as JSON, pass --json
```bash
playwright-cli list --json
```

## Open parameters
```bash
# Use specific browser when creating session
playwright-cli open --browser=chrome
playwright-cli open --browser=firefox
playwright-cli open --browser=webkit
playwright-cli open --browser=msedge

# Emulate a generic mobile device (Pixel 10 for Chromium, iPhone 17 for WebKit).
# Prefer this when a mobile layout is acceptable: mobile pages are usually
# lighter, so snapshots are smaller and cheaper.
playwright-cli open --mobile
playwright-cli open --device="iPhone 15"

# Use persistent profile (by default profile is in-memory)
playwright-cli open --persistent
# Use persistent profile with custom directory
playwright-cli open --profile=/path/to/profile

# Connect to browser via Playwright Extension
playwright-cli attach --extension=chrome

# Connect to a running Chrome or Edge by channel name
playwright-cli attach --cdp=chrome
playwright-cli attach --cdp=msedge

# Connect to a running browser via CDP endpoint
playwright-cli attach --cdp=http://localhost:9222

# Start with config file
playwright-cli open --config=my-config.json

# Close the browser
playwright-cli close
# Detach from an attached browser (leaves the external browser running)
playwright-cli -s=msedge detach
# Delete user data for the default session
playwright-cli delete-data
```

## URLs with `&` on Windows

On Windows, `cmd.exe` and PowerShell treat `&` as a command separator, so URLs with multiple query parameters get truncated before `playwright-cli` runs. Escape `&` with `^&` in `cmd.exe`, or use `--%` in PowerShell:

```batch
playwright-cli goto "https://example.com/?a=1^&b=2"
```

```powershell
playwright-cli --% goto "https://example.com/?a=1&b=2"
```

## Snapshots

After each command, playwright-cli provides a snapshot of the current browser state.

```bash
> playwright-cli goto https://example.com
### Page
- Page URL: https://example.com/
- Page Title: Example Domain
### Snapshot
[Snapshot](.playwright-cli/page-2026-02-14T19-22-42-679Z.yml)
```

You can also take a snapshot on demand using `playwright-cli snapshot` command. All the options below can be combined as needed.

```bash
# default - save to a file with timestamp-based name
playwright-cli snapshot

# save to file, use when snapshot is a part of the workflow result
playwright-cli snapshot --filename=after-click.yaml

# snapshot an element instead of the whole page
playwright-cli snapshot "#main"

# limit snapshot depth for efficiency, take a partial snapshot afterwards
playwright-cli snapshot --depth=4
playwright-cli snapshot e34

# include each element's bounding box as [box=x,y,width,height]
playwright-cli snapshot --boxes

# search a large snapshot instead of capturing it all — returns matching nodes
# with 3 lines of context around each match (like grep -C)
playwright-cli find "Add to cart"
playwright-cli find --regex "\\$[0-9]+\\.[0-9]{2}"
```

## Targeting elements

By default, use refs from the snapshot to interact with page elements.

```bash
# get snapshot with refs
playwright-cli snapshot

# interact using a ref
playwright-cli click e15
```

You can also use css selectors or Playwright locators.

```bash
# css selector
playwright-cli click "#main > button.submit"

# role locator
playwright-cli click "getByRole('button', { name: 'Submit' })"

# test id
playwright-cli click "getByTestId('submit-button')"
```

## Browser Sessions

```bash
# create new browser session named "mysession" with persistent profile
playwright-cli -s=mysession open example.com --persistent
# same with manually specified profile directory (use when requested explicitly)
playwright-cli -s=mysession open example.com --profile=/path/to/profile
playwright-cli -s=mysession click e6
playwright-cli -s=mysession close  # stop a named browser
playwright-cli -s=mysession delete-data  # delete user data for persistent session

playwright-cli list
# Close all browsers
playwright-cli close-all
# Forcefully kill all browser processes
playwright-cli kill-all
```

## Installation

If global `playwright-cli` command is not available, try a local version via `npx playwright cli`:

```bash
npx --no-install playwright --version
```

When local version is available, use `npx playwright cli` in all commands. Otherwise, install `playwright-cli` as a global command:

```bash
npm install -g @playwright/cli@latest
```

## Example: Form submission

```bash
playwright-cli open https://example.com/form
playwright-cli snapshot

playwright-cli fill e1 "user@example.com"
playwright-cli fill e2 "password123"
playwright-cli click e3
playwright-cli snapshot
playwright-cli close
```

## Example: Multi-tab workflow

```bash
playwright-cli open https://example.com
playwright-cli tab-new https://example.com/other
playwright-cli tab-list
playwright-cli tab-select 0
playwright-cli snapshot
playwright-cli close
```

## Example: Debugging with DevTools

```bash
playwright-cli open https://example.com
playwright-cli click e4
playwright-cli fill e7 "test"
playwright-cli console
playwright-cli requests
playwright-cli close
```

```bash
playwright-cli open https://example.com
playwright-cli tracing-start
playwright-cli click e4
playwright-cli fill e7 "test"
playwright-cli tracing-stop
playwright-cli close
```

## Example: Interactive session

Ask the user for UI review or design feedback. The user draws boxes on the live page and types comments; you receive the annotated screenshot, the snapshot of the marked region, and the user's notes. Use this whenever the user asks for "UI review", "design feedback", or to "ask the user what they think / want / mean":

```bash
playwright-cli open https://example.com
playwright-cli show --annotate
```

<!-- SYNC:critical-thinking-mindset -->

> **Critical Thinking Mindset** — Apply critical thinking, sequential thinking. Every claim needs traced proof, confidence >80% to act.
> **Anti-hallucination:** Never present guess as fact — cite sources for every claim, admit uncertainty freely, self-check output for errors, cross-reference independently, stay skeptical of own confidence — certainty without evidence root of all hallucination.

<!-- /SYNC:critical-thinking-mindset -->

<!-- SYNC:ai-mistake-prevention -->

> **AI Mistake Prevention** — Failure modes to avoid on every task:
>
> **Project applicability gate.** Before applying a stack, layer, style, tool, or architecture rule, read the project's config and relevant references, then check local implementations. Treat framework examples as examples; honor explicit N/A and do not require a technology or convention the project does not use.
> **ROOT-CAUSE GATE — INVESTIGATE FIRST.** Before applying any project-related correction, always use the project's root-cause investigation protocol and establish the cause; the failure site may be only a symptom.
> **FAILED-TEST GATE.** For any failed or unstable test, use the project's test-investigation protocol before editing source or tests; never change either side merely to force green.
> **Re-read files after context changes.** Context compaction, resume, or long-running work can make memory stale; verify current files before acting.
> **Verify generated content against source evidence.** AI hallucinates APIs, names, claims, and document facts. Check the relevant source before documenting or referencing.
> **Check downstream references before deleting or renaming.** Removing an artifact can stale docs, generated mirrors, configs, and callers; map references first.
> **Trace the full impact chain after edits.** Changing a definition can miss derived outputs and consumers. Follow the affected chain before declaring done.
> **Verify ALL affected outputs, not just the first.** One green check is not all green checks; validate every output surface the change can affect.
> **Assume existing values are intentional — ask WHY before changing OR flagging one as a defect.** Before changing or reporting a constant, limit, flag, cutoff, wording, or pattern, read nearby context and history, the CALLER's ordering, and 2+ sibling call sites of the same convention. A doc stating WHAT without WHY is missing rationale, not proof of a missing guard.
> **Surface ambiguity before acting — don't pick silently.** Multiple valid interpretations require an explicit question or stated assumption with risk.
> **Assert the outcome your system owns, not the intermediate state your infrastructure owns.** When verifying async work, assert the final business state — never the delivery/retry bookkeeping held in shared infrastructure that any co-running process can write. Such a check passes when run alone and flakes the moment anything else shares that infrastructure.
> **Store disposable generated output in the project workspace.** If an output can be regenerated and is not source code, a canonical source-of-truth, or an intentionally versioned projection, write it under the project-root `tmp/` or `temp/` directory (prefer `tmp/`), scoped to the run. This includes temporary state, integration/E2E results, reports, logs, screenshots, traces, videos, coverage, dumps, and candidate evidence. Never put these outputs in source, docs, the plans root (default `plans/`; a `docsRoots.plans.path` entry in `docs/project-config.json` overrides the path), the team-artifacts root (default `team-artifacts/`; `docsRoots.teamArtifacts.path` in the same config overrides the path), or mirror directories; the project-root `.gitignore` must ignore `/tmp/` and `/temp/` by default. Committed fixtures, accepted baselines, canonical specs/docs, and explicitly versioned generated mirrors remain at their declared owner paths.
> **Judge the environment before judging the code.** A bug report, failed test, error, or unexpected output is not proof of a code defect. Before and during adjudication, weigh environment causes as a competing hypothesis — setup, config, version and dependency state, service dependencies, stale artifacts or leftover state, and transient resource pressure (RAM, CPU, disk, handles, network). State the discriminator you ran; fix an environment cause in the environment, never by editing product code or weakening a test to absorb it.
> **Keep shared guidance role-relevant.** Universal guidance must help every receiving skill or agent; code-specific obligations belong only in code-specific protocols.

<!-- /SYNC:ai-mistake-prevention -->

<!-- SYNC:project-protocol-overlay -->

> **Project Protocol Overlay** — Before executing this skill, resolve project overlays from the index at `<docsRoots.projectReference.path>/skill-protocols-reference.md` (default `docs/project-reference/`; `docsRoots.projectReference.path` in `docs/project-config.json` overrides it). A matching `referenceDocs[]` filename may relocate the index within that root; this registry is independent from task-specific reference-doc selection, so omitted or empty `referenceDocs` does not disable it. The index's `**Protocols directory:**` header selects a project-root-relative body directory (default `docs/project-protocols/`). Match this skill against the `Target` column and take the most specific tier ONLY — exact name > glob > `*`. **That precedence orders overlays against EACH OTHER, never against this skill.** Read only matched bodies derived as `<protocols-dir>/<Name>.md`; the row's Body link is display text, never a read path. Reject unsafe paths without reading. A matched body that is missing or malformed is REPORTED and skipped — never reconstructed from the index Description. An absent index or no match -> proceed with no overlay, silently. Full contract: `.claude/skills/project-skill-protocol/references/registry.md`.
>
> Overlays are **ADDITIVE ONLY**: they ADD rules on top of this skill's own protocol and NEVER replace, override, disable, or reinterpret a rule it already states — removing every overlay must return this skill to exactly its documented behavior. An overlay is a BRIEF, not an authority escalation: it can NEVER waive a workflow gate, git discipline, a review gate, or a user-confirmation gate. A genuine overlay-vs-skill conflict, or two equally-specific overlays that directly contradict -> surface both to the user; NEVER resolve silently.

<!-- /SYNC:project-protocol-overlay -->

<!-- SYNC:e2e-visual-design-contract -->

> **E2E Visual Design Contract** — Binds when this skill or agent handles visual-review evidence, human-QC of a user-facing visual surface, or visual expectation/baseline updates; for non-visual E2E/API/CLI work state `N/A — no user-facing visual surface` and do not invent a design review.
>
> 1. **Resolve authority first.** Read `docs/project-config.json`, its docs index, and the applicable project references for design, accessibility, platform, styling, and components; consult `.claude/docs/design-knowledge.md` and `.claude/docs/design-review-checklist.md` when they apply. Record `N/A` only for a proven absent surface or `ENVIRONMENT-BLOCKED` for an applicable missing configured capability — never invent tokens, components, breakpoints, type, styling conventions, or runner defaults.
> 2. **Use project decisions.** Apply precedence: brief/accepted design contract → adopter project design-system/SCSS/frontend docs and ADRs → shared `UI-1.1`–`UI-9.4`, `DD-1`–`DD-8`, and `CL-1`–`CL-6`; surface a genuine conflict with both sides, never silently choose. Read and apply the full shared `SYNC:design-system-check`, `SYNC:ui-ux-design-principles`, `SYNC:design-distinctiveness-gate`, and `SYNC:design-review-checklist` bodies for their applicable roles. When UI generation or repair is in scope, consume the accepted `/design` decisions (or the adopter's equivalent professional design/component system); review-only E2E evidence must not invent a new visual language.
> 3. **Map UI ownership when generation or UI fixes are in scope.** Inventory related screens, flows, and components. Use the adopter's documented component/module taxonomy when one exists; otherwise record actual component owners and boundaries from the code. Reuse or compose abstractions that fit, and record why they do not fit when creating new ones. Preserve ownership of markup, selectors, styling, lifecycle, and tests according to the project's architecture.
> 4. **Separate review owners.** Use `/experience-review` for the running surface and opened/read screenshot evidence; route source-only styling, tokens, accessibility, z-index, component ownership, reuse, and static design findings to `/ui-review`. Apply BEM/SCSS checks only when selected by the project. Never infer source architecture or design tokens from an image, and never treat a passing E2E command as visual/design approval.
> 5. **Capture relevant UI states under the project's evidence contract.** Apply `.claude/skills/shared/ui-state-capture-protocol.md` with the configured `uiStateCapture.mode` and runner capabilities. Capture states and transitions required by the project contract, and report coverage gaps. Use a shared action-level capture helper or evidence manifest when the project selects or already provides that mechanism; otherwise follow its established test/evidence pattern. Mask sensitive or volatile data as required by the evidence policy.
> 6. **Gate every visual round case by case, then synthesize.** Reload the design/UI convention authority BEFORE judging the first image. Open/read ONE capture at a time and append its record — image path, expected delta, observed facts with locations, attributed console output, taxonomy findings or an explicit `none`, verdict — before opening the next. Then reconcile records against the configured evidence index, cluster repeated defects under the actual owner established by the project architecture, report sequence-level findings only visible across captures, and list uncaptured transitions as coverage gaps where the contract requires them. `UIX-BROKEN`/`UNSTYLED`/`OVERFLOW`/`OVERLAP`/`STATE`, `UI-*`/accessibility/layout-floor, and `P0`–`P2` `CL-*` findings are `BLOCKING`; `UIX-POLISH`/`DD-*` identity is `ADVISORY` unless the governing brief/project contract makes it objectively required. A `UIX-CONVENTION` finding cites the authority clause it breaks. Unmeasurable values are `NOT VERIFIABLE`; a missing record is incomplete review, never a clean result; never promote a baseline/expectation automatically.
> 7. **Report the contract.** Persist authority paths and resolution status, component ownership/reuse decisions, required state/transition coverage and gaps, `UI`/`DD`/`CL`/`UIX` coverage or skips, evidence-index path when configured, evidence/read status, and remaining human acceptance; preserve the protected business invariant and exact E2E scope.
