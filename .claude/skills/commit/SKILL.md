## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Stage changes and create well-structured git commits following Conventional Commits format — and, when code changed, gate the commit on a user-confirmed `integration-test-verify` run (default No → verify first).

**Workflow:**

1. **Analyze Changes** — Run git status/diff to understand staged and unstaged changes
2. **Stage Changes** — Add relevant files (specific or all)
3. **Identify Reviewers** — from git history, list relevant reviewers (last author per touched file vs `HEAD`, excluding the commit author) and the area each must focus on — computed BEFORE the commit so the block can be embedded in the message body
4. **Generate Message** — Detect type (feat/fix/refactor/etc.), extract scope from paths, write subject, add a detailed body structured as **purpose/kind → what changed → how it works**, and append the **Reviewers** block from step 3
5. **Test-Verify Gate** — When staged changes include code that might need tests, confirm with the user (`AskUserQuestion`, default **No**) whether they ran `integration-test-verify`. Default = run verify first; only **Yes** lets the commit proceed
6. **Commit** — Create commit with HEREDOC (title + detailed summary + Reviewers block + attribution footer)
7. **Verify** — Confirm with git status and git log

**Key Rules:**

- Write a detailed body — **purpose/kind → what changed → how it works** — so the next human reading `git log`/`git blame` understands the change without opening the diff. As detailed as the change needs (wrap ~72 chars); no title-only commits for non-trivial changes
- Embed a **Reviewers** block in the commit message — the per-area reviewers (last author per touched file vs `HEAD`, commit author excluded) — computed BEFORE committing so it lives in the message body, not just as a side report
- When staged changes include code that might need tests, **gate the commit on test verification** — ask the user whether `integration-test-verify` was run (default **No → run verify first**); only an explicit **Yes** proceeds straight to commit
- Stop after the commit; push only when the user explicitly requests it (or passes `--push` / says "commit and push" → stage + commit + push via `git-manager`)
- Never commit secrets, credentials, or .env files
- Never use `--amend` or `--no-verify` unless explicitly requested
- Include `Generated with [Claude Code]` attribution footer

**Be skeptical. Apply critical thinking, sequential thinking. Every claim needs traced proof, confidence percentages (Idea should be more than 80%).**

# Git Commit Skill

Stage changes and create well-structured git commits following Conventional Commits format.

## IMPORTANT: Bypass git-commit-block Hook

Before running any `git add` or `git commit` commands, create the marker file to bypass the `git-commit-block` hook:

```bash
PROJ=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel) && mkdir -p "$PROJ/tmp/claude-temp" && touch "$PROJ/tmp/claude-temp/.commit-skill-active"
```

After committing (success or failure), **always** clean up the marker:

```bash
rm -f "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/tmp/claude-temp/.commit-skill-active"
```

## Workflow

### Step 1: Analyze Changes

```bash
# Check current status (never use -uall flag)
git status

# See staged changes
git diff --cached

# See unstaged changes
git diff

# Check recent commit style
git log --oneline -5
```

### Step 2: Stage Changes

```bash
# Stage all changes
git add .

# Or stage specific files
git add <file-path>
```

### Step 2.5: Docs-Update Triage

Before committing, check if staged files impact documentation:

1. Run `git diff --name-only --cached` to list staged files
2. Check if any staged file matches doc-impact patterns (resolve the concrete backend/frontend source paths from the project's structure reference / `docs/project-config.json`):
    - changes under the backend service source paths (per project config) → may impact `docs/specs/`
    - `.claude/skills/**` → may impact `.claude/docs/skills/`
    - `.claude/hooks/**` → may impact `.claude/docs/hooks/`
    - `.claude/workflows.json` → may impact `CLAUDE.md` workflow table
    - changes under the frontend app source paths (per project config) → may impact frontend pattern docs
3. If matches found: invoke `/docs-update` skill, then re-stage any doc changes with `git add`
4. If no matches: skip (log "No doc-impacting files staged")

### Step 2.7: Identify Reviewers (pre-commit — feeds the message)

Runs **BEFORE** the commit so the result can be embedded in the commit message body (see Step 3). Read-only (git log/blame only) — it NEVER blocks the commit and never messages anyone.

For each **staged** file, find the **LAST author who touched it** (against `HEAD`, the soon-to-be parent) — that author is the natural reviewer for the area.

Rules:

- **EXCLUDE the commit author** from the "ask to review" list (you don't ask yourself to review) — but still surface files where the author is the only prior toucher as **author-owned, no external reviewer**.
- **Brand-new files (no prior history)** → mark `NEW FILE — reviewer = owner of its source/sibling file`.
- **GROUP reviewers by change AREA** (which feature/subsystem each owns) and state WHICH AREA each must focus on — not a flat name list.
- Fetch each reviewer's email for tagging.

Collect the raw last-author-per-staged-file data:

```bash
# Staged files in this pending commit
git diff --cached --name-only \
  | while read -r f; do
      author=$(git log -1 --format='%an' HEAD -- "$f" 2>/dev/null)
      email=$(git log -1 --format='%ae' HEAD -- "$f" 2>/dev/null)
      date=$(git log -1 --format='%ad' --date=short HEAD -- "$f" 2>/dev/null)
      [ -z "$author" ] && author="(NEW FILE — reviewer = source/sibling owner)" && date="-"
      printf '%s\t%s\t%s\t%s\n' "$author" "$email" "$date" "$f"
    done
```

Then: collapse by author, map each author's files to the change area, drop the commit author, and render the **Reviewers** block to embed in the commit message (Step 3) and to present to the user:

| Reviewer | Email | Focus area | Files |
| -------- | ----- | ---------- | ----- |

Follow the table with a short **recommended review assignment by feature** list (area → reviewer). The skill does NOT auto-message anyone — this is the user's deliverable.

### Step 3: Generate Commit Message

Analyze staged changes and generate message following **Conventional Commits**:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<detailed summary of changes>

Reviewers:
- <area>: <Reviewer Name> <email> — focus on <what they own>
```

#### Type Detection

| Change Pattern          | Type       |
| ----------------------- | ---------- |
| New file/feature        | `feat`     |
| Bug fix, error handling | `fix`      |
| Code restructure        | `refactor` |
| Documentation only      | `docs`     |
| Tests only              | `test`     |
| Dependencies, config    | `chore`    |
| Performance improvement | `perf`     |
| Formatting only         | `style`    |

#### Scope Rules

Extract from file paths:

- `{configured-source-root}/auth/` → `auth`
- `.claude/skills/` → `claude-skills`
- `libs/{shared-lib}/` → `{shared-lib}`
- Multiple unrelated areas → omit scope

#### Subject Rules

- Imperative mood ("add" not "added")
- Lowercase start
- No period at end
- Max 50 characters

#### Body Rules (MANDATORY) — write so a human understands fastest

> Body is the deliverable. Optimize for the next person running `git log` / `git blame` — they understand the change **without opening the diff**. As detailed as the change needs; no artificial brevity limit — wrap ~72 chars, stop once nothing new said. Title-only commit FORBIDDEN for any non-trivial change. — why: the diff shows WHAT; the body must carry WHY + HOW, which the diff cannot.

Structure body in three parts (omit a part only when genuinely empty):

1. **Purpose / kind** — Name **what kind of change and why it exists**: feature, bug fix (state symptom removed), enhancement, refactor (state behaviour-preserving), perf, security, chore. 1–2 sentences answering _"what problem does this solve?"_.
2. **What changed** — Concrete edits grouped by **behaviour** (not by file). Each bullet specific to behaviour/files touched — NEVER vague lines ("update code", "fix stuff", "minor fixes").
3. **How it works / why this way** — The part reviewers need. Explain **mechanism, key logic, invariants relied on, edge cases preserved**, and any non-obvious decision ("did X instead of obvious Y because Z"). Focus **non-obvious** — never narrate boilerplate. Ordering/timing/security-review invariant or subtle failure mode → call out explicitly.

> **Teach-the-reader mindset (from the `understand` skill):** cover BOTH high-level motivation (why it matters) AND low-level logic (business rules, edge cases). Surface what a reader would NOT guess from the diff — write the explanation you would want to receive.

**Detail dial — scale body to the change:**

| Change size                          | Body depth                                                                              |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Trivial (typo, rename, formatting)   | Purpose line + 1 bullet; skip "how it works"                                             |
| Normal (feature/fix, single area)    | Purpose + 2–5 "what" bullets + a short "how it works"                                    |
| Complex (cross-cutting, subtle bug)  | Purpose + grouped "what" + a full "how it works" that spells out the key invariant / edge case / why-this-over-that |

### Step 3.5: Test-Verify Gate (blocking — only when code changed)

Before committing, decide whether the staged changes carry **code that might need tests**. This gate protects against committing untested behaviour changes.

**Trigger detection** — run `git diff --cached --name-only` and classify the staged files:

- **Code that might need tests** → any change to production/source code: backend service source, frontend app source, shared libraries, scripts, hooks (`.cjs`), or other executable logic (resolve concrete source roots from `docs/project-config.json` / the project structure reference).
- **NOT a trigger (skip the gate)** → the staged set is _only_ docs (`docs/**`, `*.md`), specs (`docs/specs/**`), test-spec/config text, changelog, or other non-executable content with no source-code change.

**If the gate is NOT triggered:** log `Test-Verify Gate: skipped (no code changes staged)` and continue to Step 4.

**If the gate IS triggered:** STOP and ask the user with `AskUserQuestion` (default option is **No**):

> Header: `Test verify`
> Question: `Staged code changes may need tests. Did you run integration-test-verify and did it pass?`
> Options (in order — first is the default):
> 1. `No — run verify before commit` (Recommended) — do NOT commit yet; invoke the `integration-test-verify` skill, let it run, and only proceed to Step 4 if it passes. If it fails, surface the failures and stop (no commit).
> 2. `Yes — already verified` — the user confirms integration tests were run and passed; proceed directly to Step 4 (Commit).

Rules:

- **Default is No.** If the user does not actively choose "Yes", treat it as No and run verification first — never commit unverified code on assumption.
- **Yes is an explicit user assertion** that `integration-test-verify` was run and passed; honour it and commit.
- Re-run this gate only once per commit; after a `No → verify passes`, proceed to commit without re-asking.
- This gate is independent of `--push`: it runs before the commit in every mode.

### Step 4: Commit

Use HEREDOC for proper formatting:

```bash
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
type(scope): subject

- summarize key change 1 with intent
- summarize key change 2 with impact

Reviewers:
- <area>: Reviewer Name <reviewer@email> — focus on <what they own>

Generated by AI
EOF
)"
```

> The **Reviewers** block comes from Step 2.7 (last author per staged file vs `HEAD`, commit author excluded, grouped by area). Omit the block only when every staged file is brand-new or author-owned with no external reviewer — in that case state `Reviewers: none (author-owned / new files)`.

### Step 5: Verify

```bash
git status
git log -1
```

Confirm the committed message body contains the **Reviewers** block from Step 2.7 (or the explicit `Reviewers: none (author-owned / new files)` line). Re-present the per-area reviewer assignment to the user as the final deliverable so they can request the right reviewers on the resulting PR.

## Examples

```
feat(order): add warehouse filter to list

- add warehouse query parameter in order list endpoint
- wire frontend filter control to request payload
- update tests for filtered and unfiltered list behavior

Reviewers:
- order backend: Jane Doe <jane@acme.com> — focus on the list endpoint query change
- order UI: Bob Lee <bob@acme.com> — focus on the filter control wiring

Generated by AI

fix(validation): handle empty date range

- guard null/empty date inputs before parsing
- return validation message instead of throwing format exception

Reviewers: none (author-owned / new files)

```

## Critical Rules

- **ALWAYS stage all unstaged changes** before committing — run `git add .` (or specific files) so nothing is left behind
- **Test-Verify Gate (Step 3.5):** when staged changes include code that might need tests, ask the user whether `integration-test-verify` was run — **default No → run verify before committing**; only an explicit **Yes** commits without first running verify. Skip the gate only when the staged set is docs/specs/config with no source-code change
- **Stop after the commit; push** to remote only when the user explicitly requests it
- **Review staged changes** before committing
- **Never commit** secrets, credentials, or .env files
- **Never use** `git commit --amend` unless explicitly requested AND the commit was created in this session AND not yet pushed
- **Never skip** hooks with `--no-verify` unless explicitly requested
- Commit message MUST include a Conventional Commit title AND a detailed body — **purpose/kind → what changed → how it works**. As detailed as the change needs (wrap ~72 chars); title-only commit FORBIDDEN for non-trivial changes
- Optimize body for the next human reading `git log` / `git blame` — surface the non-obvious (key logic, invariants, edge cases, why-this-over-that), not just a list of touched files
- Include attribution footer: `Generated by AI`
- **Embed reviewers in the commit message** — BEFORE committing (Step 2.7), surface the last author per staged file vs `HEAD` (exclude the commit author), grouped by focus area, and write it as a `Reviewers:` block in the message body so the right reviewers travel with the commit/PR. Read-only; never blocks the commit.

## Push & PR Operations

**Arg `--push` (a.k.a. "commit and push"):** stage all changes + create the commit + push to remote in one shot — spawn `git-manager` immediately after committing to push. This is the former standalone stage-commit-push entry point folded into `commit`; it adds no logic beyond the push delegation already described below.

This skill handles **commit** by default. Push-to-remote and pull request creation are delegated to `git-manager` sub-agent (`subagent_type: "git-manager"`).

`git-manager` handles:

- Conventional commit message validation enforcement
- `--no-verify` bypass prevention
- PR creation with structured summaries

Spawn `git-manager` after committing when user says "push", "create PR", or "open PR".

## Sub-Agent Type Override

> **MANDATORY:** Push and PR operations spawn `git-manager` sub-agent (`subagent_type: "git-manager"`), NOT the main agent.
> **Rationale:** `git-manager` enforces conventional commits, prevents hook bypasses, and handles PR creation with structured summaries.

- **Sub-Agent Selection:** route specialized domains to the matching specialist; NEVER `code-reviewer`.

- **Critical Thinking:** traced `file:line` proof per claim; confidence >80% to act, never guess.

- **MANDATORY MUST ATTENTION — AI KEEPS FORGETTING:** code changed? `AskUserQuestion` whether `integration-test-verify` ran BEFORE committing — default **No → verify first**, only **Yes** commits — why: prevents committing unverified code
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** break work into small todo tasks using `TaskCreate` BEFORE starting
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** search codebase for 3+ similar patterns before creating new code
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** cite `file:line` evidence for every claim (confidence >80% to act)
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** add a final review todo task to verify work quality

| "It's a small change, skip the verify question"  | Size doesn't decide — any code that might need tests triggers the gate. Skip only docs/specs/config-only diffs. |
| "Asking is annoying, I'll just proceed"          | The confirmation is the point — AI keeps committing unverified code. Ask every time code changed.        |

**[TASK-PLANNING]** Before acting, analyze task scope and systematically break it into small todo tasks and sub-tasks using TaskCreate.
