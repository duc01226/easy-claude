## Quick Summary

**Goal:** As solution architect, deliver a complete, evidence-backed, user-validated architecture decision report covering ALL concerns (backend, frontend, design patterns, library ecosystem, testing, CI/CD, deployment, monitoring, code quality, dependency management) — every concern researched with 3+ options, every recommendation carrying confidence % + cited evidence, every decision user-confirmed — so implementation proceeds on sound, owned architectural choices.

**Summary:**

- Decide mode FIRST (Step 1): greenfield researches every concern from scratch; brownfield reads reference docs + accepted ADRs, constrains research to existing stack — NEVER re-litigate a settled ADR-recorded decision without superseding-ADR rationale.
- **Rank every decision by REVERSIBILITY first (Step 2): one-way door (data model, tenancy, consistency model, service boundaries, public contracts, sync-vs-async) → ADR + user validation MANDATORY; two-way door → decide and move.** — why: architecture IS the set of decisions expensive to reverse; treating a one-way door as reversible is the costliest error this skill can make.
- Drive style choice with NUMBERS, not adjectives: quantify Step-2 quality-attribute scenarios (latency p95/p99, throughput, SLO, RPO/RTO, data growth, concurrency); pick **≤3 DRIVING attributes and name which ones you SACRIFICE**; any unknown target becomes explicit `Unresolved question`, never a silent guess.
- **Profile the workload before selecting a scaling technique:** read/write ratio · sustained/peak RPS · query shapes · data size/growth · burstiness/hot keys · consistency/staleness · user geography. Escalate through the smallest reversible rung: measure/tune → choose vertical and/or stateless horizontal scale from headroom + availability needs → read/write-specific tactics → partition/shard LAST. — why: a scalable product is a sequence of evidenced bottleneck removals, not a shopping list of distributed components.
- **Simplicity is the default; complexity must be BOUGHT with a measured requirement — modulith-first, distribute only against a named + measured extraction trigger (Step 3A).** Reason FROM `.claude/docs/architecture-knowledge.md` (laws, coupling taxonomy, style triggers, trade-off + anti-pattern catalogs) — never from familiarity or fashion.
- Every concern needs 3+ researched options with cited evidence (stars, last release, downloads, CVE scan) + confidence % — familiarity alone never sufficient grounds for a recommendation.
- **Interrogate before deciding, DESIGN IT TWICE, then self-audit:** run the 15-question pre-decision script (§20.1) on every one-way door (Step 2-2) · produce ≥2 MATERIALLY different candidates per one-way door before choosing (Step 3A) · run the 11 thinking red flags (§20.3) against your own draft before emitting. Prescribe the **TACTIC** (§2), never the product. — why: a first-idea design with no rejected alternative and no named falsifier is a belief, not a decision.
- Produce the two binding downstream contracts or the chain breaks: emit an ADR per hard-to-reverse decision (`architecture-review` Cat 9 enforces) and the Scaffold Handoff tool-choices table (`scaffold`/`harness-setup` consume), then run the MANDATORY Step-12 user-validation interview before confirming.
- **Main steps/tasks (run in order, track each):** 1 Load Context (+pick greenfield/brownfield mode) → 2 Derive Architecture Requirements (+workload profile/scaling ladder, reversibility ranking, ≤3 driving attributes, 6-part quality-attribute scenarios, 2-2 pre-decision interrogation, user-validate) → 3A Backend Styles (selection procedure incl. DESIGN IT TWICE + extraction triggers) → 3B Backend Design Patterns → **3C Data & Consistency Architecture** (store/substrate per access pattern, replication/failover, cache contract, consistency + staleness, transaction boundary, tenancy, partitioning, migrations, retention) → **3D Integration & API Architecture** (sync-vs-async + acceptance state, API/edge cache style, versioning, contract tests, outbox, idempotency, event granularity) → 4 Frontend Architecture (styles + patterns) → 4B UI System Architecture (styling/tokens/components/responsive, user-validate; skip if backend-only) → 5 Library Ecosystem Research (3 options/concern) → 6 Testing Architecture → 7 CI/CD & Deployment (+expand–contract migrations, backward AND forward compat) → 8 Observability & Monitoring (signal roles + sampling/cardinality) → 9 Code Quality + Scaffold Handoff table → 10 Dependency Risk Assessment → 11 Generate Report + emit ADRs → 12 User Validation Interview (8-12 questions, mark `confirmed`) → Next Steps + always-offer council escalation. — why: AI keeps forgetting the skill's own steps; this is the recovery anchor.

**Workflow (12 steps):**

1. **Load Context** — Read domain model, tech stack, business evaluation, refined PBI
2. **Derive Architecture Requirements** — Profile workload + ordered scaling ladder, rank reversibility, pick ≤3 driving attributes, quantify 6-part scenarios, run 2-2 pre-decision interrogation on every one-way door
3. **Backend Architecture** — 3A styles (selection procedure) · 3B design patterns · **3C data & consistency** · **3D integration & APIs**
4. **Frontend Architecture** — Research top 3 frontend architecture styles + design patterns
5. **Library Ecosystem Research** — Best-practice libraries per concern (validation, caching, logging, utils, etc.)
6. **Testing Architecture** — Unit, integration, E2E, performance testing frameworks + strategy
7. **CI/CD & Deployment** — Pipeline design, containerization, orchestration, IaC
8. **Observability & Monitoring** — Logging, metrics, tracing, alerting stack
9. **Code Quality & Clean Code** — Linters, analyzers, formatters, enforcement tooling
10. **Dependency Risk Assessment** — Package health, obsolescence risk, maintenance cost
11. **Generate Report** — Full architecture decision report with all recommendations
12. **User Validation** — Present findings, ask 8-12 questions, confirm all decisions

**Key Rules:**

- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** research minimum 3 options per architecture concern with web evidence
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** include confidence % with evidence for every recommendation
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** run user validation interview at end (never skip)
- Delegate to `solution-architect` agent for complex architecture decisions
- All claims must cite sources (URL, benchmark, case study, or codebase evidence)
- Base every recommendation on evidence, never on familiarity alone

**Be skeptical. Apply critical thinking, sequential thinking. Every claim needs traced proof, confidence percentages (Idea should be more than 80%).**

## Inputs & Handoffs (consume vs produce)

Skill sits mid-workflow — consumes settled upstream decisions, produces artifacts downstream steps build on. Do NOT re-derive what upstream step already owns; do NOT leave downstream consumer without its needed artifact. — why: re-deriving settled decisions wastes effort and risks divergence from the recorded choice.

| Consumes (read, don't re-derive)                 | From                  | Produces (named deliverable)                                  | Consumed by                         |
| ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Bounded contexts, aggregates, domain events, ERD | `domain-analysis`     | Architecture decision report (`{plan-dir}/research/...`)      | `plan`, `plan-execute`              |
| Confirmed languages/frameworks/databases         | `tech-stack-research` | Confirmed decisions (`{plan-dir}/phase-02b-architecture.md`)  | `plan`, `scaffold`                  |
| Expected scale, compliance, budget constraints   | `business-evaluation` | Scaffold Handoff table (tooling + fitness rules)             | `scaffold`, `harness-setup`         |
| Existing stack/patterns/ADRs (brownfield)        | reference docs, `docs/adr/**` | ADRs for hard-to-reverse decisions (`docs/adr/`)     | `architecture-review` (conformance) |

If upstream artifact missing, capture minimum needed here and note gap — NEVER silently re-run full upstream analysis. — why: a silent re-run hides the missing-input gap that the owning step should resolve.

---

## Step 1: Load Context

> **Mode (decide first):** **Greenfield** (new project, e.g. via `workflow-greenfield-init`) → research every concern from scratch, full 3-options-per-concern. **Brownfield** (large feature in existing codebase, e.g. `workflow-big-feature`) → FIRST read project reference docs + accepted ADRs, constrain research to existing stack/patterns, propose changes only where new requirement genuinely outgrows them — NEVER re-litigate settled ADR-recorded decision without superseding-ADR rationale. — why: re-deciding a recorded choice churns the codebase and breaks downstream conformance checks.

Read artifacts from prior workflow steps (search `plans/` and `team-artifacts/`):

- Domain model / ERD (complexity, bounded contexts, aggregate count)
- Tech stack decisions (confirmed languages, frameworks, databases)
- Business evaluation (scale, constraints, compliance)
- Refined PBI (scope, acceptance criteria)
- Discovery interview (team skills, experience level)

Extract, summarize:

| Signal                  | Value        | Source           |
| ----------------------- | ------------ | ---------------- |
| Bounded contexts        | ...          | domain model     |
| Aggregate count         | ...          | domain model     |
| Cross-context events    | ...          | domain model     |
| Confirmed tech stack    | ...          | tech stack phase |
| Expected scale          | ...          | business eval    |
| Team architecture exp.  | ...          | discovery        |
| Compliance requirements | ...          | business eval    |
| Real-time needs         | Yes/No       | refined PBI      |
| Integration complexity  | Low/Med/High | domain model     |
| Deployment target       | ...          | business eval    |

---

## Step 2: Derive Architecture Requirements

> **Reason FROM the knowledge body, not from memory.** `.claude/docs/architecture-knowledge.md` is AUTHORITATIVE for architecture laws (CAP/PACELC, Conway, Amdahl, USL, Little, Gall, Hyrum, Parnas), the coupling taxonomy + four coupling dimensions, style-selection triggers, the trade-off cheat sheet, and the ~100-entry anti-pattern catalog. Read the sections relevant to this design before recommending. **Honor the catalog's provenance markers in §3/§8/§9/§10** — a row (or section banner) marked `— VERIFY` is an UNVERIFIED assertion, so cite it as a hypothesis to check against the named source **where one is named** (a `[model-knowledge]` row names none — check the project's own docs or a primary source instead), NEVER as settled fact in a recommendation. **The project's own reference docs and accepted ADRs OUTRANK that catalog on any conflict** — the catalog supplies universal reasoning, the project supplies binding convention. — why: universal names hardcoded as project rules rot against real repos.

### 2-0: Rank every decision by REVERSIBILITY (do this FIRST)

Architecture = the set of decisions **expensive to reverse**; everything cheap to reverse is design — leave it to implementers. Classify each decision BEFORE researching it, because the classification sets how much rigour it earns.

| Class | Meaning | Required treatment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **One-way door** | Reversal costs a migration, a rewrite, or a breaking change to consumers | **ADR (Step 11) + user validation (Step 12) MANDATORY** — research 3+ options, name the rejected alternative AND the measurable revisit trigger |
| **Two-way door** | Reversal is a refactor inside one module | Decide, record one line, move on — NEVER burn a validation question on it |

**One-way doors (assume MANDATORY ADR unless proven otherwise):** data model + primary-key strategy · tenancy model · consistency model per read path · sync-vs-async at a boundary · public API/event contract · service boundary lines · cloud-primitive lock-in · auth/identity model · data residency + retention.

**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** never treat a one-way door as a two-way door to save a step — why: an unreviewed irreversible decision is the single most expensive failure mode of this skill, and it surfaces months later as a migration.

Map signals to architecture constraints:

| Signal                      | Architecture Requirement                                  | Priority |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| Many bounded contexts       | Clear module boundaries, context isolation                | Must     |
| High scale                  | Horizontal scaling, stateless services, caching strategy  | Must     |
| Complex domain              | Rich domain model, separation of domain from infra        | Must     |
| Cross-context events        | Event-driven communication, eventual consistency          | Must     |
| Small team                  | Low ceremony, fewer layers, convention over configuration | Should   |
| Compliance                  | Audit trail, immutable events, access control layers      | Must     |
| Real-time                   | Event sourcing or pub/sub, WebSocket/SSE support          | Should   |
| High integration complexity | Anti-corruption layers, adapter pattern, API gateway      | Should   |

### Quality-Attribute Scenarios (quantify — these drive the style choice)

Qualitative "Must/Should" cannot decide, e.g., modular monolith vs microservices. Capture **measurable** targets; ask user for any unknown via `AskUserQuestion` (guess acceptable only when labelled an assumption with confidence %). These targets become ADR-recorded budgets `architecture-review` Category 9 later checks changes against. — why: a style chosen without numbers is a guess, not an enforceable decision.

| Quality attribute     | Scenario (stimulus → measurable response)                             | Target (fill in) |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Latency               | p95 / p99 response time for the hottest read and write paths         | e.g. p99 < 300ms |
| Throughput            | Sustained req/s and peak burst the system must absorb                | e.g. 500 rps peak |
| Availability / SLO    | Target uptime and error budget                                       | e.g. 99.9%       |
| Data durability (RPO) | Max acceptable data loss on failure                                  | e.g. ≤ 5 min     |
| Recovery (RTO)        | Max acceptable time to restore service                               | e.g. ≤ 30 min    |
| Data-volume growth    | Row/document/event growth → storage, index, partition strategy       | e.g. 10M rows/yr |
| Concurrency           | Concurrent users/sessions and contention hot spots                   | e.g. 2k concurrent |
| Compliance/retention  | Regulated data, retention window, residency, audit                   | e.g. GDPR, 7yr   |
| Cost unit economics   | `$/request`, `$/tenant`, `$/MAU` — and whether unit cost RISES with scale | e.g. <$0.002/req |

Scenario template — **all SIX parts, none optional**: `[SOURCE: who/what triggers] [STIMULUS: the event] on [ARTIFACT: which component] under [ENVIRONMENT: the conditions] SHALL produce [RESPONSE] within [MEASURE: threshold + instrument]`. "Must be scalable" decides nothing; "5,000 concurrent checkout sessions at 400 rps SHALL complete p99 < 800 ms, ≤0.1% errors, verified by the CI k6 profile" selects a structure.

**MUST ATTENTION** a scenario missing SOURCE or ARTIFACT is untestable — you cannot write a fitness function for "the system" under "load", so name the actor and the component. — why: an unattributed scenario gets no owner, no test and no budget, so it is never verified and silently degrades.

**Rule:** any target left unknown is explicit `Unresolved question` (Step 11), NEVER a silent omission — an architecture chosen without scale numbers is a guess, not a decision.

### Workload Profile + Scaling Ladder (MANDATORY before technique selection)

Record `read:write ratio` · sustained/peak RPS or events/s · dominant query/write shapes · dataset size + growth · payload size · burst duration · hot-key/tenant skew · user regions · latency percentile targets · consistency/staleness tolerance. For every proposed scaling component, name the measured bottleneck it removes and the next bottleneck it creates.

| Order | Use when evidence shows | First tactic | Purchase price |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1. Measure + tune | Baseline unknown or slow path unprofiled | Query/plan analysis, indexes, batching, pooling, compression | Engineering time; lowest reversibility cost |
| 2A. Vertical scale | One node remains simplest and headroom exists | More CPU/RAM/IOPS; tune runtime/database | Hardware ceiling; remaining SPOF without redundancy |
| 2B. Horizontal app scale | Availability or aggregate compute requires replicas and the path can be stateless | Replicas + redundant load balancing + health checks | Coordination, externalized state, deployment complexity |
| 4. Read-path scale | High read ratio or global read latency | Cache/CDN/read replicas/read models | Invalidation, lag, read-your-writes, cache-key correctness |
| 5. Write-path scale | Bursty ingest or heavy work need not finish inline | Batching, durable queue + workers; LSM store for sustained write-heavy known-query workloads | Accepted ≠ completed, retries/idempotency/backpressure; compaction/read amplification |
| 6. Partition/shard | Earlier rungs proven insufficient by capacity measurements | Query-aligned partition key + reshard plan | Cross-shard queries/transactions, hotspots, hard reversal |

**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** NEVER jump to sharding, multi-region writes, or an extra datastore without evidence that earlier rungs cannot meet the quantified target — why: these are hard-to-reverse operational systems, not generic performance upgrades.

**Move each attribute with a TACTIC, not a product.** Once a target is unmet or at risk, select the mechanism from the tactics inventory in `.claude/docs/architecture-knowledge.md` §2 (availability · performance · modifiability · security · testability · usability) — "bulkhead a pool per dependency" is a design decision; "add Kubernetes" is a shopping list. — why: the tactic is portable across stacks and makes the trade-off legible, the product imports costs nobody asked for.

### 2-1: Pick ≤3 DRIVING attributes — and name what you SACRIFICE

Quality attributes CONFLICT, and that conflict IS the architecture: consistency↔availability · latency↔durability · flexibility↔simplicity · security↔usability · cost↔redundancy · performance↔modifiability.

**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** name at most 3 DRIVING attributes and explicitly record which attributes are being SACRIFICED to buy them — a design claiming to maximize everything has decided nothing — why: unnamed sacrifices resurface as production surprises nobody agreed to.

| Field | Record |
| --- | --- |
| Driving attributes (≤3) | ... + the quantified target for each (from the table above) |
| Explicitly sacrificed | ... + the acceptable degradation, e.g. "search may lag ≤5 s" |
| Trade-off purchased | Use the "buy this / pay with this" table in `.claude/docs/architecture-knowledge.md` §19 — state cost, never just benefit |

**Availability arithmetic (compute it, never assert it):** dependencies in a request path MULTIPLY — five 99.9% deps ⇒ ~99.5% (≈43 h/yr down). Redundancy in PARALLEL adds 9s **only when failure modes are genuinely independent**; shared config, control plane, DNS and the deploy pipeline are the usual hidden serial term. Ladder: 99% = 3.65 d/yr · 99.9% = 8.77 h · 99.95% = 4.38 h · 99.99% = 52.6 min · 99.999% = 5.26 min.

**Cost is a quality attribute, not a later phase.** Model unit economics now — an architecture whose UNIT cost RISES with scale fails eventually regardless of elegance. Biggest web-system drivers: egress + cross-AZ/cross-region traffic · idle over-provisioned compute · unbounded log/metric/trace retention and cardinality · per-request managed-service pricing at steady high volume · always-on non-prod. Serverless vs always-on **inverts with utilization** — model it, don't assume it.

**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** validate derived requirements with user via `AskUserQuestion` before proceeding.

### 2-2: Pre-Decision Interrogation (MANDATORY for every one-way door from 2-0)

Answer the 15-question pre-decision script in `.claude/docs/architecture-knowledge.md` §20.1 for each one-way door BEFORE researching options. Record answers in the Step 11 report; any question answered "unknown" becomes an `Unresolved question`, never a silent gap.

The five that most often expose a wrong decision — never skip these:

| # | Question | Why it changes the answer |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 3 | Is this a one-way or two-way door, and what makes it so? | Sets how much rigour the decision earns; misclassification is this skill's most expensive failure |
| 5-6 | Expected load NOW and at 10× — and **what breaks FIRST**? | Names the actual bottleneck instead of the imagined one; 10×, never 1000× |
| 8 | What is the consistency requirement PER read path, and what staleness is acceptable? | Consistency is decided per path, never once globally |
| 14 | What existing thing could be used instead of building? | Generic subdomains (auth, billing, notifications, search) are the top source of wasted architecture budget |
| 15 | **What would have to be TRUE for this to be the WRONG choice — and how would I detect it?** | Becomes the ADR's measurable revisit trigger |

**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** a one-way door with no answer to question 15 is a BELIEF, not a decision — NEVER emit its ADR without a named falsifier and a measurable revisit trigger. — why: with no trigger nobody ever revisits it, so the decision outlives the constraints that justified it.

### Architecture & Scalability Scorecard Inputs (feeds `architecture-scalability-review`)

Record these decisions now so the init-time `architecture-scalability-review` scorecard (`mode=init`) can grade them later against **enforceable mechanisms, not intent**. Each row is a **design decision**, not a finding — capture the choice AND where it is enforced. Leave any unknown as explicit `Unresolved question` (Step 11), never a silent omission. — why: a scorecard can only grade decisions actually recorded with an enforcement home.

| Scorecard input | Design prompt (decide + record where enforced) | Enforcement handoff |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Build & CI scalability | As the codebase grows, how are build/CI times kept bounded? Decide **incremental** builds, changed/**affected**-only detection, local + **remote cache** strategy, and CI test/build parallelism. Name the build-system fit (single-package vs monorepo tool such as Nx / Turborepo / Bazel) **as an evaluated option**, not a default. | Step 7 (CI/CD provider parallelism + caching) |
| Horizontal scaling budgets | From the Step 2 scale targets, decide **stateless** app nodes, load balancing, caching tiers, async/queue + back-pressure, DB scale plan (sharding/partitioning/replication), connection pooling, rate limits, and a **SPOF** scan of every single-instance dependency. | ADR + Step 8 observability SLOs |
| Strategic DRY | Decide the **strategic DRY** / shared-knowledge strategy: monorepo, shared domain lib, custom platform / util lib — AND explicitly when NOT to share. Keep domain concepts OUT of generic/shared/infra layers (a shared layer coupled to one consumer's domain is no longer reusable). | Step 9 arch-rules + `scaffold` foundation |
| Dependency-boundary enforcement | Decide explicit dependency directions between modules/contexts and the mechanism that enforces them (no circular deps). | Step 9 "Arch rules / fitness" handoff → `linter-setup` |

These inputs are graded at init/audit by `architecture-scalability-review`; per-change regressions are caught by `architecture-review`. Do NOT turn this step into an auditor — record decisions here and route grading to those skills.

## Step 3: Backend Architecture

### 3A: Architecture Styles

WebSearch top 3 backend architecture styles. Candidates:

| Style                       | Best For                                 | Research Focus                            |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Clean Architecture**      | Complex domains, long-lived projects     | Dependency rule, testability, flexibility |
| **Hexagonal (Ports+Adapt)** | Integration-heavy, multiple I/O adapters | Port contracts, adapter isolation         |
| **Vertical Slice**          | Feature-focused teams, rapid delivery    | Slice isolation, code locality            |
| **Modular Monolith**        | Starting simple, eventual decomposition  | Module boundaries, migration path         |
| **Microservices**           | Large teams, independent deployment      | Service boundaries, operational overhead  |
| **CQRS + Event Sourcing**   | Audit-heavy, complex queries             | Read/write separation, event store        |
| **Layered (N-Tier)**        | Simple CRUD, small teams                 | Layer responsibilities, coupling risk     |

Full 16-style matrix with per-style *buys / costs / choose-when / avoid-when* → `.claude/docs/architecture-knowledge.md` §5.

#### Style selection procedure (MANDATORY order — never shortcut)

1. Take the ≤3 quantified driving attributes from Step 2-1.
2. **ELIMINATE** every style that cannot meet them (state which attribute eliminated it).
3. **DESIGN IT TWICE** — produce ≥2 MATERIALLY different surviving candidate designs (not two spellings of one idea) and write what each SACRIFICES. — why: committing to the first idea that occurred to you is the most common architecture failure and the one nobody records; a second real candidate is what makes the first one a choice.
4. Among survivors take the **SIMPLEST** — not the most capable.
5. Emit an ADR (Step 11) naming the rejected alternative AND the **measurable trigger** that would revisit the choice.

**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** design-it-twice applies to EVERY one-way door from 2-0, not only the style choice — data model, tenancy model, consistency model per read path, sync-vs-async at a boundary. NEVER emit a one-way-door ADR whose "Alternatives considered" section was written to justify a decision already made. — why: a retrofitted alternative is advocacy, not evaluation, and it hides the sacrifice the reviewer needs to see.

Styles COMPOSE — modular monolith + event-driven integration + 2-3 extracted services is the most common good real answer. Recommending a single pure style is usually a sign step 2 was skipped.

**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION — modulith-first default.** Default to a **modular monolith with CI-ENFORCED module boundaries** (architecture tests, Step 9) and extract services ONLY against a named, measured trigger from the table below. **Microservices are a destination reached under pressure, NEVER a starting point** — the 2025-2026 industry correction is documented: many organizations re-consolidated after debugging complexity, ops overhead and network latency outweighed autonomy gains. — why: distribution bought speculatively pays every distributed cost immediately and collects the benefit never.

| Legitimate extraction trigger (record BEFORE building) | NOT a trigger (reject these) |
| --- | --- |
| Independent scaling profile ≥10x divergent | "The codebase feels big" |
| Different compliance / data-residency boundary | "Microservices are best practice" |
| Different availability requirement | A resume, a conference talk, or framework support |
| A team boundary PROVABLY blocked by shared deploys | One slow endpoint (fix the endpoint) |
| Genuinely different runtime need (GPU, language, memory profile) | A new team was hired |
| Fault isolation for a KNOWN-unreliable dependency | The domain has many entities |

**MUST ATTENTION** verify platform maturity before recommending microservices: CI/CD, IaC, distributed tracing, on-call, and a platform team. Microservices without them is the most reliable predictor of a failed migration — recommend the modulith and say so explicitly.

**MUST ATTENTION** draw boundaries around **capabilities/behaviors** (`Checkout`, `Fulfilment`, `Pricing`), NEVER around **nouns/data** (`UserService`, `ProductService`). Entity-per-service guarantees every real use case must synchronously traverse many services — a distributed monolith produced by design. The unit of extraction is the **bounded context**, not the entity.

### 3B: Backend Design Patterns

Evaluate applicability per layer:

| Pattern             | Layer          | When to Apply                                     |

Per recommended pattern document: **Apply to**, **Why**, **Example**, **Risk if skipped**.

**MUST ATTENTION** patterns are a VOCABULARY for a solution you already need, never a menu to shop from — applying patterns to demonstrate knowledge produces the *gas factory* anti-pattern. The right number of patterns is the SMALLEST number that removes a DEMONSTRATED pain. Watch the chronically over-applied ones: Singleton (global mutable state → prefer one DI registration), Service Locator (hides dependencies from compiler and tests), CQRS on simple CRUD, event sourcing used as an audit log (an audit table is the right answer).

## Step 3C: Data & Consistency Architecture

> **Skip if:** the change touches no persistence, no consistency boundary, and no tenant-scoped data. Otherwise MANDATORY.

**Data outlives every service, framework and team — this is the MOST irreversible step in this skill.** Treat every row below as a one-way door (Step 2-0) until proven otherwise: each needs an ADR and a Step-12 validation question.

| Decision | Decide + record | Failure if skipped |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Store per access pattern** | Pick each store from the ACCESS PATTERN, not familiarity: relational (relations/transactions/ad-hoc queries — **the correct default**) · document (aggregate-shaped reads) · key-value (lookup/session) · wide-column (huge writes, known queries) · graph (traversal) · time-series (append + rollups) · search (relevance/facets) · vector (semantic/ANN) · columnar (aggregation scans) · object storage (blobs). Each ADDITIONAL store needs its own justification — polyglot persistence costs per store (ops, backup, monitoring, expertise, and transactional impossibility across stores). | Golden-hammer: the wrong store makes the dominant query permanently expensive |
| **One writer per dataset** | Name the single owning module/service for every dataset. Many READERS are fine — via API, replica, or published event stream. | Shared write access is shared coupling with NO contract; data diverges and nobody owns correctness |
| **NEVER integrate through the database** | External consumers get an API, an event stream, or at most a published view/replica — never your tables. | Fastest known path to a distributed monolith and to "we can never change this table" |
| **Consistency model per read path** | Per read path choose strong / causal / **session guarantees** (read-your-writes, monotonic reads) / eventual — and write the **STALENESS BUDGET** ("search index may lag ≤5 s") as a monitored SLI (Step 8). | Unbounded, unmeasured lag IS the defect. Most user-visible "consistency bugs" are missing read-your-writes from a lagging replica, NOT missing linearizability |
| **Replication + failover semantics** | Name topology (single-primary/read replicas, quorum, or multi-primary), write acknowledgement, sync vs async replicas, failover authority, conflict policy, and RPO/RTO. Route lag-sensitive/read-after-write reads to the primary or use a version/sticky-read guarantee. | Replicas improve read capacity/availability, not write capacity; async failover can lose acknowledged writes, sync raises latency/lowers availability, multi-primary creates conflicts |
| **Isolation level + check-then-act protection** | NAME the isolation level per critical write path — "we use transactions" says nothing about correctness. Read Committed permits **write skew** AND **lost update**; snapshot isolation permits **write skew** and — on any engine whose `REPEATABLE READ` is not true first-committer-wins SI — **lost update** too, so name the ENGINE as well as the level and protect every check-then-act invariant one of FOUR deliberate ways: a DB **constraint** (unique/check/exclusion — cheapest and most durable) · `SELECT … FOR UPDATE` on the rows read · **Serializable** + an app-side retry loop for serialization failures · a single atomic conditional write (`UPDATE … WHERE version = n`). An invariant spanning rows that DO NOT YET EXIST (no double-booking, no overlapping shift, at most N per tenant) cannot be protected by row locks. Full anomaly table → `.claude/docs/architecture-knowledge.md` §8. | Two concurrent transactions both pass their check and both write — the classic on-call corruption bug that passes every single-user test |
| **Storage engine + index strategy** | Choose B-Tree (mixed read/write, ad-hoc queries, strong secondary indexes) vs LSM (write-heavy ingest with known query shapes — pay with compaction stalls in p99 and space amplification). Record the **WAL/fsync policy** as the durability↔latency knob the RPO depends on. Index rules: composite indexes obey the **leftmost-prefix** rule (`(a,b,c)` never serves `b` alone) · covering indexes remove the row fetch · every index slows writes, so index-per-query-shape has a ceiling · size the connection pool by Little's Law. | An unpooled service DOSes its own database; a wrong engine makes the dominant workload permanently expensive; `fsync` settings chosen by default silently violate the stated RPO |
| **Storage substrate** | Block storage for database/filesystem volumes needing low-latency random I/O · object storage for blobs/media/backups/log archives and cheap durable scale · shared file storage only when filesystem semantics are required. Record lifecycle tiering, access frequency, object size, durability, egress and mutation pattern. | "User data uses block storage" confuses application model with physical substrate; large immutable blobs in the transactional database inflate backup, replication and query costs |
| **Distributed lock / leader election — fencing** | If any flow takes a distributed lock or elects a leader, name the **fencing token** (monotonic, rejected by the storage layer when stale), the lease duration, and the behaviour when the lease expires mid-operation. Consensus (Raft/Paxos) needs a MAJORITY — a 2-node or even-sized cluster buys nothing — and stays OFF the hot path. **NEVER order distributed events, compute expiry, or resolve conflicts by wall clock** — use versions/sequences, logical/vector clocks, or HLC. | An unfenced lock fails exactly once — under a GC/VM pause, at peak, writing corrupted state — and looks correct in every test (split brain) |
| **Transaction / aggregate boundary** | One aggregate per transaction; reference other aggregates **by ID only**; keep aggregates SMALL; cross-aggregate consistency is EVENTUAL via domain events. Money movement, uniqueness, inventory decrement and auth state stay **strong inside ONE aggregate/DB transaction**. | Large aggregates cause lock contention; cross-aggregate transactions force 2PC or silent divergence |
| **Cross-boundary transaction mechanism** | Local ACID (ALWAYS prefer) → saga + compensation → reservation/TCC. **AVOID 2PC/XA** in web-scale distributed systems. Compensations are NEW BUSINESS FACTS (`RefundIssued`), not technical rollbacks — design them as product decisions, and design for the intermediate state being USER-VISIBLE. | "We'll use a distributed transaction" is a non-answer that blocks on coordinator failure |
| **Tenancy model** | Shared-schema `tenant_id` (**default for most B2B SaaS**) · schema-per-tenant · DB-per-tenant (regulated / residency / white-label / large enterprise) · hybrid tiering (pooled small + siloed whales — the mature scale-up shape). | Retrofitting tenancy is a full data migration |
| **Tenant isolation ENFORCEMENT** | In a pooled model, name the LOWEST-layer mechanism: database **row-level security**, an ORM global filter/interceptor, or a mandatory repository base injecting tenant from the **authenticated principal** — plus a test asserting cross-tenant reads return zero rows (Step 6 + Step 9 fitness rule). **NEVER take `tenant_id` from a client-supplied field.** | One missing `WHERE tenant_id = ?` is a cross-tenant breach that passes every functional test |
| **Keys & partitioning** | Prefer **time-ordered IDs (UUIDv7/ULID/Snowflake)** — sequential ints leak volume and are enumerable; UUIDv4 destroys index locality on write. NEVER expose an internal sequential PK publicly. Partition key must be uniformly distributed AND query-aligned; plan resharding (consistent hashing / virtual buckets) BEFORE needing it. | Hot partitions (time-based ⇒ hot latest; tenant-based ⇒ whale tenants) and write amplification |
| **OLTP / OLAP separation** | Analytics go to a replica, CDC, or warehouse — never the transactional primary. | Reports saturating production is a top incident cause |
| **Denormalization / caching as a PURCHASE** | For each copy/cache, name authoritative source · policy (cache-aside/read-through/write-through/write-behind/refresh-ahead) · invalidation (TTL+jitter/event/versioned key/purge) · consistency window · max size/eviction. Design stampede/hot-key/cold-start protection (single-flight, early refresh, warm-up, LB slow-start). **NEVER cache authorization decisions or tenant data under a key omitting identity/tenant/permission.** | Stale data, stampedes and hot keys move rather than remove load; cache-key omission leaks tenants; an unbounded cache OOMs; a system correct only while cache is warm has made an undocumented source of truth |
| **Migration strategy** | **Expand–contract** (add nullable → dual write → backfill → switch reads → stop writing old → drop), forward-only, idempotent, non-blocking on large tables, deployable independently of the code using it. | A breaking migration in one deploy breaks old pods during a rolling deploy and makes rollback impossible |
| **Lifecycle: classification, retention, residency, deletion** | Classify (PII/PHI/PCI/public), set retention + archival tiering + deletion (GDPR/CCPA erasure) + residency NOW. | Retrofitting deletion into an event-sourced or heavily-denormalized system is brutally expensive — and erasure conflicts with immutable event stores by design |
| **RPO / RTO per dataset** | Set them PER DATASET (they drive topology and cost) and schedule a **restore drill**. | "We have backups" is a hypothesis; an undrilled DR plan has an RTO of "unknown" |

**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** emit an ADR for the store choice, the tenancy model, the consistency model per read path, and the key strategy — these four are the least reversible decisions in the entire design — why: each one reversed later is a full data migration with downtime, not a refactor.

## Step 3D: Integration & API Architecture

> **Skip if:** no boundary is crossed — no external consumer, no second service, no message bus, no third-party integration. Otherwise MANDATORY.

| Decision | Decide + record | Failure if skipped |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Sync vs async per boundary** | **Synchronous** only when the caller genuinely cannot proceed without the answer (user-awaited QUERIES). **Asynchronous** for EFFECTS (notification, fan-out, work completable later). A sync chain deeper than 2-3 hops is an availability + latency defect — flatten, cache, or make it an event. | Sync chains MULTIPLY availability (five 99.9% deps ⇒ 99.5%) and SUM latency |
| **Async acceptance contract** | When work moves behind a queue, define the public state machine: `accepted` (`202`/job ID) → pending/running/succeeded/failed/cancelled; status lookup or callback; retry visibility; terminal failure ownership. User feedback MUST say accepted, not completed. | Fast acknowledgement without completion semantics creates false success, invisible backlog, and unrecoverable business ambiguity |
| **API style per consumer** | REST/HTTP+JSON (public, broad compat, HTTP caching) · GraphQL (client-driven queries, aggregation — needs depth/complexity limits + persisted queries + dataloader or it becomes a DoS and N+1 surface) · gRPC (low-latency internal, streaming, codegen) · webhooks (push to third parties — needs retries + signature verification) · WebSocket/SSE (real-time; SSE when one-way suffices). | Wrong style makes the dominant interaction chatty or uncacheable |
| **Versioning + deprecation policy** | Version from **day one** (URL path versioning is the pragmatic default); version the CONTRACT, not every field; support ≥N-1 with a published deprecation policy + per-version usage telemetry. | Versionless contracts mean any producer change breaks consumers — and you cannot tell who |
| **Contract-first + contract tests in CI** | OpenAPI / protobuf / AsyncAPI as the source of truth; consumer-driven contract tests are what make independent deploys SAFE (Step 6 + Step 9 gate). Tolerant reader — unknown fields ignored, never fatal. | Without contract tests, "independently deployable" is an aspiration, not a property |
| **Write-then-publish ⇒ transactional outbox or CDC** | **MANDATORY** whenever a flow writes the DB *and* publishes. **NEVER two independent operations.** | **Dual-write:** DB commits + publish fails ⇒ silent divergence; publish succeeds + DB rolls back ⇒ phantom downstream data |
| **Idempotency everywhere** | Exactly-once DELIVERY is impossible (Two Generals/FLP) ⇒ **effectively-once via idempotency**. Idempotency keys (with the stored RESULT + TTL) on all unsafe mutations; consumers dedup on message ID; prefer naturally idempotent operations (`SET status='paid'` over `balance += x`); optimistic concurrency via version/ETag. Assume **duplicate, out-of-order and delayed** arrival — carry a version/sequence and discard backward transitions. | Duplicate side effects: double charge, double email, double shipment |
| **Message taxonomy — never conflate** | **Command** ("do this", one handler, may be rejected) vs **Event/fact** ("this happened", 0..N subscribers, cannot be rejected) vs query vs document message. An "event" with exactly one permitted consumer that MUST handle it, whose failure means the flow failed, is a **COMMAND in an event costume** — name it a command and own the coupling honestly. | You pay async debugging difficulty AND keep sync coupling |
| **Event granularity per stream** | Deliberate choice: thin/notification (ID only — restores temporal coupling + read load) vs fat/state-transfer (self-contained, leaks more model, bigger payloads) vs hybrid (thin event + queryable snapshot endpoint). **NEVER leak raw DB rows as events** — CDC without a mapping layer publishes your internal schema as a frozen public contract (Hyrum). | Consumers become coupled to columns you can then never rename |
| **Schema evolution** | Versioned, registered, backward-compatible event schemas with a CI compatibility check. In event sourcing, event schemas are public contracts **forever**. | One producer change silently breaks every consumer |
| **Broker semantics — ordering, replay, durability** | Decide the three properties BEFORE naming a vendor: required **ordering scope** (global / per-entity-key / none) · required **replay window** (queue = consume-and-gone; log = offset-based replay by many consumer groups) · **durability acknowledgement** (replication factor + min-in-sync-replicas + producer acks — `acks=1` accepts data loss on leader failure, and `acks=all` waits for the replicas CURRENTLY in the ISR — so `min.insync=1` still waits for a healthy 3-replica ISR but silently degrades to `acks=1` durability once the ISR shrinks to the leader alone). Log partition count is hard to raise without rekeying, and ordering on a key costs parallelism on that key. Health SLI: queue depth + oldest-message age, or **consumer lag** for a log. | Vendor picked first ⇒ the one property you actually needed (ordering, replay, or durability) turns out to be the one that is expensive to change |
| **Load-balancing + rate-limiting algorithm** | LB: **least-outstanding-requests is the best general default** (routes away from slow hosts automatically) · power-of-two-choices · consistent hashing only for cache/shard affinity (accept hot keys) · **slow-start for new instances** so a cold cache/JIT node is not handed full traffic. Rate limiting: **token bucket** for burst-tolerant public APIs · sliding-window counter for accuracy · **concurrency/in-flight limiter when per-request cost is unknown or highly variable** (it bounds the resource, not the count). Limit BY the protected dimension (tenant/principal/endpoint), never only by IP; always return `Retry-After`. Distributed enforcement needs a shared counter (new hot-path dependency) or per-node quota division (accept `N×` slack) — state which. | Round-robin ignores request cost and feeds a dying host; fixed-window limiters permit a 2× burst across the boundary; sticky sessions become the reason state was never externalized |
| **Queue hygiene** | **Bounded** queues + DLQ + a redrive procedure + DLQ-depth alerting; capped exponential backoff **with jitter**; poison-message handling. | An unbounded queue converts a throughput problem into unbounded latency then OOM; a DLQ nobody watches is data loss with extra steps; unjittered retries synchronize into a thundering herd |
| **Resilience config on EVERY outbound call** | Timeout (derived from the caller's remaining budget) on every network call, lock and query · capped jittered retries for idempotent ops ONLY · retry BUDGET as a % of traffic · circuit breaker with a defined fallback · bulkheads per dependency/tenant · load shedding at the edge by priority. | **A missing timeout is the single most common resilience defect**; retry amplification turns a blip into an outage. The dangerous failure is SLOW, not down — it exhausts your resources while looking healthy |
| **Graceful degradation per feature** | Pre-decide the degraded mode per feature (stale data / hide module / read-only) — a PRODUCT decision, made now, not during the incident. | Undesigned degradation becomes a total outage |
| **Trust boundary rules** | Validate at the boundary (allow-list); **NEVER trust client-supplied authorization data** — IDs, roles, prices, tenant IDs come from the authenticated principal. Machine-readable error contract (stable `code`, `message`, `details`, `traceId`; RFC 9457 problem+json is a good default) — NEVER leak stack traces. Propagate a correlation/trace ID through EVERY hop including async. | Broken access control is the #1 real-world risk; untraceable async hops make incidents unexplainable |
| **Edge component responsibilities** | Gateway = TLS, routing, authn, rate limiting, quotas, versioning — **NEVER business logic**. CDN/edge = static + deliberately cacheable dynamic content; record push/pull origin strategy, `Cache-Control`, `Vary`/cache-key dimensions, TTL and purge/versioning. BFF only when a client genuinely needs owned aggregation; skip with one client or when GraphQL fills the role. | Smart gateways duplicate domain rules; careless edge caching serves stale or personalized data to the wrong audience; missing cache policy shifts global latency/load back to origin |

**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** every sync-vs-async choice at a boundary and every public API/event contract is a one-way door — ADR + Step-12 validation, no exceptions — why: consumers you cannot see will depend on both, and Hyrum's Law makes every observable behavior a contract you must then keep.

## Step 6: Testing Architecture

Research best testing tools, strategy for confirmed tech stack:

| Testing Layer           | What to Research                                  | Top Candidates to Compare                    |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Unit Testing**        | Test runner, assertion library, mocking framework | Repository's configured unit-test stack       |
| **Integration Testing** | API testing, DB testing, service testing          | Supertest, TestContainers, WebAppFactory     |
| **E2E Testing**         | Browser automation, BDD, visual regression        | Playwright/Cypress/Selenium, SpecFlow        |
| **Performance Testing** | Load testing, stress testing, benchmarking        | k6/Artillery/JMeter/NBomber, BenchmarkDotNet |
| **Contract Testing**    | API contract validation between services          | Pact, Dredd, Spectral                        |
| **Mutation Testing**    | Test quality validation                           | Stryker, PITest                              |
| **Coverage**            | Code coverage collection, reporting, enforcement  | Istanbul/Coverlet, SonarQube                 |
| **Test Data**           | Factories, fixtures, seeders, fakers              | Bogus/AutoFixture/Faker.js                   |

### Test Strategy Template

```markdown
### Test Pyramid

- **Unit (70%):** {framework} — {what to test}
- **Integration (20%):** {framework} — {what to test}
- **E2E (10%):** {framework} — {what to test}

### Test-Strength Targets

- Line coverage (diagnostic only — NEVER fail the build on a coverage %): Unit: {X}% | Integration: {X}% | E2E: critical paths only
- Gate: mutation score ({tool}) in CI pipeline — fail build on surviving mutants / mutation-score regression, not on a line-coverage %
```

## Step 7: CI/CD & Deployment

Research deployment architecture, CI/CD tooling:

| Concern                 | What to Research                                     | Top Candidates to Compare                     |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **CI/CD Provider**      | Pipeline orchestration, parallelism, caching         | Repository's configured CI/CD tooling          |
| **Containerization**    | Container runtime, image building, registry          | Docker/Podman, BuildKit, ACR/ECR/GHCR         |
| **Orchestration**       | Container orchestration, service mesh, scaling       | Kubernetes/Docker Compose/ECS/Nomad           |
| **IaC (Infra as Code)** | Infrastructure provisioning, drift detection         | Terraform/Pulumi/Bicep/CDK                    |
| **Artifact Management** | Package registry, versioning, vulnerability scanning | NuGet/npm/Artifactory/GitHub Packages         |
| **Feature Flags**       | Progressive rollout, A/B testing, kill switches      | LaunchDarkly/Unleash/Flagsmith                |
| **Secret Management**   | Vault, key rotation, environment variables           | Azure KeyVault/HashiCorp Vault/SOPS           |
| **Database Migration**  | Schema versioning, rollback, seed data               | EF Migrations/Flyway/Liquibase/dbmate         |

### Deployment Strategy Comparison

| Strategy          | Risk | Downtime | Complexity | Best For                 |
| ----------------- | ---- | -------- | ---------- | ------------------------ |
| **Blue-Green**    | Low  | Zero     | Medium     | Critical services        |
| **Canary**        | Low  | Zero     | High       | Gradual rollout          |
| **Rolling**       | Med  | Zero     | Low        | Stateless services       |
| **Recreate**      | High | Yes      | Low        | Dev/staging environments |
| **Feature Flags** | Low  | Zero     | Medium     | Feature-level control    |

### Release-safety rules (decide + record — these bind Step 3C/3D contracts to the pipeline)

| Rule | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| **Decouple deploy from release** | Flags / canary with SLI gates + auto-rollback. A flag needs an EXPIRY date or it becomes permanent branching complexity |
| **Backward AND forward compatible for one version** | **MANDATORY** — a rolling deploy runs both versions SIMULTANEOUSLY. Applies to APIs, event schemas AND database schemas alike |
| **Expand–contract migrations** | Add nullable → dual write → backfill → switch reads → stop writing old → drop. Forward-only, idempotent, non-blocking, deployed INDEPENDENTLY of the code using it. **NEVER a breaking schema change in one deploy** |
| **One artifact, external config** | Build once, promote the same artifact across environments (12-factor); config and secrets injected per environment |
| **Graceful shutdown** | Stop accepting → drain in-flight with a deadline → flush buffers/metrics → close pools → exit. Without it EVERY deploy sheds requests |
| **Liveness ≠ readiness** | Readiness reflects dependencies; **liveness must NOT** (or one dependency blip restarts the whole fleet). Add startup probes for slow boots |
| **Legacy replacement** | Strangler fig (facade + capability-by-capability routing) or branch by abstraction, with **parallel run / shadow compare** for high-risk replacements. **NEVER a big-bang rewrite** of a system you don't fully understand — you inherit all undocumented behavior as invisible requirements |
| **DORA as delivery SLIs** | Deploy frequency, lead time, change-failure rate, MTTR — measure outcomes, never proxy metrics (Goodhart) |

**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** if the design changes a database schema or a published contract, the migration plan is part of THIS design, not an implementation detail deferred to `plan-execute` — why: a schema change designed without expand–contract makes the whole release irreversible.

---

## Step 8: Observability & Monitoring

| Concern | What to Research | Top Candidates to Compare |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Structured Logging** | JSON schema, levels, trace/request/tenant correlation, redaction | Serilog/NLog/Winston/Pino |
| **Log Aggregation** | Durable centralized search, retention, sampling | ELK/Loki/Datadog/Seq |
| **Metrics backend** | Counters/gauges/histograms, scrape/push model, cardinality cost | Prometheus/App Insights/Datadog |
| **Telemetry instrumentation + transport** | Vendor-neutral logs/metrics/traces, context propagation across sync + async | OpenTelemetry |
| **Distributed tracing backend** | Trace storage/query, sampling, service graph | Jaeger/Zipkin/Tempo/vendor APM |
| **Visualization** | Service + user-journey dashboards across data sources | Grafana/vendor dashboards |
| **Alerting** | SLO burn-rate/symptom alerts, actionable routing + runbooks | PagerDuty/OpsGenie/Grafana Alerting |
| **Health Checks** | Liveness, readiness, startup probes | Stack-native health framework |
| **Uptime Monitoring** | External availability and SLA tracking | UptimeRobot/Pingdom/Checkly |

**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** keep the signal roles distinct: Prometheus-class systems store/query metrics; log backends store logs; trace backends store traces; Grafana-class tools visualize; OpenTelemetry instruments and transports telemetry. Define RED/USE/golden signals, SLIs→SLOs→error budgets, sampling for routine volume, full-fidelity critical-operation telemetry, bounded retention/cardinality, PII redaction, and alerts only when actionable. — why: collecting everything without signal ownership creates cost and noise, not observability.

### Observability Decision: 3 Pillars

```markdown
### Recommended Observability Stack

| Pillar   | Tool   | Why         |
| -------- | ------ | ----------- |
| Logs     | {tool} | {rationale} |
| Metrics  | {tool} | {rationale} |
| Traces   | {tool} | {rationale} |
| Alerting | {tool} | {rationale} |
```

## Step 9: Code Quality & Clean Code Enforcement

Research, recommend tooling for automated code quality:

| Concern                    | What to Research                                   | Top Candidates to Compare                     |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Linter (Backend)**       | Static analysis, code style, bug detection         | Roslyn Analyzers/SonarQube/StyleCop/ReSharper |
| **Linter (Frontend)**      | JS/TS linting, accessibility, complexity           | ESLint/Biome/oxlint                           |
| **Formatter**              | Auto-formatting, consistent style                  | Prettier/dotnet-format/EditorConfig           |
| **Code Analyzer**          | Security scanning, complexity metrics, duplication | SonarQube/CodeClimate/Codacy                  |
| **Pre-commit Hooks**       | Git hooks, staged file validation                  | Husky+lint-staged/pre-commit/Lefthook         |
| **Editor Config**          | Cross-IDE consistency                              | .editorconfig/IDE-specific configs            |
| **Architecture Rules**     | Layer dependency enforcement, naming conventions   | ArchUnit/NetArchTest/Dependency-Cruiser       |
| **API Design Standards**   | OpenAPI validation, naming, versioning             | Spectral/Redocly/swagger-lint                 |
| **Commit Conventions**     | Commit message format, changelog generation        | Commitlint/Conventional Commits               |
| **Code Review Automation** | Automated PR review, suggestion bots               | Danger.js/Reviewdog/CodeRabbit                |

### Enforcement Strategy

```markdown
### Code Quality Gates

| Gate        | Tool   | Trigger        | Fail Criteria         |
| ----------- | ------ | -------------- | --------------------- |
| Pre-commit  | {tool} | git commit     | Lint errors, format   |
| PR Check    | {tool} | Pull request   | Surviving mutants / mutation-score regression, issues (line-coverage diagnostic only) |
| CI Pipeline | {tool} | Push to branch | Build fail, test fail |
| Scheduled   | {tool} | Weekly/nightly | Security vulns, debt  |
```

### Scaffold Handoff (MANDATORY — consumed by `/scaffold`)

After code-quality research, produce this handoff table in the architecture report. `/scaffold` reads it to generate actual config files — without it, scaffold cannot auto-configure quality tooling. — why: the handoff table is the only contract scaffold has for tool choices.

```markdown
### Scaffold Handoff — Tool Choices

| Concern        | Chosen Tool       | Config File | Rationale |
| -------------- | ----------------- | ----------- | --------- |
| Linter (FE)    | {tool}            | {filename}  | {why}     |
| Linter (BE)    | {tool}            | {filename}  | {why}     |
| Formatter      | {tool}            | {filename}  | {why}     |
| Pre-commit     | {tool}            | {filename}  | {why}     |
| Arch rules / fitness | {tool: ArchUnit / NetArchTest / Dependency-Cruiser} | {filename} | {layer + dependency rules and Step-2 NFR budgets to enforce} |
| Error handling | {pattern}         | {files}     | {why}     |
| Loading state  | {pattern}         | {files}     | {why}     |
| Docker         | {compose pattern} | {files}     | {why}     |
```

**Also include:** Error handling strategy (4-layer pattern), loading state approach (global vs per-component), Docker profile structure. Specific tool choices → `docs/project-reference/` or `project-config.json`. The **Arch rules / fitness** row MUST encode Step-2 quality-attribute budgets and layer/dependency rules as executable checks — `harness-setup` wires these into CI so recorded ADR decisions stay enforced, not merely documented. — why: documented-but-unenforced budgets erode silently as code changes.

**Example patterns to scaffold (golden-path reference set):** the handoff MUST also name the worked, copy-me examples `/scaffold` emits under an isolated, production-excluded `examples/` tree — one per applicable pattern, using the scaffolded base abstractions, so the post-scaffold `/architecture-review-full` has real code to grade. Target set (≥ 11 when a UI is present; skip absent layers and log why):

```markdown
### Scaffold Handoff — Golden-Path Examples

| Layer     | Example patterns (one worked `*.example.*` each)                                                        |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Backend   | command · query · command/query handler · entity-with-invariants · value-object · repository (concrete) · domain event + event handler |
| Frontend  | form component · list component · state store · API service  *(only if a UI stack is present)*          |
| Tests     | one integration test exercising an example command/query on BOTH the happy path AND a failure path      |
```

Every example carries the `GOLDEN-PATH EXAMPLE — copy into src/ …; NOT compiled into the production build` header, contains NO secrets/real endpoints (placeholders only: `EXAMPLE_API_KEY`, `example.invalid`), and compiles/lints under the CI (non-production) target. — why: empty base abstractions are unverified skeletons; one worked example per pattern turns each into demonstrated, reviewable, copy-me usage.

## Step 10: Dependency Risk Assessment

Per recommended library/package, evaluate maintenance, obsolescence risk:

### Package Health Scorecard

| Criteria                  | Score (1-5) | How to Verify                                    |
| ------------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Last Release Date**     | ...         | npm/NuGet page — stale if >12 months             |
| **Open Issues Ratio**     | ...         | GitHub issues open vs closed                     |
| **Maintainer Count**      | ...         | Bus factor — single maintainer = high risk       |
| **Breaking Change Freq.** | ...         | Changelog — frequent major versions = churn cost |
| **Dependency Depth**      | ...         | `npm ls --depth` / dependency graph depth        |
| **Known Vulnerabilities** | ...         | Snyk/npm audit/GitHub Dependabot                 |
| **License Compatibility** | ...         | SPDX identifier — check viral licenses (GPL)     |
| **Community Activity**    | ...         | Monthly commits, PR merge rate, Discord/forums   |
| **Migration Path**        | ...         | Can swap to alternative if abandoned?            |
| **Framework Alignment**   | ...         | Official recommendation by framework team?       |

### Risk Categories

| Risk Level   | Criteria                                          | Action                                 |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Low**      | Active, >3 maintainers, recent release, no CVEs   | Use freely                             |
| **Medium**   | 1-2 maintainers, release <6mo, minor CVEs patched | Use with monitoring plan               |
| **High**     | Single maintainer, >12mo stale, open CVEs         | Find alternative or plan exit strategy |
| **Critical** | Abandoned, unpatched CVEs, deprecated             | DO NOT USE — find replacement          |

### Dependency Maintenance Strategy

```markdown
### Recommended Practices

1. **Automated scanning:** {tool} (Dependabot/Renovate/Snyk) — weekly PR for updates
2. **Lock file strategy:** Commit lock files, pin major versions, allow patch auto-update
3. **Audit schedule:** Monthly `npm audit` / `dotnet list package --vulnerable`
4. **Vendor policy:** Max {N} dependencies per concern, prefer well-maintained alternatives
5. **Exit strategy:** For each High-risk dependency, document migration path to alternative
```

---

## Step 11: Generate Report

Write report to `{plan-dir}/research/architecture-design.md` with sections:

1. Executive summary (recommended architecture in 8-10 lines)
2. Architecture requirements table + **workload profile and ordered scaling ladder** + **reversibility ranking (one-way vs two-way doors)** + **≤3 driving attributes and what is SACRIFICED** + cost unit economics (from Step 2)
3. Backend architecture — style comparison **with the elimination rationale per rejected style + the recorded extraction trigger** + recommended patterns (Step 3A/3B)
4. **Data & consistency architecture — stores/substrates per access pattern, dataset writer ownership, replication/failover semantics, consistency model + staleness budget per read path, cache contract, transaction/aggregate boundaries, tenancy model + isolation enforcement mechanism, keys/partitioning, migration strategy, retention/residency, RPO/RTO per dataset (Step 3C)**
5. **Integration & API architecture — sync-vs-async per boundary, API style per consumer, versioning + deprecation policy, contract tests, outbox/CDC, idempotency strategy, event granularity + schema evolution, queue hygiene, resilience config, degradation modes (Step 3D)**
6. Frontend architecture — style comparison + recommended patterns (Step 4)
7. Library ecosystem — per-concern recommendations with alternatives (Step 5)
8. Testing architecture — pyramid, tools, coverage targets, **contract tests + tenant-isolation test** (Step 6)
9. CI/CD & deployment — pipeline design, deployment strategy, **expand–contract migration plan + rolling-deploy compatibility** (Step 7)
10. Observability stack — logs/metrics/traces/profiles/change-events, instrumentation/transport vs storage vs visualization roles, sampling/cardinality/retention, alerting + **the staleness/lag SLIs declared in Step 3C** (Step 8)
11. Code quality — enforcement gates, tooling, **fitness functions per architectural rule** (Step 9)
12. Dependency risk matrix — high-risk packages, mitigation (Step 10)
13. Architecture diagram (Mermaid — all layers, data flow, **trust boundaries and failure domains**)
14. **Cost model — `$/request` or `$/tenant`, the dominant drivers, and whether unit cost rises with scale**
15. Risk assessment for overall architecture — **including the anti-patterns deliberately accepted and why**
16. Unresolved questions

**MUST ATTENTION** every diagram needs a legend, a date and an owner — an undated diagram is a rumor. Show trust boundaries and failure domains explicitly: that is the entire point of drawing a deployment view.

### Emit ADRs for hard-to-reverse decisions (MANDATORY)

For each decision significant AND costly to reverse — **every one-way door classified in Step 2-0**: backend/frontend style, data model + key strategy, tenancy model, consistency model per read path, sync-vs-async at a boundary, public API/event contract, service boundary lines, auth/identity model, data residency + retention, messaging approach, a Step-2 quality-attribute budget, a rejected-with-reason alternative — write one ADR to `docs/adr/{NNNN}-{slug}.md` following the repo's existing ADR format (Status, Date, Context, Decision, Consequences [Positive/Negative/Neutral], Alternatives Considered, Related; see `docs/adr/0001-skill-lifecycle.md` for canonical shape). Start `Status: Proposed`; promote to `Accepted` after Step-12 user validation confirms it. These ADRs are the binding record `architecture-review` Category 9 checks changed code against — **a decision not written as an ADR cannot be enforced downstream.** Route ADR authoring through the `architect` sub-agent for cross-service/security/performance impact analysis.

**ADR minimum content — the two most-skipped fields are the most valuable:** Context (forces, constraints, quantified attributes) · Decision · **Alternatives considered WITH why each was rejected** (prevents relitigating, and later explains the constraint to whoever is tempted to break it) · Consequences (what we now CANNOT do easily) · Status · **Revisit trigger** (the measurement that would reopen this decision).

**MUST ATTENTION** an architectural rule NOT automatically verified is a SUGGESTION and will be violated within one quarter. Every ADR-recorded constraint that CAN be machine-checked MUST also land in the Step-9 Scaffold Handoff as an executable fitness rule (layer/dependency rules, no module cycles, domain purity, API + event schema compatibility, tenant-isolation test, "every outbound call has a timeout", bundle/latency budgets, cost-per-request regression). Pay existing architectural debt with a **RATCHET** — block new violations in CI, then decrement the existing count — never with a "cleanup sprint later" that never happens.

## Step 12: User Validation Interview

**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** present findings, ask 8-12 questions via `AskUserQuestion`:

### Required Questions

1. **Workload + driving attributes + sacrifices** — "The workload is {read/write ratio, peak load, growth, skew, geography}; the first expected bottleneck is {component}, so the scaling path is {ordered rungs}. I optimized for {≤3 attributes} and am SACRIFICING {list}. Correct priorities?"
2. **Backend architecture** — "I recommend {style}; I eliminated {alternatives} because {attribute}. The trigger that would make us extract services is {measurable trigger}. Agree?"
3. **Consistency model + staleness budget** *(one-way door)* — "{read path} will be eventually consistent with a ≤{N}s staleness budget; {other path} stays strongly consistent. Acceptable to the business?"
4. **Tenancy + isolation** *(one-way door)* — "Tenancy is {model}, isolation enforced by {mechanism}. Any tenant needing stronger isolation or its own residency?"
5. **Sync vs async boundaries** *(one-way door)* — "{boundary} is async, so {effect} completes eventually and the user sees {intermediate state}. Acceptable UX?"
6. **Frontend architecture** — "I recommend {style} with {state management}. Agree?"
7. **Design patterns** — "Recommended backend patterns: {list}. Frontend patterns: {list}. Any to add/remove?"
8. **Key libraries** — "For {concern}, I recommend {lib} over {alternatives}. Agree?"
9. **Testing strategy** — "Test pyramid: {unit}%/{integration}%/{E2E}% using {frameworks}, plus contract tests at {boundaries}. Appropriate?"
10. **CI/CD + migration safety** — "Pipeline: {tool} with {deployment strategy}, schema changes via expand–contract. Fits your infra?"
11. **Observability** — "Monitoring stack: {logs}/{metrics}/{traces}, with {staleness/lag SLIs}. Sufficient?"
12. **Code quality + fitness functions** — "Enforcement: {linter + formatter + hooks + architecture tests}. Team ready for CI to BLOCK on boundary violations?"
13. **Dependency risk** — "Found {N} high-risk dependencies. Accept or find alternatives?"
14. **Cost + complexity check** — "Estimated {$/request or $/tenant}; {N} concerns addressed. Appropriate for team size and budget?"

Ask the **one-way-door questions first** — they are the ones the user actually owns. Two-way doors do not deserve a validation slot.

### Optional Deep-Dive Questions (pick 2-3)

- "Should we use event sourcing or traditional state-based persistence?" *(if the answer is "we want an audit log", the answer is an audit table)*
- "Monolith-first or start with service boundaries?"
- "Micro frontends or monolith SPA?"
- "How important is framework independence for this repository or system?"
- "Self-hosted observability or managed SaaS?"
- "Strict lint rules from day 1 or gradual adoption?"
- "What is the acceptable degraded mode when {critical dependency} is down — stale data, hidden feature, or read-only?"
- "RPO/RTO per dataset — how much data loss and downtime is genuinely acceptable, and who signs off on the restore drill?"
- "Is any data regulated or residency-bound in a way that forces per-tenant or per-region isolation?"

After user confirms, update report with final decisions, mark `status: confirmed`.

## Best Practices Audit (applied across all steps)

Validate architecture against these principles — flag violations in report. — why: an unflagged SOLID/DRY violation compounds into rework once code lands on the flaw.

## Next Steps

**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION — NO EXCEPTIONS** after completing this skill, you MUST ATTENTION use `AskUserQuestion` to present these options. NEVER skip because the task seems "simple" or "obvious" — the user decides:

- **"/plan (Recommended)"** — Create implementation plan from architecture design
- **"/refine"** — If need to create PBIs first
- **"Skip, continue manually"** — user decides

### Council escalation (always-offer, second prompt)

After the existing `## Next Steps` prompt above resolves, present a **second**, independent `AskUserQuestion` call (NEVER merge into the first):

- **"Skip council — proceed (Recommended)"** — Continue with the architecture decision as-is. Recommended default.
- **"Escalate to /llm-council"** — Run 11 sub-agent council (5 advisors + 5 reviewers + chairman). Use when this architecture pick is hard to reverse and you need adversarial framing. Cheaper alternatives: `/why-review`, `/plan-validate` (run these first if you haven't).

## Anti-Rationalization (reject these excuses)

| Excuse the model tells itself                          | Reality                                                                                            |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "I know this stack — skip the 3-options research"     | Familiarity ≠ evidence. Research 3+ options with cited proof per concern, every time.              |
| "The architecture is obvious — skip user validation"  | Step 12 is MANDATORY. The user owns hard-to-reverse decisions; never auto-decide.                  |
| "No scale numbers given, I'll just pick a style"      | Missing target = explicit `Unresolved question`, never a silent guess. Quantify via Step-2 first.  |
| "It's a small feature — skip the ADR"                 | If a decision is significant AND costly to reverse, it needs an ADR or it cannot be enforced.      |
| "Brownfield, but my preferred style is better"        | NEVER re-litigate a settled ADR-recorded decision without a superseding-ADR rationale.             |
| "I'll document the budget, enforcement is optional"   | Documented-but-unenforced budgets erode. Encode them as executable fitness checks for CI.          |
| "Microservices are the modern default"                | Modulith-first. Distribution needs a named, MEASURED extraction trigger — and CI/CD + tracing + a platform team first. |
| "It's a data decision, the devs can sort it out"      | Data model, tenancy, consistency model and keys are the LEAST reversible decisions here (Step 3C). ADR + validate. |
| "We'll just write the DB then publish the event"      | That is a dual write. Outbox or CDC — no exceptions (Step 3D).                                      |
| "The queue guarantees exactly-once"                   | Exactly-once DELIVERY is impossible. Design idempotent consumers for duplicate + out-of-order arrival. |
| "Eventual consistency is fine here"                   | Then state the STALENESS BUDGET and monitor it as an SLI. Unbounded, unmeasured lag IS the defect.  |
| "I'll add resilience/observability/cost later"        | They are quality attributes decided in THIS pass. Retrofitting them costs a redesign.               |
| "One good design is enough — writing a second wastes time" | Design-it-twice (Step 3A) is what turns a first idea into a CHOICE. A one-way door with one candidate has not been decided. |
| "We take a distributed lock, so it's safe"            | An unfenced lock does not prevent split brain. Name the fencing token, the lease duration, and the expiry behaviour (Step 3C). |
| "The ORM handles transactions"                        | Name the ISOLATION LEVEL. Read Committed and snapshot isolation both permit write skew — protect every check-then-act invariant explicitly (Step 3C). |
| "We'll use Kafka / Redis / Kubernetes for that"       | Prescribe the TACTIC, not the product (Step 2). Name the ordering/replay/durability property you need, then let that select the tool. |
| "Best practice says…"                                 | Name the FORCES it balances and the constraints of the company it came from. "Best practice" with no named sacrifice is red flag #5 (`architecture-knowledge.md` §20.3). |

### Self-audit your OWN draft before emitting (MANDATORY)

Run the 11 thinking red flags in `.claude/docs/architecture-knowledge.md` §20.3 against this design and every recommendation in it. Any hit invalidates the REASONING, not just the wording — fix the decision, not the sentence. The three that most often fire in this skill: **technology picked before the requirement was stated** · **cannot name what the recommendation SACRIFICES** · **designing for a scale you cannot evidence**. — why: a design that fails its own self-audit will pass review on presentation quality and fail in production on the unexamined assumption.

<!-- SYNC:scenario-stress-eval -->

> **Scenario Stress & Resilience Evaluation** — CONDITIONAL, evidence-gated, business-criticality-aware. The top-down companion to `SYNC:scale-technique-gate`: instead of *"is technique X present?"*, put the system UNDER concrete failure/load scenarios and judge whether it SURVIVES, SELF-HEALS, and whether its BUSINESS needs it to. **ADVICE-ONLY: emit the Scenario Stress Matrix as guidance; NEVER mutate any score, verdict band, or gate pass/fail.**
>
> 1. **Reuse the scale tier** derived by `SYNC:scale-technique-gate` (or derive it identically from evidence); **also derive business-criticality `B0`–`B3`** from specs/SLA/product docs + the domain, cite `file:line` + confidence. `B0` best-effort · `B1` important · `B2` business-critical · `B3` mission-critical/regulated. Unknown → state the assumption, do **NOT** default to `B3`/`T3`. **Criticality-signal floor (both-directions safety):** regulated / PII / financial / health data, money movement, auth/identity, or legal-compliance scope raises `B` to **at least `B2` even absent SLA/SLO docs**; anti-over-engineering lowers hardening ONLY when NO such signal is present. `B` (blast if it fails) and `T` (scale of load/data) are independent — a low-traffic payroll run is low-`T`, high-`B`.
> 2. **Select in-scope scenarios** — only those the system's `B`/`T` combination warrants (a `B0` internal PoC skips region-loss/DR entirely; a `B3`/`T0` regulated service still needs backups + DR by BUSINESS, not scale).
> 3. **Walk each in-scope scenario:** simulate the stimulus → trace the break path → name the failure signature → answer the self-heal/recovery question (auto-recover? MTTR? manual runbook?) → name the trade-off it forces. Families: traffic spike · sustained growth · data-volume growth · write/ingest burst · dependency down/slow · instance/node loss · zone/region loss · **data loss/corruption** · poison-message/retry-storm · cascading failure/backpressure · cold-start/deploy-blip · clock-skew/duplicate-delivery.
> 4. **Assign one verdict per scenario:** `WITHSTANDS` · `DEGRADES-GRACEFULLY` · `FAILS-HARD` (→ **advise only**) · `N/A-by-business` (not warranted → skip, not a gap) · `OVER-HARDENED` (resilience beyond business need → **advise AGAINST**, cite carrying cost).
> 5. **Anti-over-engineering guard (first-class):** a lean system whose business does not need HA/DR is a PASS; `OVER-HARDENED` flags resilience the business does not warrant. This guard is symmetric with the criticality-signal floor above — never under-harden a `B2`+ system just because its traffic is low.
> 6. **Output — Scenario Stress Matrix:** `scenario | in-scope (B/T)? | verdict | self-heal | trade-off | evidence (file:line/config/infra)`. Full catalog + Business×Scale in-scope baseline + verdict/tier tables → `.claude/docs/scenario-stress-catalog.md`. **ADVISORY-ONLY: NEVER mutate any `/20`, `/24`, verdict band, or gate pass/fail.

<!-- PROMPT-ENHANCE:STEP-TASK-CLOSING:START -->

## Prompt-Enhance Closing Anchors

- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** follow declared step order for this skill; NEVER skip, reorder, or merge steps without explicit user approval
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** for every step/sub-skill call: set `in_progress` before execution, set `completed` after execution
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** every skipped step MUST include explicit reason; every completed step MUST include concise evidence
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** if Task tools unavailable, maintain an equivalent step-by-step plan tracker with synchronized statuses

<!-- PROMPT-ENHANCE:STEP-TASK-CLOSING:END -->

<!-- SYNC:parallel-subagent-dispatch -->

> **Parallel Sub-Agent Dispatch** — Plan parallelism the moment a task breakdown exists, BEFORE executing it — running provably independent tasks sequentially wastes wall-clock. Applies to every multi-step job: workflow steps, planning, batch updates, investigation, research, scans, reviews, doc sync. **Plan execution is metadata-gated, NEVER default-parallel** — fan-out follows ONLY what the plan declares (`PAR`/`SEQ` tags + per-phase write set); an untagged plan runs sequentially — why: a derived write set cannot see cascade or generated writes.
>
> 1. **Tag every task `PAR` or `SEQ`.** `PAR` = inputs exclude every pending task's output AND write set disjoint from every other `PAR`. Else `SEQ` — MUST ATTENTION name the dependency forcing it.
> 2. **Group `PAR` into waves.** No edge between members. Two writers of one file NEVER share a wave. Read-only work (search, investigation, review, research) parallelizes freely.
> 3. **Declare before dispatch:** `Parallel plan: wave 1 = [...] · wave 2 = [...] · SEQ = [...] (reason)`.
> 4. **Spawn each wave in ONE message** — every `Agent` call in one response, NEVER dripped per turn. Route each task to its specialist (`.claude/skills/shared/sub-agent-selection-guide.md`); NEVER `code-reviewer` as catch-all.
> 5. **Brief each sub-agent self-contained:** goal · scope + owned files · reference docs · return contract (summary + `Full report:` path, per SYNC:subagent-return-contract) · incremental persistence to `plans/reports/` (per SYNC:incremental-persistence).
> 6. **Barrier per wave.** Advance ONLY after EVERY member returns (a skipped conditional counts as returned). Merge, mark each task completed/skipped, THEN dispatch the next wave. Mutating steps wait for the barrier.
> 7. **One level deep.** A dispatched sub-agent executes its own brief; further fan-out stays the orchestrator's job unless that agent's `.claude/agents/*.md` definition authorizes it.
>
> **NEVER parallelize:** tasks sharing a write target · a task consuming a pending task's output · trivial single-file work (dispatch overhead > gain) · an order a skill or workflow explicitly fixes · gates awaiting user approval.
>
> **Blocked until:** MUST ATTENTION every task tagged PAR/SEQ with a named reason per SEQ · waves declared + write-set disjointness checked · each wave spawned in ONE message · barrier honored before the next wave.

## Closing Reminders

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION Goal:** Deliver a complete, evidence-backed, user-validated architecture decision report — every concern researched with 3+ options, every recommendation carrying confidence % + cited evidence, every decision confirmed by the user — so implementation proceeds on sound, owned architectural choices.

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION — Protocols in force (concise digest of the SYNC/shared blocks this skill carries):**

- **Critical Thinking:** traced `file:line` proof per claim, confidence >80% to act.
- **Sequential Thinking:** multi-step Thought N/M with REVISION/BRANCH/HYPOTHESIS, confidence closer.
- **AI Mistake Prevention:** verify generated content against evidence, trace downstream references, verify all affected outputs, re-read after context loss, surface ambiguity.

**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** execute ALL 12 main steps in order, tracking each — 1 Load Context (+mode) · 2 Derive Requirements (+workload profile/scaling ladder, reversibility ranking, ≤3 driving attributes + sacrifices, 6-part quantified scenarios, 2-2 pre-decision interrogation, cost) · 3A Backend Styles (+selection procedure, modulith-first, extraction triggers) · 3B Backend Patterns · **3C Data & Consistency** (stores/substrates, replication/failover, cache contract, one writer, consistency + staleness, transaction boundary, tenancy, partitioning, migrations, retention, RPO/RTO) · **3D Integration & APIs** (sync-vs-async + acceptance state, API/edge cache style, versioning, contracts, outbox/CDC, idempotency, event granularity, queue hygiene, resilience, degradation) · 4 Frontend · 4B UI System (skip if backend-only) · 5 Library Ecosystem · 6 Testing · 7 CI/CD (+release-safety rules) · 8 Observability (signal roles + sampling/cardinality) · 9 Code Quality (+Scaffold Handoff table) · 10 Dependency Risk · 11 Generate Report (+ADRs) · 12 User Validation — NEVER skip, reorder, or merge a step without explicit user approval — why: the model keeps forgetting its own steps and silently drops mandatory gates.
**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** rank every decision by REVERSIBILITY first — one-way doors (data model + keys, tenancy, consistency model per read path, sync-vs-async at a boundary, public API/event contract, service boundaries, auth model, residency + retention) get an ADR + a Step-12 validation question; two-way doors get a decision and momentum — why: an unreviewed irreversible decision surfaces months later as a migration, and that is this skill's most expensive failure mode.
**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** reason FROM `.claude/docs/architecture-knowledge.md` (laws, quality-attribute TACTICS §2, coupling taxonomy + four coupling dimensions, module-design principles §4, style-selection triggers, isolation levels + coordination primitives §8-§9, trade-off cheat sheet, ~100-entry anti-pattern catalog, symptom→cause triage, judgment checklists §20) — but the project's OWN reference docs and accepted ADRs OUTRANK it on any conflict — why: universal reasoning must not be mistaken for binding project convention.
**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** interrogate BEFORE deciding and self-audit BEFORE emitting: run the 15 pre-decision questions (§20.1) on every one-way door — including question 15, "what would make this the WRONG choice, and how would I detect it?", which becomes the ADR's revisit trigger — **DESIGN IT TWICE** (≥2 materially different candidates per one-way door), then run the 11 thinking red flags (§20.3) against your own draft. Prescribe the TACTIC (§2), never the product — why: a first-idea design with no rejected alternative and no named falsifier is a belief, and a recommendation whose sacrifice you cannot name fails its own audit.
**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** name the ISOLATION LEVEL on every critical write path and protect every check-then-act invariant explicitly (constraint · `FOR UPDATE` · Serializable + retry · atomic conditional write) — Read Committed AND snapshot isolation both permit write skew; and any distributed lock/leader election MUST name its **fencing token**, lease duration and expiry behaviour — why: both defects pass every single-user test and corrupt data only under the concurrency production supplies.
**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** simplicity is the default; every layer, service, extra data store and abstraction must be BOUGHT with a named, quantified quality attribute — modulith-first, and distribute ONLY against a measured extraction trigger (never "the codebase feels big", never "microservices are best practice") — why: distribution bought speculatively pays every distributed cost immediately and collects the benefit never.
**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** name at most 3 DRIVING quality attributes AND the attributes being SACRIFICED, with the trade-off stated as "we accepted cost C to buy property P" — a design that claims to maximize everything has decided nothing — why: unnamed sacrifices resurface as production surprises nobody agreed to.
**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** any write-then-publish flow gets a transactional outbox or CDC (never a dual write), every consumer and unsafe mutation is idempotent (exactly-once delivery is impossible), every outbound call has a timeout with capped jittered retries, and every queue is bounded with a monitored DLQ — why: these four are the load-bearing correctness requirements of any async system and their absence passes all functional tests.
**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** in a pooled multi-tenant model, isolation is enforced at the LOWEST layer (row-level security / ORM global filter / mandatory repository base) with tenant derived from the authenticated principal, plus a test asserting cross-tenant reads return zero rows — NEVER developer discipline, NEVER a client-supplied `tenant_id` — why: one missing tenant predicate or tenant-less cache key is a cross-tenant breach that passes every functional test.
**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** an architectural rule not automatically verified is a SUGGESTION and will be violated within a quarter — every machine-checkable ADR constraint MUST land in the Step-9 Scaffold Handoff as an executable fitness function, and existing debt is paid with a CI RATCHET, never a promised cleanup sprint — why: governance by review meeting loses to governance by executable check, every time.
**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** research min 3 options per architecture concern with cited web evidence (stars, last release, downloads, CVE scan) — NEVER recommend from familiarity alone — why: familiarity bias ships unmaintained or insecure dependencies.
**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** validate decisions with user via `AskUserQuestion` (Step 12) — NEVER auto-decide a hard-to-reverse choice — why: the user owns hard-to-reverse decisions; the architect proposes, the user confirms.
**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** quantify Step-2 quality-attribute scenarios (latency p95/p99, throughput, SLO, RPO/RTO, growth, concurrency) — any unknown target becomes an explicit `Unresolved question`, NEVER a silent guess — why: a style chosen without numbers is a guess, not an enforceable decision.
**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** profile workload before technology — read/write ratio, sustained/peak load, query shapes, growth, burst/hot-key skew, geography and staleness — then measure/tune → choose vertical and/or stateless horizontal from headroom + availability → read/write tactics → partition/shard LAST. NEVER recommend a distributed component without naming the measured bottleneck it removes and the trade-off it creates.
**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** brownfield: FIRST read project reference docs + accepted ADRs, constrain research to the existing stack, and NEVER re-litigate a settled ADR-recorded decision without a superseding-ADR rationale — why: re-deciding a recorded choice churns the codebase and breaks downstream conformance checks.
**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** search 3+ existing patterns/ADRs before proposing any new style or pattern; cite `file:line` (or URL/benchmark) evidence and a confidence % for EVERY claim — confidence >80% to recommend, <60% DO NOT recommend — why: speculation without proof is forbidden output.
**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** evaluate fit before copying a nearby pattern — closest example ≠ matching preconditions; verify the new context shares the same scale, constraints, and boundaries — why: a pattern lifted into a mismatched context fails silently.
**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** produce the two binding downstream contracts — one ADR per hard-to-reverse decision (`architecture-review` Cat 9 enforces) AND the Scaffold Handoff tool-choices table (`scaffold`/`harness-setup` consume) — a decision not written as an ADR or encoded as an executable fitness check cannot be enforced downstream — why: documented-but-unenforced budgets erode silently as code changes.
**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** break work into small todo tasks using `TaskCreate` BEFORE starting; mark one `in_progress`, mark `completed` immediately after evidence lands; add a final review todo — why: external task state survives context compaction; memory does not.

Judge which system-design techniques a system *warrants* at its scale — flag warranted-but-missing gaps AND advise AGAINST unwarranted heavyweight ones. **ADVICE-ONLY: emit the matrix as guidance; NEVER mutate any score, verdict band, or gate pass/fail.**
>
> 1. **Derive the scale tier FIRST — from evidence, never assumed.** Read users/RPS, SLO/latency targets, data volume, tenancy, topology from config/infra/specs; cite `file:line` + confidence. Tiers: `T0` internal/single-instance · `T1` small SaaS (<10k users) · `T2` high-scale (10k–1M) · `T3` massive/multi-region (millions+). Unknown tier → state assumption, do NOT default to T3.
> 2. **Judge each concern group only at/above its warranting tier** (member techniques → owning review skill for depth):
>    - Traffic & Edge — Rate Limiting, Load Balancing, Reverse Proxy, API Gateway, CDN, Edge Caching, WAF, DDoS (T1+; CDN/WAF T2+) → security-review owns WAF/DDoS
>    - Caching & Data Access — Caching, Cache Invalidation, DB Indexing, Query Optimization, N+1, Connection Pooling (T1+) → performance-review owns depth
>    - Data Scaling & Consistency — Read Replicas, Sharding, Partitioning, Replication, CAP, Eventual Consistency, Locks, Leader Election (T2+; sharding/multi-region T3) → performance-review
>    - Async & Messaging — Message Queues, Pub/Sub, Event-Driven, Saga, DLQ, Distributed Transactions, Backpressure, Webhooks, WebSockets/SSE (T2+)
>    - Resilience — Circuit Breakers, Timeouts, Retries, Backoff, Idempotency, Health Checks, Liveness/Readiness, Failover, Graceful Degradation (T1+) → production-readiness-review
>    - Scaling & Compute — Autoscaling, Horizontal/Vertical Scaling, Serverless Limits, Cold Starts, Cron Jobs, Thread Safety, GC/Memory Leaks (T1+; autoscaling T2+)
>    - Deployment & Release — CI/CD, Docker, Kubernetes, Blue-Green/Canary/Rolling, Rollbacks, Feature Flags, IaC/Terraform/Helm, Build Caching (CI/CD T0+; K8s/canary T2+)
>    - Observability — Monitoring, Logging, Distributed Tracing, Metrics, Alerting, SLOs/SLIs, Error Budgets (T1+; tracing/error-budgets T2+) → production-readiness-review
>    - Security & Compliance — Secrets Management, IAM, OAuth, JWT Rotation, TLS, Encryption at Rest/Transit, CORS, CSRF, SQLi, XSS, SSRF (T0+) → security-review owns
>    - DR & Infra — Backups, Disaster Recovery, Multi-Region, Chaos Engineering, Schema Versioning, DB Migrations, Cost Optimization (backups T1+; DR/multi-region/chaos T3) → production-readiness-review
> 3. **Assign one of 4 verdicts per warranted technique:** `PRESENT` · `MISSING-WARRANTED` (→ **advise only** — guidance, NOT a score/gate lever) · `N/A-by-scale` (below warranting tier) · `OVER-ENGINEERED` (present but unwarranted at this tier → advise AGAINST).
> 4. **Anti-over-engineering guard (first-class):** do NOT recommend K8s, sharding, multi-region, service mesh, event sourcing, or distributed transactions below their warranting tier. A correctly-lean small system is a PASS, never a gap.
> 5. **Output — Technique Applicability Matrix:** `technique | tier-warranted? | present? | verdict | advice | evidence (file:line/config/infra)`. Full grouped catalog + per-tier baseline → `.claude/docs/scale-technique-catalog.md`. Hosting reviews surface this matrix WITHOUT changing any `/20`, `/24`, verdict band, or PASS/FAIL (per user decision 2026-07-06). **Drift-guard: tier thresholds & per-technique warranting tiers are AUTHORITATIVE in `.claude/docs/scale-technique-catalog.md` — the inline tier summary above is a condensed pointer; on any tier/technique change, update the catalog FIRST, then re-run `.claude/scripts/inject_scale_technique_gate.py` to re-propagate this block.**
>
> **BLOCKED until:** `- [ ]` tier derived from evidence (not assumed) `- [ ]` matrix emitted `- [ ]` over-engineering guard applied `- [ ]` advisory-only (no score/verdict mutation) confirmed

**MUST ATTENTION** apply critical + sequential thinking — every claim needs appropriate traced evidence (`file:line` for repo/code claims; source URL or artifact section for research, product, content, and docs claims); confidence >80% to act, <60% DO NOT recommend. Anti-hallucination: never present guess as fact, admit uncertainty freely, cross-reference independently, stay skeptical of own confidence.

<!-- SYNC:sequential-thinking-protocol -->

> **Sequential Thinking Protocol** — Structured multi-step reasoning for complex/ambiguous work. Use when planning, reviewing, debugging, or refining ideas where one-shot reasoning is unsafe.
>
> **Trigger when:** complex problem decomposition · adaptive plans needing revision · analysis with course correction · unclear/emerging scope · multi-step solutions · hypothesis-driven debugging · cross-cutting trade-off evaluation.
>
> **Format (explicit mode — visible thought trail):**
>
> 1. `Thought N/M: [aspect]` — one aspect per thought, state assumptions/uncertainty
> 2. `Thought N/M [REVISION of Thought K]: ...` — when prior reasoning invalidated; state Original / Why revised / Impact
> 3. `Thought N/M [BRANCH A from Thought K]: ...` — explore alternative; converge with decision rationale
> 4. `Thought N/M [HYPOTHESIS]: ...` then `[VERIFICATION]: ...` — test before acting
> 5. `Thought N/N [FINAL]` — only when verified, all critical aspects addressed, confidence >80%
>
> **Mandatory closers:** Confidence % stated · Assumptions listed · Open questions surfaced · Next action concrete.
>
> **Stop conditions:** confidence <80% on any critical decision → escalate via AskUserQuestion · ≥3 revisions on same thought → re-frame the problem · branch count >3 → split into sub-task.
>
> **Implicit mode:** apply methodology internally without visible markers when adding markers would clutter the response (routine work where reasoning aids accuracy).
>
> **Deep-dive:** see `/sequential-thinking` skill (`.claude/skills/sequential-thinking/SKILL.md`) for worked examples (API design, debugging, architecture), advanced techniques (spiral refinement, hypothesis testing, convergence), and meta-strategies (uncertainty handling, revision cascades).

<!-- SYNC:ai-mistake-prevention -->

> **AI Mistake Prevention** — Failure modes to avoid on every task:
>
> **Re-read files after context changes.** Context compaction, resume, or long-running work can make memory stale; verify current files before acting.
> **Verify generated content against source evidence.** AI hallucinates APIs, names, claims, and document facts. Check the relevant source before documenting or referencing.
> **Check downstream references before deleting or renaming.** Removing an artifact can stale docs, generated mirrors, configs, and callers; map references first.
> **Trace the full impact chain after edits.** Changing a definition can miss derived outputs and consumers. Follow the affected chain before declaring done.
> **Verify ALL affected outputs, not just the first.** One green check is not all green checks; validate every output surface the change can affect.
> **Assume existing values are intentional — ask WHY before changing OR flagging one as a defect.** Before changing or reporting a constant, limit, flag, cutoff, wording, or pattern, read nearby context and history, the CALLER's ordering, and 2+ sibling call sites of the same convention. A doc stating WHAT without WHY is missing rationale, not proof of a missing guard.
> **Surface ambiguity before acting — don't pick silently.** Multiple valid interpretations require an explicit question or stated assumption with risk.
> **Assert the outcome your system owns, not the intermediate state your infrastructure owns.** When verifying async work, assert the final business state — never the delivery/retry bookkeeping held in shared infrastructure that any co-running process can write. Such a check passes when run alone and flakes the moment anything else shares that infrastructure.
> **Keep shared guidance role-relevant.** Universal guidance must help every receiving skill or agent; code-specific obligations belong only in code-specific protocols.

<!-- /SYNC:ai-mistake-prevention -->

**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** use `TaskCreate` to break ALL work into small tasks BEFORE starting.
**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** use `AskUserQuestion` at EVERY decision point — never assume user preferences.
**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** research top 3 options per architecture concern, compare with evidence, present report with recommendation + confidence %.

> **External Memory:** For complex or lengthy work (research, analysis, scan, review), write intermediate findings and final results to a report file in `plans/reports/` — prevents context loss and serves as deliverable.

> **Evidence Gate:** MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION — every claim, finding, and recommendation requires `file:line` proof or traced evidence with confidence percentage (>80% to act, <80% must verify first).

<!-- SYNC:sequential-thinking-protocol:reminder -->

**MUST ATTENTION** apply sequential-thinking — multi-step Thought N/M, REVISION/BRANCH/HYPOTHESIS markers, confidence % closer; see `/sequential-thinking` skill.

<!-- /SYNC:sequential-thinking-protocol:reminder -->

<!-- SYNC:ai-mistake-prevention:reminder -->

**MUST ATTENTION** apply AI mistake prevention — verify generated content against evidence, trace downstream references before deleting or renaming, verify all affected outputs, re-read files after context loss, and surface ambiguity before acting.

<!-- /SYNC:ai-mistake-prevention:reminder -->

**[TASK-PLANNING]** Before acting, analyze task scope and systematically break it into small todo tasks and sub-tasks using TaskCreate.

> **[IMPORTANT]** Analyze how big the task is and break it into many small todo tasks systematically before starting — this is very important.
