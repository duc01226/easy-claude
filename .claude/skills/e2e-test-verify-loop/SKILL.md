## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Drive a configured E2E suite or real-user journey to a truthful green result over a fixed scope. Resolve the project contract first, select an existing test or generate a traceable Given/When/Then test, bring up the whole system, use a visible browser for web human-QC, inspect runtime/visual evidence, adjudicate every failure, fix the owning layer, and re-run fresh until the declared scope converges or a bounded blocker is escalated.

**Default scope:** the whole discovered E2E scope — every configured E2E project and linked observable surface. A named feature, bugfix, spec, test project, or code change narrows the scope only when the prompt explicitly names it. Scope is recorded once and never shrinks silently.

**Workflow:** resolve scope and Goal Contract → read project-config/reference → resolve startup/readiness/auth/data/browser/evidence → select or generate tests → run and inspect → adjudicate failures → fix/review/re-run → require fresh consecutive green runs → report or escalate.

**Key rules:**

- `e2eTesting.execution` is optional, but missing capability is never a guessed default. Link `surfaceIds[]` to `experienceVerification.surfaces[]`; the linked `localRun` owns startup/readiness/log/teardown.
- For web human-QC, use the configured visible Playwright CLI path when supported. Wait on real readiness/actionability first; a deterministic 200–300ms post-action delay is presentation pacing only.
- Use project-owned auth and data paths. Never copy credentials, storage state, cookies, tokens, or seed values into prompts/reports; never bypass the UI with direct datastore mutation.
- Reuse a suitable existing test. Generate through `/e2e-test` → `e2e-runner` only when coverage is missing or the current test does not protect the requested invariant.
- A passing screen is not enough: runtime errors, uncaught exceptions, unhandled rejections, journey-critical failed requests, unread evidence, and baseline mismatches remain visible findings.
- Never delete, skip, narrow, weaken, retry-wrap an assertion, silence logs, or auto-promote a baseline to obtain green.

## Why this skill exists

E2E generation, local bring-up, browser evidence, and bounded failure repair otherwise live in separate skills. That separation makes it easy to run only a changed test, skip the missing auth/data setup, call a screen that looks correct despite a console error, or stop after one green run. This skill owns the convergence contract while delegating specialized work to the existing E2E, experience, debug, fix, and review skills.

## Step 0 — Resolve scope and Goal Contract

Before any test command or edit:

1. Read `docs/project-config.json`, `docs/project-reference/docs-index-reference.md`, `docs/project-reference/lessons.md`, `docs/project-reference/e2e-test-reference.md`, and the relevant feature/spec/code contract.
2. Resolve `{scope}`:

   | Prompt/context | Fixed scope |
   | --- | --- |
   | No target named | Every configured E2E project and every linked applicable observable surface |
   | Feature/bugfix/journey named | Tests and surfaces covering that behavior, with the mapping cited |
   | Spec/test project named | The configured project and any required linked surface |
   | Code diff/branch named | The E2E projects/surfaces affected by that explicit change set |

3. Record the scope as a stable list. If no runnable E2E framework exists, record `N/A — <config and scan evidence>` and do not substitute a generic browser runner. If a relevant surface exists but cannot run or be inspected, record `ENVIRONMENT-BLOCKED — <missing capability and evidence>`.
4. Create a Goal Contract whose required criterion is:

   > A fresh full E2E verification over the fixed scope reports zero failed scenarios across the configured consecutive-green requirement (default 2), with exact runner output, no scope shrink, no test deletion/skip/weakening, and no automatic baseline acceptance.

5. Record the round cap (default 3), expected consecutive-green count, and the executed/skipped scenario counts after the first run.

## Step 1 — Resolve the project execution contract

Read `e2eTesting` and, when present, `e2eTesting.execution` before selecting a
runner. Resolve each row and cite the source:

| Area | Required record | Block condition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Framework/project | config file, test root, page-object/fixture root, full and focused command | No runnable framework/command → `N/A` or `ENVIRONMENT-BLOCKED` |
| Surface/lifecycle | `surfaceIds[]` → `experienceVerification.surfaces[]` → `localRun` dependency/start/ready/log/teardown | Missing recipe or readiness signal → blocked |
| Auth | fixture/storage-state/registration/manual/none, reference only | Missing required account or safe path → blocked |
| Data | seed command, project-relative working directory, reference/idempotent/additive mode, cleanup policy | Missing or destructive/shared reset path → blocked |
| Browser | configured runner/engine, headed/visible setting, viewport/device/locale/network | Web human-QC without visible/configured path → blocked |
| Evidence | root, screenshot/console/request/trace/video kinds, redaction policy | Unredacted or unread evidence → not verified |
| Convergence | max attempts, consecutive-green requirement, settle timeout | Missing cap → use documented bounded default; never loop indefinitely |

Discovery order for a partial profile is: linked `localRun`, E2E reference and
runner config, package/task/compose/CI scripts, fixture/seed/auth docs, then a
bounded repository scan. Preserve known values and cite every derived value.
Never invent a port, account, selector, dependency install, command, or
storage-state value.

## Step 2 — Build the scenario and choose generate-or-use

For each requested behavior, write a scenario record before execution:

```text
GIVEN <verified actor, fixture/data, and starting state>
WHEN <real actions through the configured interface>
THEN <visible/persisted/business outcome plus relevant failure/recovery state>
INVARIANT <spec §8 rule, acceptance criterion, or source contract protected>
SETTLE <observable readiness/state signal after each meaningful action>
TC <existing TC code or a new traceable code proposed for the scenario>
```

Search for at least three comparable existing E2E tests/page objects when the
project has them. If a suitable test covers the same invariant and scope,
select it and do not generate a duplicate. If no suitable test exists, invoke
`/e2e-test` and the `e2e-runner` specialist to generate a Page Object/test in
the project’s local convention. A coverage gap feeds both the spec/intent
record and the test; never patch only the test to hide a missing rule.

## Step 3 — Bring up and exercise the whole system

For every `APPLICABLE` surface, in order:

1. Start only project-declared backing services through `localRun` or cited repository commands.
2. Run migrations/seed through supported project paths. Use unique run data, count-before-create/reference data, idempotent or additive setup, and current-run-only cleanup after evidence capture.
3. Start the surface and poll its declared readiness signal. A started process, open port, or fixed sleep is not readiness.
4. Attach server logs and browser console/page-error/request capture before the first interaction.
5. For web, open the configured browser visibly when human-QC is requested. Use semantic/accessible actions and stable locators. After readiness/actionability, apply the configured deterministic 200–300ms presentation delay when appropriate.
6. Drive the Given/When/Then path through the real interface. Capture screenshots for relevant states and trace/video/console/requests when configured; then read the artifacts and redact sensitive content.
7. Tear down only processes/services started by this run. Preserve accepted baselines and record candidate evidence separately.

If any precondition fails, preserve the logs and classify the branch
`ENVIRONMENT-BLOCKED`; do not disable auth, stub a dependency, skip a state, or
claim a pass.

## Step 4 — Run a bounded convergence round

Each round is a fresh full verification over the exact recorded scope:

1. Snapshot scope, test/scenario IDs, executed/passed/failed/skipped counts, and the working tree.
2. Run the configured full command; use the focused command only in addition to, never instead of, the declared full scope. Record command, exit status, counts, failing names, run identity, data mode, and evidence paths.
3. Invoke `/experience-review --rounds=0` report-only for configured observable surfaces. It may classify evidence and runtime/UI findings but must not fix, update baselines, or change expectations inside this loop.
4. If green, compare counts to the previous round. Require the configured consecutive-green runs without a reset; each must be fresh and same-scope.
5. If anything fails, record a provisional verdict before editing:

   - `SOURCE-WRONG` — production behavior violates the governing intent/spec.
   - `TEST-WRONG` — assertion/setup contradicts the governing intent.
   - `TEST-NOT-OPTIMAL` — valid test, but brittle/low-signal setup or selector needs repair without weakening the invariant.
   - `ENVIRONMENT-BLOCKED` — startup/auth/data/browser/evidence capability prevented a verdict.
   - `AMBIGUOUS` — evidence cannot distinguish the owner; stop and ask the owner.

6. For non-blocked failures, invoke `/debug-investigate` inline and trace end-to-start from observed failure to the invariant-owning layer. Then invoke `/fix` at that owning layer. Preserve the assertion that exposed the failure.
7. If the round changed files, invoke `/changes-review` inline, report-only, over the round’s fix diff. Resolve validated blocking findings before re-running. If no files changed, record the skip reason.
8. Run the Round Integrity Check: executed count must not decrease, skipped count must not increase, fixed scope must not narrow, runtime logs must not be hidden, and evidence collection must not be disabled.
9. Restart from a fresh bring-up/exercise. A green run before the fix does not count.

## Step 5 — Stop, escalate, and report honestly

Stop immediately on `ENVIRONMENT-BLOCKED`, `AMBIGUOUS`, missing secure auth,
unredacted evidence, a non-shrinking failure count across two rounds, rising
failures, a cap hit with failures open, scope shrink, test loss, a hidden log,
or an unaccepted baseline mismatch. Report the exact blocker and next human
decision; never convert it to a partial pass.

Convergence requires all of: fixed scope, exact runner output, zero failed
scenarios, required consecutive fresh green runs, Round Integrity Check pass,
and no open runtime-error/evidence/security finding. `HUMAN-ACCEPTED` remains
distinct from `AGENT-RECOMMENDED-ACCEPT`; current evidence never promotes a
baseline automatically.

## Required output

Persist a report containing:

- fixed scope and how it was resolved;
- Goal Contract and Given/When/Then + invariant records;
- config/reference evidence for framework, lifecycle, auth, data, browser, evidence, and convergence;
- existing-test reuse or generated test files and TC coverage;
- every command, run identity, exact Passed/Failed/Skipped counts, exit status, and fresh repeat evidence;
- runtime/visual evidence paths and redaction/read status;
- each failure’s single fault verdict, debug/fix/review references, and owning layer;
- Round Integrity Check results and final `CONVERGED`, `N/A`, `ENVIRONMENT-BLOCKED`, `NOT-CONVERGED`, or `ACCEPTANCE-PENDING` status.

## Anti-rationalization

| Temptation | Required response |
| --- | --- |
| Run only changed E2E files | Resolve and record the whole configured scope unless the prompt explicitly narrows it. |
| Generate a new test because it is convenient | Reuse a suitable existing invariant-protecting test and report the mapping. |
| Use a sleep because the page is slow | Poll readiness/actionability or a real settle signal; a 200–300ms delay is presentation only. |
| Copy a seeded password/storage state into the prompt | Use a configured reference and redact evidence; otherwise block. |
| Update a snapshot because the new output looks right | Preserve the old expectation and request explicit human acceptance. |
| Skip a failing environment or hide a console error | Record `ENVIRONMENT-BLOCKED` or a blocking runtime defect. |
| Fix the assertion first | Adjudicate and trace to the owner; keep the protected invariant intact. |

**Final reminder:** A green E2E result is meaningful only when the same declared
scope was exercised through the real interface, with exact output and readable
evidence, after every fix was adjudicated, reviewed, and re-run fresh.

> **Surface ambiguity before acting — don't pick silently.** Multiple valid interpretations require an explicit question or stated assumption with risk.
> **Assert the outcome your system owns, not the intermediate state your infrastructure owns.** When verifying async work, assert the final business state — never the delivery/retry bookkeeping held in shared infrastructure that any co-running process can write. Such a check passes when run alone and flakes the moment anything else shares that infrastructure.
> **Store disposable generated output in the project workspace.** If an output can be regenerated and is not source code, a canonical source-of-truth, or an intentionally versioned projection, write it under the project-root `tmp/` or `temp/` directory (prefer `tmp/`), scoped to the run. This includes temporary state, integration/E2E results, reports, logs, screenshots, traces, videos, coverage, dumps, and candidate evidence. Never put these outputs in source, docs, `plans/`, `team-artifacts/`, or mirror directories; the project-root `.gitignore` must ignore `/tmp/` and `/temp/` by default. Committed fixtures, accepted baselines, canonical specs/docs, and explicitly versioned generated mirrors remain at their declared owner paths.
> **Keep shared guidance role-relevant.** Universal guidance must help every receiving skill or agent; code-specific obligations belong only in code-specific protocols.
