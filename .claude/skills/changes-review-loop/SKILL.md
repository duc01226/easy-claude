## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Drive a diff scope to a **clean pass** by pairing `/changes-review` with `/fix` in a recursive loop — each round runs `/changes-review` INLINE in **report-only mode** to surface validated findings over a fixed diff scope, then `/fix` to resolve them at the owning layer, then loops again with a FRESH full `/changes-review` over the CHANGED diff — stopping when a complete `/changes-review` pass clears the round's exit bar: **zero validated findings** in rounds 1-2, and **zero validated CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM** from round 3 (LOW-only ENDS the loop, deferred not fixed).

**Summary:**

- **Each round = `/changes-review` (report-only) + validate + `/fix`** — the loop runs `/changes-review` as a review-PRODUCER that stops after its raw findings report (the documented `$workflow-review-changes` boundary: *"stop after the report; parent step 2 owns validation"*, `changes-review/SKILL.md:52,204`); the loop then owns the validation gate (`/why-review --validate-findings`) and the dedicated `/fix` half, so `/changes-review` never self-validates or self-fixes; one without the other never converges.
- **Steps (in order):** (0) resolve diff scope + Goal Contract → (0b) bind the convergence loop (protocol loop primary + optional `/goal` accelerator) → (1) round loop { run `/changes-review` report-only INLINE → `/why-review --validate-findings` on the report → run `/fix` on the VALIDATED findings at the owning layer → log iteration } → (2) converge when a fresh review clears the round's exit bar (zero findings rounds 1-2; zero CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM round 3+) OR escalate on non-progress → (3) terminal `/docs-update` + recap.
- **Convergence:** stop ONLY when a **fresh full** `/changes-review` over the CURRENT (post-fix) diff clears the round's exit bar — not a stale clean report predating the last fix.
- **Severity floor — from round 3, LOW stops blocking.** Rounds 1-2 converge on **zero validated findings** (any severity). **From round 3 the bar is zero validated CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM — a round whose validated findings are ALL LOW ENDS the loop.** Never open another round to fix LOW alone; list every deferred LOW in the recap and Goal Contract instead, and NEVER re-tier a real CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM down to LOW to reach the exit. Severity tiers per `SYNC:severity-rubric`.
- **Inline invariant:** run `/changes-review` and `/why-review` via the `Skill` tool, NEVER the `Agent` tool — they self-bind their OWN review-loop obligations (and a session `/goal` gate WHEN available, `changes-review/SKILL.md:197-223`, `why-review/SKILL.md:57-76`), which a sub-agent cannot own or carry back to this loop. `/changes-review`'s own dimensional reviewers (its Phase 0.7 sub-agents) stay sub-agents by its design, so context stays bounded.
- **Apply ONLY validated findings:** every finding is validated to the ≥85% survival bar via `/why-review --validate-findings` before `/fix` touches it; the loop applies THOSE at the lowest owning layer (Entity > Service > Handler), routed by change type — NEVER unvalidated findings.
- **Scope base is FIXED; the working tree grows.** Recompute the diff scope each round (`branch-diff base` ∪ current uncommitted changes) so convergence is measured against a stable subject as fixes accumulate.
- **Bounded:** round cap default 3; blocking findings not shrinking across 2 rounds, or cap hit with CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM still open → **STOP & escalate** via `AskUserQuestion`. Increasing findings → STOP (fixes regressing).

**Why this skill exists (READ FIRST — it is the whole justification):** standalone `/changes-review` COUPLES find + fix inside one skill invocation (its Phase 7 self-fix and Phase -1 self-recursive loop, `changes-review/SKILL.md:53,197-223`) — the review and the fix share one context, one lens, and one confirmation bias. This loop **decouples** them: it runs `/changes-review` purely as a finder (report-only, the documented `$workflow-review-changes` boundary where it stops after the report and the caller owns fixing, `changes-review/SKILL.md:29,204,558,578`), validates the findings, then hands them to a **dedicated `/fix`** half with its own intelligent routing at the lowest owning layer, and then re-runs a **fresh full** `/changes-review` over the changed diff. The value is the clean finder/fixer split plus the fresh-full re-review each round: it catches **fix-induced regressions** the coupled inner loop can rationalize away, and it lets `/fix` own the fix mechanics instead of the reviewer patching its own findings. Without this outer loop, "changes-review found issues, then something fixed them" ships those fixes without an independent fresh review.

**Workflow:** resolve diff scope + Goal Contract → bind the convergence loop (protocol loop + optional `/goal` accelerator) → **round loop** { run `/changes-review` report-only INLINE → `/why-review --validate-findings` → run `/fix` on the validated findings at owning layer → log iteration } → converge when a fresh full review clears the round's exit bar (zero validated findings rounds 1-2; zero validated CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM round 3+) → terminal `/docs-update` + recap.

**Key Rules:**

- **Each round pairs `/changes-review` (find) + `/fix` (resolve).** The loop runs `/changes-review` in report-only mode so it produces findings but does NOT self-validate or self-fix; the loop's `/why-review --validate-findings` gate and `/fix` are the halves that validate and land the change. A round is incomplete until BOTH have run (or the review returned zero findings).
- **MUST run INLINE in the main session — NEVER dispatch `/changes-review` or `/why-review` as a sub-agent.** They self-bind their own review-loop obligations (and a session `/goal` gate when available, `changes-review/SKILL.md:197-223`); as a sub-agent that in-session guarantee is silently lost. This loop skill therefore also runs inline. (`/changes-review`'s internal Phase 0.7 dimensional reviewers remain sub-agents by its own design — that is bounded and correct.)
- **Report-only invocation is mandatory.** Tell `/changes-review` to run as a review producer: do its full dimensional review + Phase 6 `/why-review --validate-findings` gate, then STOP before Phase 7 self-fix / Phase 7.5 holistic / Phase 8 docs-update. The loop owns fixing (Step 1.3) and the terminal docs-update (Step 3). If a `/changes-review` invocation cannot be constrained to report-only in this environment and self-fixes anyway, fall back to detecting fixes-applied per round (like `/workflow-review-changes-loop`) and skip the redundant `/fix` half for that round — never double-fix.
- **Convergence = a fresh full `/changes-review` over the post-fix diff clears the round's exit bar.** Rounds 1-2: zero validated findings. **Round 3+: zero validated CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM — LOW-only converges** (record the LOWs as deferred, do not fix them). A clean report produced BEFORE the latest fix landed does NOT count — re-review the changed diff.
- **The severity floor bounds ITERATION, never the standard.** It ends the loop; it never authorizes shipping a known CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM, never lowers the ≥85% finding-survival bar, and never applies to a binary gate (a failing test is a failure, not a LOW finding).
- **`/fix` applies ONLY validated findings**, at the lowest owning layer, routed by change type (code → `/fix` with its `--target` intelligent routing, or a direct edit at Entity/Service; spec-drift → `/spec [update]` + `/spec [mode=tests]`; docs → `/docs-update`; missing coverage → `/integration-test`; honor each finding's dual-feedback ledger, `changes-review/SKILL.md:530`). NEVER apply an unvalidated or demoted finding.
- **The diff scope base is FIXED across rounds; its content changes as fixes land.** Recompute `{scope}` = branch-diff base ∪ current uncommitted changes each round so the base merge-base never moves and convergence is measured against a stable subject.
- **Round cap (default 3)** and **blocking-findings-not-shrinking / increasing → STOP & escalate** via `AskUserQuestion`. NEVER loop open-ended. Cap exhaustion escalates only when CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM remain — a LOW-only round converges via the severity floor.

---

## First Principle — Convergence, Not Motion

> A round that changes the diff is progress **only if** the next fresh review finds fewer things to fix.
> The loop exists to reach a fixed point (no blocking findings), not to keep editing the code.
> The bar tightens by round: everything blocks in rounds 1-2; from round 3 only CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM block, so a LOW-only round is the fixed point.
> If findings stop shrinking, that is a signal to **escalate**, not to spin another round.

---

## Step 0 — Resolve Diff Scope + Goal Contract (FIRST ACTION)

1. **Parse the review scope** from the user prompt into a stable, reusable scope string — exactly the diff kinds `/changes-review` resolves (`changes-review/SKILL.md:96-104`). It has two parts UNIONed:
   - **Branch-diff base** — a branch-to-branch or PR diff (e.g. `git diff develop...HEAD`, three-dot: changes on the feature branch since it forked from `develop`) so the base is a **fixed merge-base**, not a moving target. If the prompt names a commit range, capture it the same way.
   - **Current changes** — the uncommitted working-tree changes (`git status --porcelain`, `git diff` + `git diff --staged`).
   - **Scope string (recompute each round):** `{branch-diff base} ∪ {current uncommitted changes}`. The base commit is fixed for the whole loop; the uncommitted set legitimately grows as fixes land.
   - If the prompt names no branch diff (pure "current changes" review), the scope is just the working-tree changes — the loop still applies. **NEVER silently convert the diff source type.**
2. **Resolve/create the Goal Contract** per `SYNC:goal-contract-satisfaction-loop` (`plans/goals/{YYMMDD-HHmm}-{slug}/goal.md`, template `.claude/templates/goal-contract-template.md`). Its single **required** Success Criterion:
   > *A fresh full `/changes-review` over `{scope}` clears the round's exit bar: **rounds 1-2** → **zero validated findings** (no finding of any severity survives the loop's `/why-review --validate-findings` gate); **round 3+** → **zero validated CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM findings**, with any remaining LOW findings recorded as deferred rather than fixed.*
   Record the round cap (default 3) and the scope string in **Constraints**.

## Step 0b — Bind the Convergence Loop (protocol-first; `/goal` is an optional accelerator)

The convergence loop is bound by TWO layers. The **protocol loop (Steps 1–2) is the BINDING mechanism** and MUST be self-driven by you, the running agent, on every host — with or without any command or hook. The **`/goal` command is an OPTIONAL accelerator** layered on top; it is never the primary mechanism, and its absence NEVER weakens the loop. This mirrors the project rule that hooks/trackers are accelerators only — correctness must not depend on them.

**1. Protocol loop — ALWAYS binding (hook/command-independent).** You are personally responsible for not stopping until the loop converges or bounded-escalates. This binds Claude, Codex, and Copilot equally, whether or not `/goal` exists:

> Repeatedly run `/changes-review` report-only INLINE over `{scope}` (recomputed each round). After each review, validate its findings with `/why-review --validate-findings`, apply every VALIDATED finding's fix via `/fix` at its owning layer, then re-run a FRESH full `/changes-review` over the CHANGED diff. Do NOT stop while the last review still produced validated findings that BLOCK at the current round's bar. Converge when a fresh full `/changes-review` clears that bar: **rounds 1-2** → zero validated findings; **round 3+** → zero validated CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM (LOW-only ENDS the loop, with the LOWs recorded as deferred). Cap at `{N=5}` rounds; if blocking findings do not shrink across 2 consecutive rounds, findings increase, or the cap is hit with CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM still open → STOP and escalate via `AskUserQuestion`. Never loop open-ended.

Treat this as a standing obligation you re-read at every Step 2 checkpoint — NOT a one-time note you can rationalize away after the first fix cycle. The Goal Contract's required Success Criterion (Step 0) is its durable, host-independent record.

**2. `/goal` command — invoke as an accelerator WHEN AVAILABLE.** If a `/goal` command exists and you are permitted to run it in this environment, ALSO invoke it (a real tool/command call, NOT a paraphrase, NOT a Goal Contract file substituted for it) with the SAME condition, so a session Stop hook mechanically enforces the loop:

```
/goal changes-review convergence loop: repeatedly run /changes-review report-only INLINE over {scope} (recomputed each round). After each review, validate its findings with /why-review --validate-findings, apply every VALIDATED finding's fix via /fix at its owning layer, then re-run a FRESH full /changes-review over the CHANGED diff. If blocking validated findings>0 → apply fixes and run another round; if a fresh full /changes-review clears the round's bar (rounds 1-2: zero validated findings; round 3+: zero validated CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM, LOW-only counts as clear with the LOWs recorded as deferred) → CONVERGED, run the terminal /docs-update and clear the gate. Do NOT stop while the last review still produced blocking validated findings. Cap at {N=5} rounds; if blocking findings do not shrink across 2 consecutive rounds, findings increase, or the cap is hit with CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM still open → STOP and escalate via AskUserQuestion. Never loop open-ended.
```

The `/goal` Stop hook blocks stopping until the condition holds and auto-clears when met — do not tell the user to clear it.

**If `/goal` is unavailable, unregistered, or not permitted** (e.g. Codex/Copilot, or a Claude run without the command): DO NOT error, DO NOT block, and DO NOT invent a stand-in gate. Record ONE line in the Goal Contract — `/goal accelerator unavailable — loop bound by protocol (Steps 1–2) + this Goal Contract` — and proceed. The protocol loop above plus the Goal Contract are the same gate, enforced by discipline instead of a hook.

> **Nested gates (by design, safe):** each inner `/changes-review` round would self-bind its OWN Phase -1 review-loop obligation — but the loop runs it in **report-only mode**, where Phase -1 is deferred to the caller (the `$workflow-review-changes` boundary, `changes-review/SKILL.md:204`), so no inner self-fix gate is installed; THIS outer loop owns the single convergence gate. Each inner `/why-review --validate-findings` self-clears when that round's findings are all adjudicated. All self-clear on satisfaction — no orphaned gate. Do NOT tell the user to clear either.

## Step 1 — Round Loop (`/changes-review` → validate → `/fix` → log)

Each round couples the two halves — **review to find, fix to resolve.** For each round `R` (starting at 1), do ALL of:

1. **Snapshot before:** record the working-tree fingerprint — `git status --porcelain` + `git diff --stat`. This is the fixes-applied baseline for the round and the objective backstop for convergence detection (Step 2).
2. **Run `/changes-review` report-only INLINE** on the recomputed `{scope}` via the `Skill` tool (NEVER the `Agent` tool). Direct it to run as a review PRODUCER: perform its full dimensional review and STOP after writing its findings report — do NOT run its Phase 6 validation, Phase 7 self-fix, Phase 7.5 holistic, or Phase 8 docs-update. This is exactly the `$workflow-review-changes` boundary where the caller (this loop) owns validation and fixing, so `/changes-review` hands the raw report back and stops (`changes-review/SKILL.md:52,204,558,578`). If the environment cannot constrain `/changes-review` to report-only and it self-fixes anyway, treat that self-fix as this round's fix half (detect fixes-applied vs the before-snapshot) and skip Steps 1.3–1.4 to avoid double-fixing.
3. **Validate the findings — THE LOOP OWNS THIS GATE.** Run `/why-review --validate-findings <report-path>` INLINE via the `Skill` tool over the report `/changes-review` just produced (`plans/reports/code-review-*.md`), so every finding is confirmed correct, proof-backed, reasonable, and best-practice (≥85% survival bar) before any fix. This is the parent-owned validation the report-only boundary defers to the caller (`changes-review/SKILL.md:52`). If the validated finding set is empty → this round converged; go to Step 2 (no fix half needed).
4. **Run `/fix` on the validated findings** (findings>0 only) — this is the half the loop owns. Resolve each validated finding at its owning layer: code → `/fix` (its `--target` intelligent routing) or a direct edit at the lowest layer (Entity > Service > Handler); spec-drift (CODE-WRONG/SPEC-STALE/SPEC-SILENT) → route per the finding's Spec Drift Adjudication verdict (`/spec [update]` + `/spec [mode=tests]`); missing coverage (GAP/SPEC-GAP) → `/integration-test`; docs → defer to the terminal `/docs-update`; behavior-changing → honor the finding's Dual-Feedback Ledger (spec verdict + test action, `changes-review/SKILL.md:530`). Fix ONLY validated findings — never an unvalidated or demoted one.
5. **Append an Iteration Log entry** to the Goal Contract: round number, validated findings count, files/artifacts changed this round (`file:line`), fixes applied, and remaining gaps.

## Step 2 — Convergence & Escalation Gate

Evaluate after every round:

| Condition | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Fresh full `/changes-review` returned **zero validated findings** AND the working tree is unchanged by that final review pass | **CONVERGED** → mark the required criterion PASS in the Goal Satisfaction matrix → clear the `/goal` gate → go to Step 3. |
| Validated findings > 0 AND round `< N` AND findings shrank vs prior round | Apply the validated fixes (Step 1.4), recompute `{scope}`, then run round `R+1` (fresh full re-review of the changed diff). |
| Findings did **not shrink** across 2 consecutive rounds (same/increasing count) | **STOP & escalate** via `AskUserQuestion` — a non-converging loop is a signal, not a reason to spin. |
| Round `R ≥ 3` AND the fresh review's validated findings are **ALL LOW** (zero CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM) | **CONVERGED on the severity floor** → do NOT run another round for LOW alone → record every remaining LOW as a deferred finding in the recap + Goal Contract → mark the required criterion PASS → go to Step 3. |
| Round cap `N` hit with CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM still open | **STOP & escalate** via `AskUserQuestion` — report the still-open findings; do not silently continue. (LOW-only at the cap converges via the severity-floor row above.) |

> **Increasing findings = STOP.** If round `R` surfaces MORE validated findings than round `R-1`, the fixes are regressing the code — STOP and escalate immediately (mirrors `changes-review/SKILL.md`'s regression stance). Never trade one fix for two new findings across rounds.

## Step 3 — Terminal Docs-Update + Recap

1. **Terminal `/docs-update` (MANDATORY once converged).** The loop ran `/changes-review` in report-only mode, so its unconditional Phase 8 docs-update (`changes-review/SKILL.md:55,68`) was deferred to the caller. Once a fresh full `/changes-review` clears the round's exit bar (zero validated findings, or zero validated CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM from round 3), invoke `/docs-update` INLINE over the full changeset as the terminal step so no stale docs survive.
2. **Recap.** Emit a concise convergence recap: rounds run, validated findings per round (the shrinking sequence), the fixes applied at each round, the final zero-findings evidence, and the Goal Satisfaction matrix (required criterion PASS). Point to each round's `/changes-review` report under `plans/reports/` and the Goal Contract Iteration Log. Do NOT commit or push unless the user explicitly asks.

---

## Convergence Detection — Why a Fresh Full Re-Review Is Required

A round converges ONLY when a `/changes-review` that ran over the **current, post-fix** diff clears the round's exit bar — zero validated findings in rounds 1-2, zero validated CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM from round 3. Both properties are required because:

- **Fresh over the changed diff** — a clean report from a review that predates the last fix proves nothing about the fix. Every applied fix invalidates the prior verdict (`changes-review/SKILL.md:72`); the loop MUST re-review after fixing, never reuse a stale clean report.
- **Zero *validated* findings** — the loop's `/why-review --validate-findings` gate already dropped inflated/unproven findings below the ≥85% bar; convergence rides on that validated set, so the loop never chases a nit the review itself would demote.
- **Working-tree unchanged backstop** — the objective `git`-diff comparison (Step 1.1 snapshot) confirms the converging review actually landed no fix; a "clean" verdict that still mutated files means the round DID fix things → run another round to re-prove clean.

When validated findings remain but cannot be fixed (owner/product input needed) → **escalate**, do not loop. When a fix lands but the next fresh review still finds issues → run another round. Convergence is a fixed point, not a single clean read.

---

**IMPORTANT MANDATORY sequence:** Step 0 (resolve diff scope + Goal Contract) → Step 0b (bind the convergence loop: protocol loop primary + optional `/goal` accelerator) → Step 1 (round loop: run `/changes-review` report-only INLINE → `/why-review --validate-findings` → run `/fix` on validated findings → log) → Step 2 (converge on a zero-findings fresh review / escalate on non-progress) → Step 3 (terminal `/docs-update` + recap).

**MUST ATTENTION** apply AI mistake prevention — verify generated content against evidence, trace downstream references before deleting or renaming, verify all affected outputs, re-read files after context loss, and surface ambiguity before acting.

- **MANDATORY MUST ATTENTION ALWAYS ASK THE 3 TRADE-OFF QUESTIONS** — on the thing under review AND on every recommendation you make: (1) **is there any trade-off?** name what it SACRIFICES (change cost · complexity · perf · coupling · reversibility · migration · ops load · blast radius · security · testability · delivery time · UX) — "none"/"pure win" is an unfinished analysis, so state the dimensions checked; (2) **is it worth it?** gain (with a metric) vs cost, WHO pays, WHEN → emit **WORTH IT / NOT WORTH IT / UNCLEAR**; NOT WORTH IT → withdraw or replace it; (3) **is it material enough to confirm with the user?** irreversible/one-way door · cost shifted onto another team/ops/maintainer/user · one quality attribute traded for another · a tier/service/event/library boundary crossed · auth/money/data-integrity/breaking-change/High-or-Medium-risk path · verdict UNCLEAR → **STOP and confirm via `AskUserQuestion` BEFORE the verdict**.
- **MANDATORY** A MATERIAL trade-off with no user confirmation can NEVER be PASS; NEVER bury one as a Low-severity note, NEVER decide it silently, and NEVER let delivery or convergence pressure authorize a one-way door. — why: an un-walked-back one-way door is the user's call to make, not the reviewer's.
- **MANDATORY — non-asking contexts escalate BY HANDOFF, never by silence.** `AskUserQuestion` reaches only the main interactive agent: a sub-agent cannot ask the user, and a terminal/verdict-only mode asks nothing by design. There the duty is REDIRECTED, not waived — still name the trade-off, still decide materiality, record `confirmed? = NO — cannot ask from this context`, **state the unconfirmed MATERIAL trade-off in your RETURNED verdict/summary so the CALLER escalates it** (a note only in an on-disk report is not a handoff), and never emit an unqualified PASS. Applies ONLY where the user is genuinely unreachable (spawned sub-agent, terminal validate mode, headless run) — if you CAN ask, you MUST ask.

## Closing Reminders

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION Goal:** Pair `/changes-review` + `/fix` in a recursive loop over a fixed diff scope — `/changes-review` (report-only) to find validated findings → `/fix` to resolve them → fresh full re-review of the CHANGED diff — until a complete `/changes-review` pass clears the round's exit bar — **zero validated findings** in rounds 1-2, **zero validated CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM** from round 3 (LOW-only ENDS the loop, deferred not fixed).

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION main steps (in order):** (0) resolve diff scope + Goal Contract → (0b) bind the convergence loop (protocol loop primary + optional `/goal` accelerator) → (1) round loop: run `/changes-review` report-only INLINE → `/why-review --validate-findings` → run `/fix` on VALIDATED findings at owning layer → append Iteration Log → (2) converge on a zero-findings fresh review / escalate on non-progress → (3) terminal `/docs-update` + recap.

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION [BLOCKING] plan the detailed todo tasks FIRST — before running the loop.** Before the first round, create a detailed todo-task plan that enumerates every planned step and every planned round; a round MUST NOT start until that round's fresh todo-task plan exists. On EVERY re-run (each new round), REGENERATE a fresh loop todo-task plan — NEVER reuse the prior round's task list — so each round's work is explicitly planned before it executes.

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** each round pairs `/changes-review` (find) + `/fix` (resolve); the loop runs `/changes-review` in report-only mode (`changes-review/SKILL.md:29,204`) so it never self-fixes, and the loop MUST run the `/fix` half — one without the other never converges.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** the convergence loop is bound by the **AI-driven protocol loop (Steps 1–2) — that is the primary, host-independent mechanism you MUST self-drive whether or not any command exists.** The `/goal` command is an OPTIONAL accelerator: invoke it (a real call) ONLY when available and permitted; if it is absent/unregistered/not-permitted, record one line in the Goal Contract and proceed — NEVER error, block, or fake a gate. Correctness must not depend on `/goal`.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** run `/changes-review` and `/why-review` **INLINE via the `Skill` tool — NEVER as a sub-agent** (they self-bind their own review-loop obligations + a session `/goal` gate when available, `changes-review/SKILL.md:197-223`). `/changes-review`'s internal Phase 0.7 dimensional reviewers remain sub-agents by its own design.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** convergence = a **fresh full** `/changes-review` over the **post-fix** diff clears the round's exit bar — **zero validated findings** in rounds 1-2, **zero validated CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM** from round 3 (LOW-only ENDS the loop) — (with the working-tree-unchanged backstop) — never a stale clean report predating the last fix.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** apply **ONLY validated findings** (≥85% survival bar via `/why-review --validate-findings`) at the lowest owning layer (Entity > Service > Handler); NEVER apply an unvalidated or demoted finding.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** keep the diff **base fixed** across rounds; recompute `{scope}` = branch-diff base ∪ current uncommitted changes each round.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** enforce the **round cap (default 3)**; findings not shrinking across 2 rounds, increasing, or cap hit with findings still open → **STOP & escalate** via `AskUserQuestion`. NEVER loop open-ended.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** run the terminal `/docs-update` once the loop converges (deferred from `/changes-review`'s report-only run); do NOT commit or push unless the user explicitly asks.
