## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Run comprehensive UI tests on a website and generate a detailed visual report.

> **For individual page/component testing with Playwright scripts, use `webapp-testing` instead.**

**Workflow:**

1. **Discover** — Browse target URL, discover all pages, components, endpoints
2. **Plan Tests** — Create test plan covering accessibility, responsiveness, performance, security, SEO. Responsiveness MUST verify the small-screen minimum bar at ~320px: the UI stays usable with **nothing broken** — no clipped, cut-off, or unreachable content/controls. A block that scrolls (`overflow: auto`) instead of reflowing is acceptable, NOT a failure; a block that clips content or hides a control off-screen with no scroll path is a failure.
3. **Execute** — Run parallel tester subagents; capture screenshots for each test area
4. **Analyze** — Use visual analysis tooling to review screenshots and visual elements
5. **Report** — Generate Markdown report with embedded screenshots and recommendations

**Key Rules:**

- Test and report only — never implement fixes (this is a testing/reporting skill)
- Save all screenshots in the report directory
- Support authenticated routes via cookie/token/localStorage injection

**Be skeptical. Apply critical thinking, sequential thinking. Every claim needs traced proof, confidence percentages (Idea should be more than 80%).**

**Pre-read (design system):** Load `designSystem.canonicalDoc` + `tokenFiles` from `docs/project-config.json` so visual/style assertions reference real token names (`--brand-*`, `$brand-*`) instead of guesses.

Activate the browser automation tooling.

## Purpose

Run comprehensive UI tests on a website and generate a detailed report.

## Arguments

- $1: URL - The URL of the website to test
- $2: OPTIONS - Optional test configuration (e.g., --headless, --mobile, --auth)

## Testing Protected Routes (Authentication)

For testing protected routes that require authentication, follow this workflow:

### Step 1: User Manual Login

Instruct the user to:

1. Open the target site in their browser
2. Log in manually with their credentials
3. Open browser DevTools (F12) → Application tab → Cookies/Storage

### Step 2: Extract Auth Credentials

Ask the user to provide one of:

- **Cookies**: Copy cookie values (name, value, domain)
- **Access Token**: Copy JWT/Bearer token from localStorage or cookies
- **Session Storage**: Copy relevant session keys

### Step 3: Inject Authentication

Use the available browser automation runner to inject credentials before testing:

```bash
# Cookies
# Add cookies before navigating to protected pages.

# Bearer token
# Set the Authorization header or localStorage token key before navigation.

# Local/session storage
# Populate the required storage keys, then reload the page.
```

### Step 4: Run Tests

After auth injection, the browser session persists. Run tests normally with the available browser automation runner:

```bash
# Navigate and screenshot protected pages.
# Save outputs in the report directory for later analysis.
```

### Auth Script Options

- `--cookies '<json>'` - Inject cookies (JSON array)
- `--token '<token>'` - Inject Bearer token
- `--token-key '<key>'` - localStorage key for token (default: access_token)
- `--header '<name>'` - Set HTTP header with token (e.g., Authorization)
- `--local-storage '<json>'` - Inject localStorage items
- `--session-storage '<json>'` - Inject sessionStorage items
- `--reload true` - Reload page after injection
- `--clear true` - Clear saved auth session

## Workflow

- Use `plan` skill to organize the test plan & report in the current project directory.
- All the screenshots should be saved in the same report directory.
- Browse $URL with the specified $OPTIONS, discover all pages, components, and endpoints.
- Create a test plan based on the discovered structure
- Use multiple `tester` subagents or tool calls in parallel to test all pages, forms, navigation, user flows, accessibility, functionalities, usability, responsive layouts, cross-browser compatibility, performance, security, seo, etc.
- Use `visual analysis tooling` to analyze all screenshots and visual elements.
- Generate a comprehensive report in Markdown format, embedding all screenshots directly in the report.
- Finally respond to the user with a concise summary of findings and recommendations.
- Use `AskUserQuestion` tool to ask if user wants to preview the report with `/preview` slash command.

## UI/UX Design Principles — Runtime-Observable Pass

The 40 clauses of `SYNC:ui-ux-design-principles` (full body inlined below in this skill) apply here in the **REVIEW** role, restricted to what a LIVE BROWSER SESSION can observe. Run them as **NINE focused passes — one dimension at a time against the running site**, never one simultaneous sweep across all nine. Answer each `Think:` prompt from first principles, then drive the browser to prove or disprove it.

**Out of scope for this skill — say so plainly in the report, never guess.** Clauses judgeable only by reading SOURCE or the DESIGN-TOKEN system belong to `/ui-review` and are routed there, not answered from a screenshot: `UI-1.2` (signal order), `UI-2.1` (family/weight inventory), `UI-2.5` (fixed 6-step type scale), `UI-3.2` (one accent, one job), `UI-4.1`-`UI-4.3` (base spacing unit, `gap`-vs-margin ownership, inner-vs-outer padding), `UI-6.3` (user's vocabulary vs internal naming), `UI-7.1` (does each field still need to exist).

**Evidence per finding:** `UI-<clause>` + the runtime locator (URL/route · viewport size · screenshot path) + the MEASURED value wherever the clause names one (computed contrast ratio, hit-box px, layout shift, response ms, characters per line, animation ms), plus `file:line` whenever the audit can identify the owning source. A clause carrying a number is satisfied only by a measured number — NEVER by "looks fine".

**Severity:** this skill defines no tier vocabulary and this pass introduces none — record findings in the existing report structure (key findings + recommendations), ordered by user impact. When this audit feeds `/ui-review`, that skill's BLOCKED / WARN / PASS rubric governs the merge decision.

| #   | Dimension (runtime-observable clauses)                                | `Think:`                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| --- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Visual hierarchy & state coverage — `UI-1.1`, `UI-1.3`-`UI-1.5`     | On first paint, which element does the eye land on, and is it the one the page exists for? Are groups separated by whitespace or by borders? Drive each surface to EMPTY, LOADING and ERROR — what renders? |
| 2   | Typography as rendered — `UI-2.2`-`UI-2.4`                           | Measure the computed body size (16px web, 17px mobile, never below 14px), the characters per line at each tested width (45-75), and the line-height ratio (1.5 body, 1.1-1.2 display).                     |
| 3   | Colour & contrast as rendered — `UI-3.1`, `UI-3.3`, `UI-3.4`         | Compute the ratio for every rendered text and UI-edge pair (4.5:1 / 3:1) — measured, never judged from the screenshot by eye. Is any status conveyed by colour alone? Toggle dark mode: lifted surfaces or an inversion? |
| 4   | Responsive breakpoints — `UI-4.4`                                    | At each tested width, where does the layout stop working, and does the breakpoint sit there or at a device name? _(The ~320px minimum bar in the test plan still decides pass/fail; `UI-4.4` adds WHERE the break belongs.)_ |
| 5   | Interaction & feedback — `UI-5.1`-`UI-5.5`                           | Press each control: what changes within 100ms? Walk all 5 states (default/hover/focus/active/disabled) — which is unstyled? Tab through: is the focus ring visible? Time the transitions (150-250ms, ease-out) and re-run with reduced-motion enabled. Is a confirmation used where undo would do? |
| 6   | Navigation & IA — `UI-6.1`, `UI-6.2`, `UI-6.4`                       | Landing cold on each route: where am I, what's here, where next? Count the top-level destinations (max 5). Deep-link the state and press back — does it land somewhere sensible?                          |
| 7   | Forms & input — `UI-7.2`-`UI-7.5`                                    | Fill each field: does the label stay visible? Does validation fire on blur with a message saying how to fix it? Does the mobile keyboard/autocomplete match the data type? Trigger an error, navigate away, refresh — does the typed data survive? |
| 8   | Mobile & touch — `UI-8.1`-`UI-8.4`                                   | At a touch viewport, measure each target's hit box (not the icon) and neighbour spacing (>=44x44pt, 8px apart). Where do primary actions sit relative to the thumb? Is anything gesture-only? Open the keyboard and check safe areas. _(No touch viewport in the matrix → skip with the reason stated.)_ |
| 9   | Speed & perceived speed — `UI-9.1`-`UI-9.4`                          | Throttle the connection: is structure shown before data (skeleton vs spinner), does anything shift as it lands, and is an optimistic update rolled back VISIBLY on failure? Go offline and force a timeout — designed state or hang? |

**Precedence:** the project design-system docs pre-read above (`designSystem.canonicalDoc` + `tokenFiles`) **OUTRANK** these clauses; a genuine conflict is reported with BOTH sides and taken to the user — NEVER resolved silently. Skip a dimension only when the site exposes no surface it can apply to, and state the skip with its reason.

## Output Requirements

How to write reports:

- Format: Use clear, structured Markdown with headers, lists, and code blocks where appropriate
- Include the test results summary, key findings, and screenshot references
- **IMPORTANT:** Ensure token efficiency while maintaining high quality.
- **IMPORTANT:** Sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision when writing reports.
- **IMPORTANT:** In reports, list any unresolved questions at the end, if any.

**IMPORTANT**: Stop at testing and reporting — do not start implementing the fixes.
**IMPORTANT:** Analyze the skills catalog and activate the skills that are needed for the task during the process.

---

> **[IMPORTANT]** Use `TaskCreate` to break ALL work into small tasks BEFORE starting — including tasks for each file read. This prevents context loss from long files. For simple tasks, AI MUST ATTENTION ask user whether to skip.

- `docs/project-reference/domain-entities-reference.md` — Domain entity catalog, relationships, cross-service sync (read when task involves business entities/models)

<!-- SYNC:test-failure-fault-adjudication -->

> **Test-Failure Fault Adjudication** — When a test fails (or you are debugging or fixing a failure), the job is to determine *who is at fault — the source code or the test code*. Getting that verdict right matters more than turning the suite green. Binds every debug / fix / test skill identically.
>
> 1. **Provisional verdict before touching either side.** Classify the observed evidence as SOURCE-WRONG, TEST-WRONG, TEST-NOT-OPTIMAL, ENVIRONMENT-BLOCKED, or AMBIGUOUS; then `/debug-investigate` and trace end-to-start before editing. A green-again suite is NOT the goal.
> 2. **Triangulate against the spec AND the source.** If a governing Feature Spec covers the behavior (e.g. `docs/specs/**` — §3 ACs / §4 BRs / §5 invariants / §8 TCs), it is the tiebreaker for *intended* behavior — compare BOTH the production source and the failing test against it. With no spec, the documented intent / acceptance criteria / caller contract is the reference. Decide from this evidence whether the SOURCE is wrong or the TEST is wrong.
> 3. **Classify who is at fault, then fix the wrong side at its root:**
>     - **SOURCE-WRONG** — production code violates the spec's intended behavior or a clear invariant → fix the source at the owning layer; keep or strengthen the test that caught it.
>     - **TEST-WRONG** — the test encodes a stale or incorrect assertion, setup, or expectation that contradicts intended behavior → fix the test at its root. NEVER weaken an assertion, add a skip, or relax a timeout to force green.
>     - **TEST-NOT-OPTIMAL** — intended behavior is valid but the test seam, timing, or assertion signal is fragile → improve the test without weakening the invariant.
>     - **ENVIRONMENT-BLOCKED** — infrastructure or external state prevents a source/test verdict → preserve diagnostics and stop mutation until the environment is healthy.
>     - **AMBIGUOUS** — evidence or intended behavior does not safely select an owner → ask the user or canonical owner before editing.
>     - NEVER change a test to match broken source, and NEVER change source to satisfy a broken test. (Migration code excluded — schema/data migrations are one-time execution paths, not core application logic.)
> 4. **Ask the user when intended behavior is unclear.** If no spec covers the behavior, the spec is silent, or the spec is ambiguous about which side is correct, STOP and `AskUserQuestion` (or consult the canonical spec owner) before editing either side — never silently pick source or test just to make the suite pass.
>
> Reconcile to intended behavior, never to whichever side currently passes — green can encode the very bug.

<!-- SYNC:ai-mistake-prevention -->

> **AI Mistake Prevention** — Failure modes to avoid on every task:
>
> **Re-read files after context changes.** Context compaction, resume, or long-running work can make memory stale; verify current files before acting.
> **Verify generated content against source evidence.** AI hallucinates APIs, names, claims, and document facts. Check the relevant source before documenting or referencing.
> **Check downstream references before deleting or renaming.** Removing an artifact can stale docs, generated mirrors, configs, and callers; map references first.
> **Trace the full impact chain after edits.** Changing a definition can miss derived outputs and consumers. Follow the affected chain before declaring done.
> **Verify ALL affected outputs, not just the first.** One green check is not all green checks; validate every output surface the change can affect.
> **Assume existing values are intentional — ask WHY before changing OR flagging one as a defect.** Before changing or reporting a constant, limit, flag, cutoff, wording, or pattern, read nearby context and history, the CALLER's ordering, and 2+ sibling call sites of the same convention. A doc stating WHAT without WHY is missing rationale, not proof of a missing guard.
> **Surface ambiguity before acting — don't pick silently.** Multiple valid interpretations require an explicit question or stated assumption with risk.
> **Assert the outcome your system owns, not the intermediate state your infrastructure owns.** When verifying async work, assert the final business state — never the delivery/retry bookkeeping held in shared infrastructure that any co-running process can write. Such a check passes when run alone and flakes the moment anything else shares that infrastructure.
> **Keep shared guidance role-relevant.** Universal guidance must help every receiving skill or agent; code-specific obligations belong only in code-specific protocols.

>
> **1.0 Visual Hierarchy & Layout**
>
> - `UI-1.1` One focal point per screen. Two elements competing for first read → demote one.
> - `UI-1.2` Signal order: size → weight → colour → position. Use the cheapest signal that works before adding another.
> - `UI-1.3` Group by proximity, NEVER by border. Whitespace separates cleanly; boxes inside boxes do not.
> - `UI-1.4` Align to a shared edge. Every unexplained indent reads as an accident.
> - `UI-1.5` Design the empty, loading and error state FIRST. The full state is the easy one.
>
> **2.0 Typography**
>
> - `UI-2.1` Max 2 families, 3 weights each. More variety reads as inconsistency, not range.
> - `UI-2.2` Body text 16px web, 17px mobile. NEVER below 14px for anything a user must read.
> - `UI-2.3` Line length 45–75 characters. Constrain the measure, not the container.
> - `UI-2.4` Leading scales inversely with size: 1.5 body, 1.1–1.2 display.
> - `UI-2.5` Fixed type scale — 6 named steps shared with engineering. NEVER one-off sizes.
>
> **3.0 Colour & Contrast**
>
> - `UI-3.1` Contrast 4.5:1 text, 3:1 UI edges. Measure it — NEVER judge by eye on a bright screen.
> - `UI-3.2` One accent, one job. An accent that is everywhere points at nothing.
> - `UI-3.3` Colour NEVER carries meaning alone — pair it with an icon, label or position.
> - `UI-3.4` Dark mode is NOT inverted light mode. Lift surfaces to signal elevation; soften pure-white text.
>
> **4.0 Spacing & Grid**
>
> - `UI-4.1` One spacing unit, multiplied — 4px or 8px base; every gap a multiple of it.
> - `UI-4.2` Space belongs to the container, not the child. Use `gap`; reserve margins for exceptions.
> - `UI-4.3` Tighter inside, looser between — inner padding always smaller than the gap to the next group.
> - `UI-4.4` Breakpoints follow content, not devices. Break where the layout stops working.
>
> **5.0 Interaction & Feedback**
>
> - `UI-5.1` Every action gets a response under 100ms, even when the result takes longer.
> - `UI-5.2` Specify all 5 states — default, hover, focus, active, disabled — plus loading where it applies.
> - `UI-5.3` Prefer undo over confirmation. Confirm ONLY what cannot be reversed.
> - `UI-5.4` Motion clarifies cause and effect: 150–250ms, ease-out, honours reduced-motion.
> - `UI-5.5` Keep the visible focus ring. Restyle it if it clashes; NEVER remove it.
>
> **6.0 Navigation & IA**
>
> - `UI-6.1` Every screen answers: where am I, what's here, where next.
> - `UI-6.2` Max 5 top-level destinations. Depth beats a crowded first level.
> - `UI-6.3` Label by the user's word, not the internal one. Team vocabulary is not a taxonomy.
> - `UI-6.4` Every state deserves a URL or a back path. Deep links and hardware back must land somewhere sensible.
>
> **7.0 Forms & Input**
>
> - `UI-7.1` Ask for less. Every field needs a reason it exists today.
> - `UI-7.2` Labels stay visible. Placeholders are hints, NEVER labels.
> - `UI-7.3` Validate on blur, not on keystroke. Errors sit next to the field and say how to fix it.
> - `UI-7.4` Match keyboard to data type — correct input type, autocomplete and autocapitalise on every field.
> - `UI-7.5` NEVER lose entered data. Preserve input across errors, navigation and refresh.
>
> **8.0 Mobile & Touch** _(mobile/touch surfaces)_
>
> - `UI-8.1` Hit target ≥44×44pt, 8px apart. The target may exceed the visible icon.
> - `UI-8.2` Primary actions in the bottom third — that is where the thumb lives.
> - `UI-8.3` Gestures are shortcuts, NEVER the only route. Anything swipeable is also tappable.
> - `UI-8.4` Respect safe areas and the keyboard. Notch, home indicator and on-screen keyboard all steal space.
>
> **9.0 Speed & Perceived Speed**
>
> - `UI-9.1` Show structure before data — skeletons for known layouts, spinners only for unknown waits.
> - `UI-9.2` Assume success optimistically. Update UI first, reconcile after, roll back visibly on failure.
> - `UI-9.3` Reserve space for anything that loads. Images, ads and fonts must NEVER shift the layout.
> - `UI-9.4` Design for the slow connection. Offline, timeout and retry are states, NOT edge cases.
