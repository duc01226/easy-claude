## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Drive a review target to a **clean zero-findings pass** by pairing `/why-review` with `/fix` in a recursive loop — each round runs `/why-review` INLINE to surface validated findings, then `/fix` to resolve them, then loops again over the CHANGED target — stopping only when a complete `/why-review` pass produces **zero findings** (nothing left to fix).

**Summary:**

- **Each round = `/why-review` + `/fix`** — `/why-review` is review-ONLY and never edits the target, so the loop MUST pair it with a fix half; one without the other never converges.
- **Steps (in order):** (0) resolve target + Goal Contract → (0b) bind the convergence loop (protocol loop primary + optional `/goal` accelerator) → (1) round loop { run `/why-review` INLINE → run `/fix` on the VALIDATED findings at the owning layer → log iteration } → (2) converge on a zero-findings round OR escalate on non-progress → (3) recap.
- **Convergence:** stop ONLY when a **fresh full** `/why-review` over the CURRENT (post-fix) target returns a PASS verdict with an **empty validated-finding set** — not a stale PASS predating the last fix.
- **Inline invariant:** run `/why-review` via the `Skill` tool, NEVER the `Agent` tool — it self-binds its OWN review-loop obligation (and a session `/goal` gate WHEN available, `why-review/SKILL.md:57-76`), which a sub-agent cannot own or carry back to this loop.
- **Apply ONLY validated findings:** `/why-review` already validates its findings to the ≥85% survival bar; the loop applies THOSE, at the lowest owning layer (Entity > Service > Handler), routed by target type — NEVER unvalidated findings.
- **Bounded:** round cap default 5; findings not shrinking across 2 rounds, or cap hit with findings still open → **STOP & escalate** via `AskUserQuestion`. Increasing findings → STOP (fixes regressing).

**Why this skill exists (READ FIRST — it is the whole justification):** `/why-review` is **review-only** — `why-review/SKILL.md:330` (*"Review only — do NOT modify target files or implement changes"*) and `:76` (*"why-review fixes its OWN findings set, not code… Code/spec/test fixes remain the caller's job"*). Its internal self-recursive `/goal` loop (`why-review/SKILL.md:57-76`) converges its own **findings REPORT** to CLEAN — every surviving finding proof-backed, validated, ≥85% confidence — but it **never touches the code and never re-reviews a fixed target**. So a finding that demands a code/spec/doc change is validated and handed off, yet **nothing loops back to confirm the FIX is correct or that it introduced no new defect**. This skill closes that outer loop: it applies the validated fixes and re-runs a **fresh full** `/why-review` over the changed target until zero findings remain — catching fix-induced regressions and proving each fix actually resolved its finding. Without it, "why-review passed, then I fixed the findings" ships those fixes unreviewed.

**Workflow:** resolve target + Goal Contract → bind the convergence loop (protocol loop + optional `/goal` accelerator) → **round loop** { run `/why-review` INLINE → run `/fix` on the validated findings at owning layer → log iteration } → converge when a fresh full review yields zero findings → recap.

**Key Rules:**

- **Each round pairs `/why-review` (find) + `/fix` (resolve).** `/why-review` is review-only (`why-review/SKILL.md:76,330`) — it produces validated findings but never edits the target; `/fix` is the half that lands the change. A round is incomplete until BOTH have run (or the review returned zero findings).
- **MUST run INLINE in the main session — NEVER dispatch `/why-review` as a sub-agent.** It self-binds its own review-loop obligation (and a session `/goal` gate when available, `why-review/SKILL.md:57-76`); as a sub-agent that in-session guarantee is silently lost. This loop skill therefore also runs inline.
- **Convergence = a fresh full `/why-review` over the post-fix target returns PASS with an empty validated-finding set.** A PASS produced BEFORE the latest fix landed does NOT count — re-review the changed target.
- **`/fix` applies ONLY validated findings**, at the lowest owning layer, routed by target type (code → `/fix` with its intelligent routing, or a direct edit at Entity/Service; plan/PBI → `/refine`; spec → `/spec [update]` + `/spec [mode=tests]`; docs → `/docs-update`; tests → `/integration-test`). NEVER apply an unvalidated or demoted finding.
- **The target base is FIXED across rounds; its content changes as fixes land.** Re-review the SAME target (same plan/diff/artifact) each round so convergence is measured against a stable subject.
- **Round cap (default 5)** and **findings-not-shrinking / increasing → STOP & escalate** via `AskUserQuestion`. NEVER loop open-ended.

## First Principle — Convergence, Not Motion

> A round that changes the target is progress **only if** the next fresh review finds fewer things to fix.
> The loop exists to reach a fixed point (zero findings), not to keep editing the target.
> If findings stop shrinking, that is a signal to **escalate**, not to spin another round.

---

## Step 0 — Resolve Target + Goal Contract (FIRST ACTION)

1. **Parse the review target** from the user prompt into a stable, reusable target reference — exactly the kinds `/why-review` resolves (`why-review/SKILL.md:142-161`):
   - **Plan / PBI / story** — a `plan.md` + `phase-*.md` dir, or a named PBI/story artifact.
   - **Code change** — a commit SHA, PR/merge commit, branch-to-branch or PR diff (e.g. `git diff develop...HEAD`), or uncommitted working-tree changes.
   - **Docs / spec / report** — a target artifact path whose claims are checked against source evidence.
   - Record the target type, its evidence, and confidence. **NEVER silently convert target types** (`why-review/SKILL.md:160`).
2. **Resolve/create the Goal Contract** per `SYNC:goal-contract-satisfaction-loop` (`plans/goals/{YYMMDD-HHmm}-{slug}/goal.md`, template `.claude/templates/goal-contract-template.md`). Its single **required** Success Criterion:
   > *A fresh full `/why-review` over `{target}` returns a PASS verdict with **zero validated findings** (no finding, weakness, or missing item of any severity).*
   Record the round cap (default 5) and the target reference in **Constraints**.

## Step 0b — Bind the Convergence Loop (protocol-first; `/goal` is an optional accelerator)

The convergence loop is bound by TWO layers. The **protocol loop (Steps 1–2) is the BINDING mechanism** and MUST be self-driven by you, the running agent, on every host — with or without any command or hook. The **`/goal` command is an OPTIONAL accelerator** layered on top; it is never the primary mechanism, and its absence NEVER weakens the loop. This mirrors the project rule that hooks/trackers are accelerators only — correctness must not depend on them.

**1. Protocol loop — ALWAYS binding (hook/command-independent).** You are personally responsible for not stopping until the loop converges or bounded-escalates. This binds Claude, Codex, and Copilot equally, whether or not `/goal` exists:

> Repeatedly run `/why-review` INLINE over `{target}`. After each review, apply every VALIDATED finding's fix at its owning layer, then re-run a FRESH full `/why-review` over the CHANGED target. Do NOT stop while the last review still produced findings. Converge ONLY when a fresh full `/why-review` returns PASS with zero validated findings. Cap at `{N=5}` rounds; if findings do not shrink across 2 consecutive rounds, findings increase, or the cap is hit with findings still open → STOP and escalate via `AskUserQuestion`. Never loop open-ended.

Treat this as a standing obligation you re-read at every Step 2 checkpoint — NOT a one-time note you can rationalize away after the first fix cycle. The Goal Contract's required Success Criterion (Step 0) is its durable, host-independent record.

**2. `/goal` command — invoke as an accelerator WHEN AVAILABLE.** If a `/goal` command exists and you are permitted to run it in this environment, ALSO invoke it (a real tool/command call, NOT a paraphrase, NOT a Goal Contract file substituted for it) with the SAME condition, so a session Stop hook mechanically enforces the loop:

```
/goal why-review convergence loop: repeatedly run /why-review INLINE over {target}. After each review, apply every VALIDATED finding's fix at its owning layer, then re-run a FRESH full /why-review over the CHANGED target. If findings>0 → apply fixes and run another round; if a fresh full /why-review returns PASS with zero validated findings → CONVERGED, clear the gate. Do NOT stop while the last review still produced findings. Cap at {N=5} rounds; if findings do not shrink across 2 consecutive rounds, findings increase, or the cap is hit with findings still open → STOP and escalate via AskUserQuestion. Never loop open-ended.
```

The `/goal` Stop hook blocks stopping until the condition holds and auto-clears when met — do not tell the user to clear it.

**If `/goal` is unavailable, unregistered, or not permitted** (e.g. Codex/Copilot, or a Claude run without the command): DO NOT error, DO NOT block, and DO NOT invent a stand-in gate. Record ONE line in the Goal Contract — `/goal accelerator unavailable — loop bound by protocol (Steps 1–2) + this Goal Contract` — and proceed. The protocol loop above plus the Goal Contract are the same gate, enforced by discipline instead of a hook.

> **Nested gates (by design, safe):** each inner `/why-review` round self-binds its OWN review-loop obligation (and installs its own `/goal` gate WHEN available, `why-review/SKILL.md:57-76`) that clears when THAT round's findings are all validated CLEAN. This OUTER loop persists across rounds and **subsumes** the inner ones (a converged loop implies every inner round ended with validated findings). All self-clear on satisfaction — no orphaned gate. Do NOT tell the user to clear either.

## Step 1 — Round Loop (`/why-review` → `/fix` → log)

Each round couples the two halves — **review to find, fix to resolve.** For each round `R` (starting at 1), do ALL of:

1. **Run `/why-review` INLINE** on `{target}` via the `Skill` tool (NEVER the `Agent` tool). Let it run its full adversarial review + its own internal Findings Validation Gate, so the findings it returns are already **validated** (proof-backed, ≥85% survival bar).
2. **Read the validated finding set** from its report (`plans/reports/why-review-*.md`). If the verdict is PASS with **zero** findings → this round converged; go to Step 2 (no fix half needed).
3. **Run `/fix` on the validated findings** (findings>0 only) — this is the half `/why-review` never does. Resolve each validated finding at its owning layer: code → `/fix` (its `--target` intelligent routing) or a direct edit at the lowest layer (Entity > Service > Handler); plan/PBI → `/refine`; spec → `/spec [update]` + `/spec [mode=tests]`; docs → `/docs-update`; behavior-changing → honor the finding's dual-feedback (spec verdict + test action per `why-review/SKILL.md:360`). Fix ONLY validated findings — never an unvalidated or demoted one.
4. **Append an Iteration Log entry** to the Goal Contract: round number, findings count (validated), files/artifacts changed this round (`file:line`), fixes applied, and remaining gaps.

## Step 2 — Convergence & Escalation Gate

Evaluate after every round:

| Condition | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Fresh full `/why-review` returned **PASS with zero validated findings** | **CONVERGED** → mark the required criterion PASS in the Goal Satisfaction matrix → clear the `/goal` gate → go to Step 3. |
| Findings > 0 AND round `< N` AND findings shrank vs prior round | Apply the validated fixes (Step 1.3), then run round `R+1` (fresh full re-review of the changed target). |
| Findings did **not shrink** across 2 consecutive rounds (same/increasing count) | **STOP & escalate** via `AskUserQuestion` — a non-converging loop is a signal, not a reason to spin. |
| Round cap `N` hit with findings still open | **STOP & escalate** via `AskUserQuestion` — report the still-open findings; do not silently continue. |

> **Increasing findings = STOP.** If round `R` surfaces MORE findings than round `R-1`, the fixes are regressing the target — STOP and escalate immediately. Never trade one fix for two new findings across rounds.

## Step 3 — Recap

Emit a concise convergence recap: rounds run, validated findings per round (the shrinking sequence), the fixes applied at each round, the final zero-findings PASS evidence, and the Goal Satisfaction matrix (required criterion PASS). Point to each round's `/why-review` report under `plans/reports/` and the Goal Contract Iteration Log. Do NOT commit or push unless the user explicitly asks.

## Convergence Detection — Why a Fresh Full Re-Review Is Required

A round converges ONLY when a `/why-review` that ran over the **current, post-fix** target returns PASS with an empty validated-finding set. Both properties are required because:

- **Fresh over the changed target** — a PASS verdict from a review that predates the last fix proves nothing about the fix. Every applied fix invalidates the prior verdict (`why-review/SKILL.md:565`); the loop MUST re-review after fixing, never reuse a stale clean verdict.
- **Zero *validated* findings** — `/why-review`'s own gate already dropped inflated/unproven findings below the ≥85% bar (`why-review/SKILL.md:361`); convergence rides on that validated set, so the loop never chases a nit the review itself would demote.

When findings remain but cannot be fixed (owner/product input needed) → **escalate**, do not loop. When a fix lands but the next fresh review still finds issues → run another round. Convergence is a fixed point, not a single clean read.

---

**IMPORTANT MANDATORY sequence:** Step 0 (resolve target + Goal Contract) → Step 0b (bind the convergence loop: protocol loop primary + optional `/goal` accelerator) → Step 1 (round loop: run `/why-review` INLINE → run `/fix` on validated findings → log) → Step 2 (converge on a zero-findings fresh review / escalate on non-progress) → Step 3 (recap).

## Closing Reminders

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION Goal:** Pair `/why-review` + `/fix` in a recursive loop over a fixed target — review to find validated findings → `/fix` to resolve them → fresh full re-review of the CHANGED target — until a complete `/why-review` pass produces **zero findings** (nothing left to fix).

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION main steps (in order):** (0) resolve target + Goal Contract → (0b) bind the convergence loop (protocol loop primary + optional `/goal` accelerator) → (1) round loop: run `/why-review` INLINE → run `/fix` on VALIDATED findings at owning layer → append Iteration Log → (2) converge on a zero-findings fresh review / escalate on non-progress → (3) recap.

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION [BLOCKING] plan the detailed todo tasks FIRST — before running the loop.** Before the first round, create a detailed todo-task plan that enumerates every planned step and every planned round; a round MUST NOT start until that round's fresh todo-task plan exists. On EVERY re-run (each new round), REGENERATE a fresh loop todo-task plan — NEVER reuse the prior round's task list — so each round's work is explicitly planned before it executes.

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** each round pairs `/why-review` (find) + `/fix` (resolve); `/why-review` is review-only (`why-review/SKILL.md:76,330`) and never edits the target, so the loop MUST run the `/fix` half — one without the other never converges.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** the convergence loop is bound by the **AI-driven protocol loop (Steps 1–2) — that is the primary, host-independent mechanism you MUST self-drive whether or not any command exists.** The `/goal` command is an OPTIONAL accelerator: invoke it (a real call) ONLY when available and permitted; if it is absent/unregistered/not-permitted, record one line in the Goal Contract and proceed — NEVER error, block, or fake a gate. Correctness must not depend on `/goal`.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** run `/why-review` **INLINE via the `Skill` tool — NEVER as a sub-agent** (it self-binds its own review-loop obligation + a session `/goal` gate when available, `why-review/SKILL.md:57-76`).
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** convergence = a **fresh full** `/why-review` over the **post-fix** target returns PASS with an **empty validated-finding set** — never a stale clean verdict predating the last fix.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** apply **ONLY validated findings** (≥85% survival bar) at the lowest owning layer (Entity > Service > Handler); NEVER apply an unvalidated or demoted finding.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** enforce the **round cap (default 5)**; findings not shrinking across 2 rounds, increasing, or cap hit with findings still open → **STOP & escalate** via `AskUserQuestion`. NEVER loop open-ended.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** do NOT commit or push unless the user explicitly asks.
