## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Convert one or more canonical 8-section Feature Specs into a complete, sprint-ready PBI backlog.

**Summary:**

- **Main steps:** scout/index → applicability/domain/rationale → clarify/scenario → plan/review/validate → refine → PBI/story/challenge/DoR → mock-up/design-spec → prioritize → docs/presentation/handoff.

- Load and audit the canonical Feature Specs, then evaluate the shared `isLargeIdea` rule and apply the embedded decomposition contract or the explicit isolated-change branch before decomposition.
- Map every spec requirement, business rule, test case, domain impact, and dependency to tech-agnostic PBIs and vertically sliced stories.
- Review, challenge, validate readiness, prioritize across PBIs, synchronize docs, and produce the backlog plus stakeholder evidence.
- Every generated PBI MUST be one independently releasable actor-facing outcome with a complete entry-to-result journey; technical/foundation/migration/setup work is attached enabling work, never a standalone PBI.
- For UI PBIs, the mockup MUST be a navigable mock app containing every required page/view, navigation edge, common/domain/page component, applicable state, and full-flow demo; one isolated screen is a blocking failure.

**Canonical input:** `docs/specs/{Bucket}/README.{Feature}.md` (one tech-free 8-section Feature Spec per capability). There is no separate A-E engineering bundle — code is the technical source of truth.

**Primary outputs:**

- `team-artifacts/pbis/{date}-pbi-{slug}.md` for each generated PBI — each carries its rank/priority in frontmatter (written back by `/prioritize`).
- `team-artifacts/backlog/spec-to-pbi-{date}-backlog.md` with priority order and dependency graph.
- `team-artifacts/pbis/{slug}-mockup.html` for each UI PBI (header surfaces the PBI priority/rank).
- `team-artifacts/design-specs/{date}-designspec-{slug}.md` for each UI PBI.
- One standalone HTML stakeholder deck from `/feature-presentation` whose Scope & backlog slide surfaces each PBI's priority/rank.
- `plans/reports/spec-to-pbi-{date}-{bucket}.md` with coverage matrix and unresolved questions.

**Universal Rules:**

- MUST ATTENTION define success criteria before execution and loop until observable verification passes.
- MUST ATTENTION when creating/reviewing specs or tests, name `Business Intent / Invariant Guarded` or the protected business intent/invariant and ensure the test would fail if that intent breaks.
- **[BLOCKING] Tech-agnostic output:** PBI / backlog / report prose stays tech-agnostic per `docs/project-reference/spec-principles.md` §3 — no framework/product/language/design-pattern names; source paths and class names appear ONLY in evidence fields (`**Evidence**`, `[Source:]`), frontmatter, and Mermaid.
- **[BLOCKING] Inherit M1-M5/M7 + logical-ID carry:** See `.claude/skills/shared/sdd-artifact-contract.md` → "AI-SDD Mandates (M1-M7)" for BLOCKING criteria. Every generated PBI MUST satisfy M1-M5 and M7. **M7 — business-visibility:** a PBI is a business-tree artifact, so apply the demo test to each acceptance criterion's BODY — *"what would a stakeholder SEE change?"*; no answer → FAIL as TECHNICAL-ONLY. Every `Given` = a state a user could arrange; every `When` = an action a user could take; every `Then` = an outcome a user could see. FAIL a `When` that is an invocation (a handler runs, a consumer receives, a job fires, data syncs) or a `Then` asserting schema/type/nullability/call-count, and NEVER derive a PBI's AC count from an architecture inventory. Judge the BODY, never the title or ID. **M1 governs vocabulary; M7 governs subject matter — a technical AC in impeccably tech-free prose satisfies M1 while violating M7**, and that gap is the most common way business specs rot. Carry each requirement's logical ID (`FR-`/`BR-`) from the spec's requirement/rule statements into the PBI as the PRIMARY citation spine, keeping the spec's `[Source: namespace/service/id]` abstract-anchor evidence as the SECONDARY carrier (KEEP it). Generated acceptance criteria stay tech-agnostic and observable — one valid interpretation, named failure modes, no implementation details.
- **[BLOCKING] Decomposition scope chain:** read `.claude/skills/shared/product-roadmap-contract.md`. For a large spec, carry the complete `large_idea_decomposition` block (`outcome_slices`, `dependencies_order`, `non_goals`, `risks_evidence`, `deferred_work_owner`) through every generated PBI, story, mock-up, and the all-PBI presentation. For an isolated spec, omit the block and roadmap fields. An explicitly supplied roadmap is read-only context; only an explicit roadmap-deliverable request invokes the standalone writer.
- **[BLOCKING] Releasable PBI contract:** read `.claude/skills/shared/releasable-pbi-contract.md`. Every generated PBI must name an actor-facing outcome, complete the entry-to-result journey, and carry evidence. UI PBIs must carry the complete page/view, navigation, component, state, and mock-app flow surface. A blocked gate cannot advance by assumption.

## When to Use

- User wants to create all PBIs from an existing Feature Spec (or a bucket of them).
- User wants to split a very large Feature Spec into small sprint-ready PBIs.
- User wants a dependency-aware and priority-ranked backlog from `docs/specs/`.
- User wants shared/foundation tasks identified before feature PBIs.

## When Not to Use

- Raw product vision without any Feature Spec -> use `/workflow-idea-to-spec` (then chain back here for the backlog).
- One informal idea -> use `/workflow-idea-to-pbi`.
- Spec creation/update only -> use `/workflow-code-to-spec` (from code) or `/workflow-idea-to-spec` (from an idea).
- Implementation after PBIs are ready -> use `/workflow-feature` or `/workflow-big-feature`.

## Protocol

### 1. Activate

Run `/start-workflow workflow-spec-to-pbi` with the user's prompt as context.

### 2. Load Spec Context

Locate and read, per target capability:

- `docs/specs/{Bucket}/INDEX.md` — the bucket catalog (which capabilities exist)
- `docs/specs/{Bucket}/README.{Feature}.md` — the canonical 8-section Feature Spec. Each PBI is decomposed from its sections:
    - §1 Overview / §3 User Stories & Acceptance Criteria → PBI scope + acceptance criteria
    - §4 Business Rules (`BR-`) + §3 (`US-`/`AC-`) → logical-ID citation spine (M3)
    - §5 Domain Model (Mermaid ERD) → entity/aggregate impact for `## Domain Impact`
    - §6 Process Flows → vertical-slice story boundaries
    - §7 Permissions & Roles → access-control acceptance criteria
    - §8 Test Specifications (`TC-`) → expected TC categories per PBI

- `large_idea_decomposition` from the Feature Spec and its source evidence when the spec is large. If an explicit roadmap path is supplied, read it as context and verify its approval; do not create or update one. Run `$scenario` conditionally when slice risks require it.

If the spec path is missing or ambiguous, ask the user for the exact bucket / Feature Spec path before generating PBIs.

### 3. Freshness Gate

Run `/spec-index` in audit mode before PBI generation.

- If stale behavior is found, run/update the impacted spec sections before generating PBIs.
- If only structural/doc formatting is stale, record the risk and continue.
- If critical domain/API/business-rule sections are stale, stop and ask whether to update specs first.

### 4. Coverage Matrix

Create a matrix with one row per independently deliverable item:

| Spec Source      | Capability     | Feature/Operation | Domain Impact             | Shared Dependency | PBI Type                                      | Status  |
| ---------------- | -------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| `{Feature §sec}` | `{capability}` | `{feature}`       | entity/state/event/API/UI | yes/no            | releasable feature / enabling task / existing reference / out-of-scope | planned |

Every source feature/operation must map to exactly one of:

- Generated releasable PBI
- Enabling task attached to a releasable PBI (not a standalone PBI)
- Existing releasable PBI reference
- Explicit out-of-scope decision with reason

### 5. Large Spec Decomposition

Apply these scale rules before creating PBIs:

| Scope                      | Required Breakdown                                                    |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1-3 capabilities           | Process inline with one task per capability and feature group         |
| 4-10 capabilities          | Split by capability, then feature/operation group                     |
| 10+ capabilities           | Incremental capability-group batches with coverage matrix checkpoints |
| Any PBI > 8 story points   | Split with SPIDR until each PBI is <= 8 story points                  |
| Cross-cutting prerequisite | Attach enabling work to the dependent releasable PBI, or define a separate actor-facing releasable outcome; never emit a technical-only PBI |

### 6. Domain Analysis Gate

Run `/domain-analysis` when any spec item includes:

- New or changed entities, aggregates, value objects, or ownership boundaries
- State machines or lifecycle transitions
- Cross-service event ownership or synchronization
- Data migration or seed/test-data needs

Record domain findings in each affected PBI under `## Domain Impact`.

### 7. PBI Generation Loop

For each matrix row that needs a new PBI:

1. Run `/refine` to create the PBI artifact and pass its Releasable Outcome Gate.
2. Run `/artifact-review --type=pbi` and fail any technical-only, incomplete-journey, or missing UI-surface PBI.
3. Run `/story` to create vertical-slice stories.
4. Run `/artifact-review --type=story`.
5. Run `/pbi-challenge`.
6. Run `/dor-gate`.
7. Run `/pbi-mockup` only when UI is involved. The generated mockup MUST be a navigable multi-view mock app covering the full outcome flow, required components/states, and all stories; it MUST also surface the PBI's priority/rank (header badge) so the prototype carries the same priority info as the backlog.
8. Run `/design-spec` only when UI is involved (after `/pbi-mockup`) — mirrors `workflow-idea-to-pbi` so the spec→pbi half is step-for-step IDENTICAL.

> **Spec-hub coupling (§6 interaction surface ↔ UI artifacts):** for UI PBIs the `/pbi-mockup` and `/design-spec` produced here are NOT standalone artifacts — they are the deep companions of the existing canonical Feature Spec's **§6 interaction surface** (View Inventory / Navigation Map / Key UI States / per-story click-path) you decomposed in step 2. Both couple to §6: the §6 thin intent seeds them, and `design-spec` records its path in the spec's `design_spec:` frontmatter (the mockup in `mockup:`) so the spec stays the navigable hub: a reader goes spec → §6 thin intent → mockup + `design-spec` deep companions, and the three never drift. Keep deep visual fidelity (layout, tokens, pixel detail) in the mockup/`design-spec`, never in §6. See the `SYNC:ui-intent-layer` block below for the full rule — do not restate it here. Backend-only PBIs (no UI) → skip `/pbi-mockup` + `/design-spec` and state that reason.

Each PBI MUST include:

- Logical requirement IDs (`FR-`/`BR-`) carried from the spec as the primary citation spine (M3).
- Source spec references with `file:section` evidence (secondary, re-anchorable carrier — KEEP).
- GIVEN/WHEN/THEN acceptance criteria — tech-agnostic and observable (M1/M4).
- Story points and complexity.
- Dependencies table with `must-before`, `can-parallel`, `blocked-by`, or `independent`.
- Priority input data for `/prioritize`.
- Test specification needs, including expected TC categories.
- Domain impact and enabling-task/dependency references; shared/foundation work is never emitted as a standalone technical-only PBI.
- Releasable Outcome Gate evidence: actor, observable outcome, entry-to-result journey, visible/persisted truth, applicable access/failure/recovery behavior, and explicit non-goals.
- For UI: page/view inventory, navigation map, common/domain/page component inventory, applicable states, and full-flow mock-app evidence; backend-only: explicit no-UI reason.

### 8. Cross-PBI Prioritization

After all PBI loops finish, run `/prioritize` once across the full generated set. `/prioritize` is NON-OPTIONAL whenever PBIs were generated — a backlog without priority is incomplete.

The backlog artifact MUST include:

- Rank and recommended implementation order.
- Dependency graph and first-do/blocked/defer groups.
- Required enabling work is attached to and ordered with the releasable PBIs it enables; never emit a standalone technical/foundation/setup/migration PBI.
- RICE or MoSCoW rationale.
- DoR status per PBI.
- Remaining open questions.

**PRIORITY PROPAGATION (MANDATORY):** `/prioritize` MUST write the resulting rank/priority back into EACH PBI's frontmatter (`priority:` + numeric rank), not only into the standalone backlog file. Every generated PBI carries its own priority so downstream consumers (`/pbi-mockup`, `/feature-presentation`) can surface it without re-deriving the ranking.

### 8.5 Near-Final Documentation Synchronization

Run `/docs-update` after `/prioritize` and before `/workflow-end`.

Purpose:

- Sync generated PBIs/stories/backlog outputs back into the canonical Feature Specs where applicable.
- Sync Feature Spec §8 Test Specifications with the generated TC needs.
- Verify Feature Specs, derived bucket `INDEX.md`, and TDD/spec docs do not drift after PBI generation.
- Record skipped sub-phases explicitly when no impacted docs exist.

### 8.6 Stakeholder Presentation

Run `/feature-presentation` after `/docs-update` and before `/workflow-end` — mirrors `workflow-idea-to-pbi` so the spec→pbi half is step-for-step IDENTICAL.

The standalone HTML deck MUST:

- Synthesize the generated PBIs, stories, mockups, and design-specs into one stakeholder presentation.
- Surface each PBI's **priority/rank** in the Scope & backlog slide (ranked order + priority label per PBI card), reusing the priority written back into PBI frontmatter by `/prioritize` and the ranked backlog artifact.

### 9. Completion Criteria

Workflow can close only when:

- Every spec source item is represented in the coverage matrix.
- Every generated PBI has dependency and priority fields.
- `/prioritize` has run and written rank/priority back into EACH PBI's frontmatter (priority propagation), not just the standalone backlog.
- Every generated PBI passes the Releasable Outcome Gate; enabling/foundation work is attached to a releasable outcome and ordered before the behavior it enables, never emitted as a technical-only PBI.
- Domain-analysis findings are attached where domain changes are implied.
- The final backlog artifact ranks all PBIs and explains what to do first.
- `/docs-update` has run as the near-final sync gate, with Feature Specs (§8) and derived bucket indexes either updated or explicitly marked unchanged.
- The generated PBIs carry the complete decomposition block and stable slice/dependency IDs when the spec is large; scenario proof is mapped to the appropriate PBI/TC or recorded in `deferred_work_owner`. No separate roadmap artifact is required.
- `/feature-presentation` has run, producing one standalone HTML deck whose Scope & backlog slide surfaces each PBI's priority/rank.

**IMPORTANT MANDATORY Steps:** /scout -> /spec-index -> /domain-analysis -> /why-review -> /spec-clarify -> /scenario -> /plan -> /plan-review -> /plan-validate -> /why-review -> /refine -> /why-review -> /artifact-review --type=pbi -> /story -> /why-review -> /artifact-review --type=story -> /pbi-challenge -> /dor-gate -> /pbi-mockup -> /design-spec -> /prioritize -> /docs-update -> /feature-presentation -> /workflow-end -> /watzup

> **[BLOCKING]** Each selected step MUST invoke its Skill tool. `/scenario` is conditional: run it only when the selected decomposition/slice risks need adversarial replay, state, ownership, recovery, or evidence analysis; otherwise mark the step skipped with evidence and an explicit reason. Marking a selected workflow step completed without skill invocation is a workflow violation.

> **Verify generated content against source evidence.** AI hallucinates APIs, names, claims, and document facts. Check the relevant source before documenting or referencing.
> **Check downstream references before deleting or renaming.** Removing an artifact can stale docs, generated mirrors, configs, and callers; map references first.
> **Trace the full impact chain after edits.** Changing a definition can miss derived outputs and consumers. Follow the affected chain before declaring done.
> **Verify ALL affected outputs, not just the first.** One green check is not all green checks; validate every output surface the change can affect.
> **Assume existing values are intentional — ask WHY before changing OR flagging one as a defect.** Before changing or reporting a constant, limit, flag, cutoff, wording, or pattern, read nearby context and history, the CALLER's ordering, and 2+ sibling call sites of the same convention. A doc stating WHAT without WHY is missing rationale, not proof of a missing guard.
> **Surface ambiguity before acting — don't pick silently.** Multiple valid interpretations require an explicit question or stated assumption with risk.
> **Assert the outcome your system owns, not the intermediate state your infrastructure owns.** When verifying async work, assert the final business state — never the delivery/retry bookkeeping held in shared infrastructure that any co-running process can write. Such a check passes when run alone and flakes the moment anything else shares that infrastructure.

>
> 1. **View Inventory** — list each view/screen by its UX ROLE and purpose (e.g. "list of items", "item editor", "confirmation step") and what information it presents. Describe by role, never by an implementation name.
> 2. **Navigation Map** — how a user moves between views: entry points, transitions, and exits. Trace how this surface connects to neighboring features already in the system.
> 3. **Key observable UI States** — the distinct states a user can observe per view (empty, loading, populated, error, success, permission-denied, etc.) — described as what the user perceives, not how it is rendered.
> 4. **Per-story interaction flow** — for each user story, the step-by-step click/action path from intent to outcome, cross-referenced to the logical IDs the spec already owns (`US-`/`OP-`/`BR-`).
> 5. **Couple to the companion design artifact** — keep deep visual fidelity (layout, tokens, pixel detail) OUT of the spec; it lives in the linked `design-spec`/mockup. Record that companion's path in the spec frontmatter so the spec stays the navigable hub.
>
> **M1-clean (NON-NEGOTIABLE):** the prose names ZERO frameworks, routes/URLs, CSS, or component-class names — only roles, information, states, and flows. Technology detail belongs in the companion design artifact, never here.
>
> **Skip ONLY** when the feature is backend-only (no UI) — state that reason explicitly in the section.

## Closing Reminders

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION Goal:** Convert canonical Feature Specs into a complete, dependency-aware, prioritized PBI backlog where every generated PBI is an independently releasable actor-facing outcome, without inventing product scope and with every review, validation, and synchronization gate evidenced.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION Main steps:** scout/index → applicability/domain/rationale → clarify/scenario → plan/review/validate → refine → PBI/story/challenge/DoR → mock-up/design-spec → prioritize → docs/presentation/handoff; no default roadmap writer.

**Protocols in force (concise digest of the SYNC/shared blocks this skill carries):**

- **Nested Task Creation:** Expand child phases under workflow rows; link parent when nested.
- **Critical Thinking:** Apply critical/sequential thinking; trace every claim, confidence >80%.
- **AI Mistake Prevention:** verify generated content against evidence, trace downstream references, verify all affected outputs, re-read after context loss, surface ambiguity.
- **Incremental Persistence:** Append findings to report file per file; never hold in memory.
- **Subagent Return Contract:** Sub-agents return summary plus report path only, no transcripts.

- **MUST** use the canonical Feature Specs as input; do not invent unrelated opportunities.
- **MUST** decompose big Feature Specs into small PBIs before story generation.
- **MUST** include dependency, priority, domain impact, and shared-task details.
- **MUST** apply `.claude/skills/shared/releasable-pbi-contract.md`: no standalone technical/foundation/migration/setup PBI; enabling work belongs under a releasable outcome.
- **MUST**, for UI PBIs, carry the complete page/view inventory, navigation map, common/domain/page components, applicable states, and a navigable full-flow mock-app outcome; one isolated screen is a FAIL.
- **MUST** write artifacts incrementally after each capability/feature.
- **MUST** run `/prioritize` once at the end across all generated PBIs, and write the resulting rank/priority back into EACH PBI's frontmatter (priority propagation) — not only the standalone backlog.
- **MUST**, for UI PBIs, run `/pbi-mockup` then `/design-spec` (both UI-conditional) — mirrors `workflow-idea-to-pbi` so the spec→pbi half is step-for-step IDENTICAL.
- **MUST** surface each PBI's priority/rank in the `/pbi-mockup` generated files (header badge) and in the `/feature-presentation` deck (Scope & backlog slide).
- **MUST** run `/docs-update` after `/prioritize` and before `/workflow-end` to keep specs, feature docs, and TDD/spec docs synchronized.
- **MUST** run `/feature-presentation` after `/docs-update` and before `/workflow-end` to synthesize a single standalone stakeholder deck.
