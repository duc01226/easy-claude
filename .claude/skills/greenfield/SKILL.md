## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Guide greenfield project inception from raw idea to an approved, implementable project plan using a full waterfall process.

**Workflow (17 steps):**

1. **Discovery** (`/idea`) — Interview user about problem, vision, constraints, team skills, scale. **DO NOT ask about tech stack** — keep business-focused.
2. **Market Source Discovery** (`/web-research`) — WebSearch for competitors, market landscape, existing solutions. Source gathering, NOT the sized market.
3. **Deep Research** (`/deep-research`) — WebFetch top sources, extract key findings
4. **Market Analysis** (`/market-analysis`) — Size the market (TAM/SAM/SOM), competitor matrix, trends, SWOT, customer segments. **Produces the evidence step 5 consumes** — `/business-evaluation` MUST NOT re-derive market sizing. SKIP only when there is no commercial market to size (internal tool, migration, infrastructure-only); log the reason, and step 5 then marks its market figures N/A rather than inventing them.
5. **Business Evaluation** (`/business-evaluation`) — Viability assessment, risk matrix, value proposition
6. **Domain Analysis & ERD** (`/domain-analysis`) — Bounded contexts, aggregates, entities, ERD diagram, domain events. Validate every context boundary with user.
7. **Tech Stack Research** (`/tech-stack-research`) — Derive technical requirements from business + domain analysis. Research top 3 options per stack layer (backend, frontend, database, messaging, infra). Detailed pros/cons matrix, team-fit scoring, market analysis. Present comparison report for user to decide.
8. **Architecture Design** (`/architecture-design`) — Research and compare top 3 architecture styles (Clean, Hexagonal, Vertical Slice, etc.). Evaluate design patterns (CQRS, Repository, Mediator). Audit against SOLID, DRY, KISS, YAGNI. Validate scalability, maintainability, IoC, technical agnosticism. Present comparison with recommendation. **Harness output required:** produce a "Scaffold Handoff — Harness Plan" table in the architecture report: (a) feedforward guides to create (AGENTS.md sections, skill activation rules, pattern catalog), (b) computational feedback sensors to install (linter, formatter, pre-commit, CI), (c) inferential feedback sensors to configure (review skills, AI gates), and (d) a "Test Architecture & Execution Contract" matrix. Emit the matrix before `/plan` (step 9) completes, with one row for each potentially applicable Unit, Integration/System, and E2E tier: `APPLICABLE` only with runner/framework/configuration evidence; otherwise `N/A — <evidence>`; owner; test root; fixture/data strategy; copy-ready full and focused commands; zero-match behavior; CI gate; simple/Windows entry point; and unique run/data identity. Missing required fields block the implementation-plan handoff. This table feeds `/scaffold` → `/linter-setup` → `/harness-setup`.
9. **Implementation Plan** (`/plan`) — Create phased plan using confirmed tech stack + architecture + domain model
10. **Security Audit** (`/security-review`) — Review plan for OWASP Top 10, auth patterns, data protection concerns
11. **Performance Audit** (`/performance-review`) — Review plan for performance bottlenecks, scalability, query optimization
12. **Plan Review** (`/plan-review`) — Full plan review, risk assessment, approval
13. **Refine to PBI** (`/refine`) — Transform idea + reviewed plan into actionable PBI with acceptance criteria
14. **User Stories** (`/story`) — Break PBI into implementable user stories
15. **Plan Validation** (`/plan-validate`) — Interview user with critical questions to validate plan + stories
16. **Test Strategy** (`/spec [mode=tests]`) — Finalize the architecture contract matrix, test pyramid, frameworks, and spec outline; verify every `APPLICABLE` tier has evidence-backed full/focused commands and unique run/data identity, and record evidence-backed `N/A` for every non-applicable tier before implementation handoff.
17. **Workflow End** (`/workflow-end`) — Clean up, announce completion

**Key Rules:**

- PLANNING ONLY: never implement code
- Every stage saves artifacts to plan directory
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** every stage requires `AskUserQuestion` validation before proceeding
- Delegate architecture decisions to `solution-architect` agent
- Present 2-4 options for every major decision with confidence %
- **Business-First Protocol:** Tech stack is NEVER asked upfront. Business analysis (steps 1-5) + domain modeling (step 6) must complete first. Tech stack is derived from requirements through research and presented as a comparison report with options.
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** architecture design MUST produce a "Scaffold Handoff — Harness Plan" table covering: feedforward guides, computational sensors (`/linter-setup` handles install), and inferential sensors (`/harness-setup` configures). The scaffold + linter-setup + harness-setup triad are NON-SKIPPABLE infrastructure — code without a harness accumulates technical debt from day one.
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** architecture design MUST emit the Test Architecture & Execution Contract matrix before the first implementation plan completes; the workflow MUST block implementation handoff when an applicable tier lacks a copy-ready full command, focused command, zero-match behavior, or unique run/data identity, and MUST record evidence-backed `N/A` for non-applicable tiers.

## Entry Point

This skill is the explicit entry point for the `workflow-greenfield-init` workflow.

**When invoked:**

1. Activate the `workflow-greenfield-init` workflow via `/start-workflow workflow-greenfield-init`
2. The workflow handles step sequencing, task creation, and progress tracking
3. Each step delegates to the appropriate skill (idea, web-research, domain-analysis, tech-stack-research, etc.)
4. The `solution-architect` agent provides architecture guidance throughout

## When to Use

- Starting a brand-new project from scratch
- No existing codebase (empty project directory)
- Planning a new application before writing any code
- Want structured waterfall inception with user collaboration at every step

## When NOT to Use

- Existing codebase with code (use `/plan` or `/start-workflow workflow-feature` instead)
- Bug fixes, refactoring, or feature implementation
- Quick prototyping (use `/feature-implement` instead)

## Output

All artifacts saved to plan directory:

```
plans/{id}/
  research/
    discovery-interview.md
    market-research.md
    deep-research.md
    market-analysis.md
    business-evaluation.md
    domain-analysis.md
    tech-stack-comparison.md
    architecture-design.md
  phase-01-domain-model.md
  phase-02-tech-stack.md
  phase-02b-architecture.md
  phase-03-project-structure.md
  phase-04-test-strategy.md
  phase-05-backlog.md
  plan.md (master plan with YAML frontmatter)
```

After completion, recommend next step: `/feature-implement` to scaffold the project structure.

**Be skeptical. Apply critical thinking, sequential thinking. Every claim needs traced proof, confidence percentages (Idea should be more than 80%).**

---

**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** break work into small todo tasks — one per workflow step.
**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** validate with user at EVERY step — never auto-decide.
**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** add a final review todo task to verify work quality and identify fixes/enhancements.

---

**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** use `TaskCreate` to break ALL work into small tasks BEFORE starting.
**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** use `AskUserQuestion` at EVERY stage — validate decisions before proceeding.
**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** NEVER ask tech stack upfront — business analysis and domain modeling first.

<!-- SYNC:ai-mistake-prevention -->

> **AI Mistake Prevention** — Failure modes to avoid on every task:
>
> **Re-read files after context changes.** Context compaction, resume, or long-running work can make memory stale; verify current files before acting.
> **Verify generated content against source evidence.** AI hallucinates APIs, names, claims, and document facts. Check the relevant source before documenting or referencing.
> **Check downstream references before deleting or renaming.** Removing an artifact can stale docs, generated mirrors, configs, and callers; map references first.
> **Trace the full impact chain after edits.** Changing a definition can miss derived outputs and consumers. Follow the affected chain before declaring done.
> **Verify ALL affected outputs, not just the first.** One green check is not all green checks; validate every output surface the change can affect.
> **Assume existing values are intentional — ask WHY before changing OR flagging one as a defect.** Before changing or reporting a constant, limit, flag, cutoff, wording, or pattern, read nearby context and history, the CALLER's ordering, and 2+ sibling call sites of the same convention. A doc stating WHAT without WHY is missing rationale, not proof of a missing guard.
> **Surface ambiguity before acting — don't pick silently.** Multiple valid interpretations require an explicit question or stated assumption with risk.
> **Assert the outcome your system owns, not the intermediate state your infrastructure owns.** When verifying async work, assert the final business state — never the delivery/retry bookkeeping held in shared infrastructure that any co-running process can write. Such a check passes when run alone and flakes the moment anything else shares that infrastructure.
> **Keep shared guidance role-relevant.** Universal guidance must help every receiving skill or agent; code-specific obligations belong only in code-specific protocols.

<!-- SYNC:critical-thinking-mindset -->

> **Critical Thinking Mindset** — Apply critical thinking, sequential thinking. Every claim needs traced proof, confidence >80% to act.
> **Anti-hallucination:** Never present guess as fact — cite sources for every claim, admit uncertainty freely, self-check output for errors, cross-reference independently, stay skeptical of own confidence — certainty without evidence root of all hallucination.

<!-- /SYNC:critical-thinking-mindset -->

<!-- SYNC:test-architecture-execution-contract -->

> **Test Architecture & Execution Contract** — Treat testability as a setup/architecture acceptance condition. For every potentially applicable tier — Unit, Integration/System, and E2E — record `APPLICABLE` only with evidence of its runner/framework/configuration; otherwise record `N/A — <evidence>` and never fabricate coverage.
>
> 1. **Matrix before implementation:** Record applicability, owner, runner/framework, test root, fixture/data strategy, full command, focused/partial command, zero-match behavior, CI gate, and a simple/Windows entry point (a `.cmd` when the project needs one).
> 2. **Runnable scopes:** Full and focused commands must be copy-ready, fail on invalid or zero-match selections, report exact counts and exit status, and be safe to repeat. E2E uses only configured browser/service commands.
> 3. **Fresh valid state:** Each run/test owns a unique run identity and business-data suffix, arranges through supported public paths, and uses realistic valid data. Reference setup is count-before-create, idempotent, and restart-safe. Intentional accumulation is additive, keyed, and integrity-checked; never hide contamination with destructive reset.
>    Run-scoped cleanup, when supported, is opt-in and idempotent: after evidence capture it may remove only ephemeral resources owned by the current run; it must never delete persistent/additive data or another run's data, reset shared state, or replace no-reset proof.
> 4. **Isolation and fidelity:** Isolate mutable roots and parallel workers; share only immutable/reference data. Preserve real actor pacing and observable arrange barriers. Do not widen retries or weaken assertions to make a scenario pass.
> 5. **Evidence gate:** Report command, scope, identity, seed/accumulation mode, exact result, and repeat proof. For each applicable persistent-state suite, require two consecutive no-reset full runs. Treat line coverage as diagnostic only; use meaningful property/invariant, mutation, change, and behavior coverage signals.
>
> **Ownership:** Architecture/harness defines the matrix; scaffold/workflow makes it runnable; test writers implement tier-specific cases; reviewers verify the contract; the runner reports; seed-data owners preserve uniqueness, idempotency, realism, and accumulation integrity. Missing required evidence blocks setup completion.

**MUST ATTENTION** apply critical + sequential thinking — every claim needs appropriate traced evidence (`file:line` for repo/code claims; source URL or artifact section for research, product, content, and docs claims); confidence >80% to act, <60% DO NOT recommend.

<!-- SYNC:project-protocol-overlay -->

> **Project Protocol Overlay** — Before executing this skill, resolve any PROJECT overlay rules layered onto it: match this skill's name against the `Target` column of the project's skill-protocol index (`docs/project-reference/skill-protocols-reference.md` by default; a `referenceDocs` entry in `docs/project-config.json` overrides the path), taking the most specific matching tier ONLY — exact name > glob > `*`. **That precedence orders overlays against EACH OTHER, never against this skill.** Read ONLY the matched bodies, resolved as `<protocols-dir>/<Name>.md`; a row's Body link is display text, never a read path. A matched body that is missing or malformed is REPORTED and skipped — never reconstructed from the index Description. No index, or no match -> proceed with no overlay, silently. Full contract: `.claude/skills/project-skill-protocol/references/registry.md`.
>
> Overlays are **ADDITIVE ONLY**: they ADD rules on top of this skill's own protocol and NEVER replace, override, disable, or reinterpret a rule it already states — removing every overlay must return this skill to exactly its documented behavior. An overlay is a BRIEF, not an authority escalation: it can NEVER waive a workflow gate, git discipline, a review gate, or a user-confirmation gate. A genuine overlay-vs-skill conflict, or two equally-specific overlays that directly contradict -> surface both to the user; NEVER resolve silently.

<!-- /SYNC:project-protocol-overlay -->

<!-- SYNC:project-protocol-overlay:reminder -->

**MUST ATTENTION** resolve project protocol overlays for this skill BEFORE executing — most specific matching tier only (exact > glob > `*`, which ranks overlays against each other, NEVER against this skill), read only matched bodies at `<protocols-dir>/<Name>.md`; a missing or malformed body is reported, never reconstructed. Overlays are ADDITIVE ONLY (they never replace this skill's own rules) and are a brief, NEVER an authority escalation; an equal-specificity contradiction goes to the user.

<!-- /SYNC:project-protocol-overlay:reminder -->

<!-- SYNC:test-architecture-execution-contract:reminder -->

**MUST ATTENTION** Before implementation, record evidence-backed Unit/Integration/System/E2E applicability (or explicit N/A), copy-ready full + focused commands, zero-match behavior, a simple/Windows entry point, unique run identity, realistic valid data, idempotent/restart-safe reference setup, intentional additive accumulation, parallel isolation, exact results, and two no-reset full runs for each applicable persistent-state suite.

## Closing Reminders

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** Protocols in force (concise digest of the SYNC/shared blocks this skill carries):

- **AI Mistake Prevention:** verify generated content against evidence, trace downstream references, verify all affected outputs, re-read after context loss, surface ambiguity.
- **Critical Thinking:** traced `file:line` proof per claim, confidence >80% to act, NEVER guess.

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** Test Architecture Handoff: emit the Unit/Integration/System/E2E contract matrix during architecture design before the implementation plan completes; missing applicable commands or run/data identity blocks handoff, and non-applicable tiers require evidence-backed `N/A`.

- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** break work into small todo tasks using `TaskCreate` BEFORE starting
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** search codebase for 3+ similar patterns before creating new code
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** cite `file:line` evidence for every claim (confidence >80% to act)
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** add a final review todo task to verify work quality

**[TASK-PLANNING]** Before acting, analyze task scope and systematically break it into small todo tasks and sub-tasks using TaskCreate.
