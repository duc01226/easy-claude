## Workflow Calls and Todo Bootstrap

Read [the registry](../../../.claude/workflows.json) → `workflows.workflow-integration-test` together with this skill. Call [`/start-workflow workflow-integration-test`](../start-workflow/SKILL.md) to resolve the selected mode, pre-actions and fingerprint.

**Todo FIRST:** create one todo for EVERY selected occurrence before triage, analysis or step execution, including conditional/optional ones; preserve occurrence IDs, roles and barrier groups. Use native todo tools or an equivalent persistent ledger. Then mark the first todo `in_progress`; attach evidence before `completed`.
Mode selection and registry loading prepare tracking; any 'first action' below means the first substantive action after this bootstrap.

**Call each step skill:** read its linked SKILL.md and execute its protocol through the active host with the registry args. Reading or naming a skill alone is not execution. Required gates and core/optional flex follow the linked start-workflow Step Execution Protocol; keep this skill's quality gates, loops and evidence requirements.

**Conditions:** load each occurrence's registry `applicability.when` and `skipReason` verbatim, and record its run/skip evidence through the linked start-workflow protocol. Do not silently omit a todo or turn a conditional skill into an unconditional call. Declared parallel groups retain their all-return barrier.

Explicit step-skill calls by mode (registry order; roles and conditions remain owned by the registry):

- Mode `write`: [`/investigate`](../investigate/SKILL.md) (core) → [`/spec [mode=tests]`](../spec/SKILL.md) (optional; conditional) → [`/work-item --mode=review --type=spec-tests`](../work-item/SKILL.md) (optional; conditional) → [`/integration-test`](../integration-test/SKILL.md) (core) → [`/integration-test --mode=review`](../integration-test/SKILL.md) (gate) → [`/integration-test --mode=verify`](../integration-test/SKILL.md) (gate) → [`/spec [mode=sync]`](../spec/SKILL.md) (gate) → [`/docs-manager --mode=update`](../docs-manager/SKILL.md) (optional; conditional) → [`/workflow-end`](../workflow-end/SKILL.md) (gate) → [`/watzup`](../watzup/SKILL.md) (core)

## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Get integration behavior proven through one workflow with two variants chosen by `--mode`: `write` (default) authors or updates spec-traced integration tests and proves them green with real assertion value; `green` drives a red, flaky or unproven suite to a truthful, repeatable green by fixing each failure at its owning layer.

**Python readiness:** when the selected runner requires Python, read `integration-test/references/mode-verify.md` → **Persistent Python readiness** before verification. Repair missing Python on Windows, macOS and Linux through that policy; reuse a compatible installation and prove discovery from a fresh shell before tests.

**Use when:** `write` — covering untested or changed behavior with integration tests, converting existing cases into test code, or auditing and stabilising an existing suite. `green` — a suite or a named test is red, flaky, or must be proven repeatably green. To reconcile specs and tests after a code change, use `/workflow-spec-sync`; for case authoring with no test code, run `/spec [mode=tests]` directly. Formerly `/workflow-write-integration-test` (`--mode=write`) and `/workflow-integration-test-green` (`--mode=green`).

**IMPORTANT MANDATORY Steps:** resolve the `workflow-integration-test` manifest variant for `--mode` first (default `write`), then create one task per returned occurrence (default: /investigate -> /spec [mode=tests] -> /work-item --mode=review --type=spec-tests -> /integration-test -> /integration-test --mode=review -> /integration-test --mode=verify -> /spec [mode=sync] -> /docs-manager --mode=update -> /workflow-end -> /watzup)

Variant step chains (each equals the registry variant of that name; gates and optional steps are declared there and restated in the variant reference):

- `write`: /investigate -> /spec [mode=tests] -> /work-item --mode=review --type=spec-tests -> /integration-test -> /integration-test --mode=review -> /integration-test --mode=verify -> /spec [mode=sync] -> /docs-manager --mode=update -> /workflow-end -> /watzup
- `green`: /investigate -> /integration-test --mode=verify --fix-loop -> /spec [mode=sync] -> /docs-manager --mode=update -> /workflow-end -> /watzup

**Step contract:** steps follow `/start-workflow` → Step Execution Protocol — `gate` steps always run, a step that runs invokes its `Skill` tool, and every other deviation is logged. NEVER batch-complete validation gates.

Activate the `workflow-integration-test` workflow. Run `/start-workflow workflow-integration-test` (add `--mode=green` for the green variant) with the user's prompt as context. The resolved variant is a complete sequence: execute that manifest and never a hand-swapped list.

## Mode Selection — FIRST Action

Pick the variant from the prompt (or an explicit `--mode=`) BEFORE creating tasks and record it, with the resolver fingerprint, in the workflow report. Every variant closes through `/workflow-end`, which checks the variant's own outcome gates.

| `--mode` | Pick it when | Deliverable | Outcome gates (registry) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **write** (default) | The prompt asks to write, add, update, convert or audit integration tests, cover changed or untested behavior, or generate tests from specs or feature docs; also when the prompt only says "integration tests" — state the assumption. | New or updated spec-traced integration tests, one one-pass review report, green runner evidence, synced cases | `spec-synced` · `review-converged` (one completed pass) · `tests-pass` · `run-closed` |
| **green** | The prompt says tests are failing, red, flaky or intermittent, asks to make them pass, drive the suite to green, or prove the suite repeatably green. An audit that turns up many failures hands the red suite to this variant. | A suite, or the named target, repeatably green with every failure adjudicated and fixed at its owning layer | `tests-pass` · `root-cause-traced` (when a verify run reported a failing test) · `spec-synced` (when a fix changed tested behavior or a test case) · `run-closed` |

## Variant `write`

**[BLOCKING]** When `--mode=write` (default) resolves, read `.claude/skills/workflow-integration-test/references/variant-write.md` in full FIRST — its triage, quality gates, recommended-skills table, orchestration limits, Test Architecture Contract handoff, reporting and loop bounds are the contract for this variant.

## Variant `green`

**[BLOCKING]** When `--mode=green` resolves, read `.claude/skills/workflow-integration-test/references/variant-green.md` in full FIRST — its triage, quality gates, recommended-skills table, inline-loop rules, Test Architecture Contract handoff, reporting and loop bounds are the contract for this variant.

<!-- PROTOCOL-GUIDES:END -->

<!-- SYNC:task-tracking-external-report:reminder -->

- **MANDATORY** Bootstrap task tracking before target work; transition one task at a time.
- **MANDATORY** Persist plan/review findings to `tmp/reports/` incrementally and synthesize from disk.

<!-- /SYNC:task-tracking-external-report:reminder -->


<!-- SYNC:goal-contract-satisfaction-loop:reminder -->

- **MANDATORY** Resolve the active Goal Contract BEFORE work (active plan `goal.md` → `<plans root>/goals/{YYMMDD-HHmm}-{slug}/goal.md`, plans root default `plans` and overridable via a `docsRoots.plans.path` entry in `docs/project-config.json` → create from current request) and read saved success criteria before editing.
- **MANDATORY** Append iteration evidence after execution; emit a Goal Satisfaction matrix (PASS/FAIL/BLOCKED) before reporting PASS; loop on validated FAIL; escalate repeated no-progress or blockers. NEVER store secrets in goal files.

<!-- /SYNC:goal-contract-satisfaction-loop:reminder -->

<!-- SYNC:test-architecture-execution-contract:reminder -->

**MUST ATTENTION** Each assertion-bearing test names the behavior or technical contract it protects and asserts an outcome it owns. Use the project's configured/native test format — Given/When/Then is one valid format, never a framework-wide requirement. When `specArtifacts` is valid, link configured owner/case/variant identity and `intent/contracts` evidence; when absent, name the guarded business intent or technical contract. A malformed declared profile BLOCKS without fallback. Broad test-format migration → assign an owner and next step, never rewrite cases outside scope.

**MUST ATTENTION** Before implementation record evidence-backed applicability for the test types and modes the task/project contract requires: copy-ready full and focused commands where available, zero-match behavior, a useful platform-appropriate entry point, supported execution modes and environments, state-isolation requirements, exact results, and repeat evidence where persistent state makes it relevant. Exercise claimed modes; report a missing required capability as `ENVIRONMENT-BLOCKED`. Never invent production targets or impose a test format. Browser/UI E2E uses the configured runner's waits or project helper for observable readiness and outcomes; apply action pacing only where the project contract specifies it. Reuse the project's evidenced test organization — require a POM, base class, or component taxonomy only when the project actually selects it.

<!-- /SYNC:test-architecture-execution-contract:reminder -->

<!-- SYNC:severity-rubric:reminder -->

- **MANDATORY** Classify every finding Critical/High/Medium/Low by consequence using the affected asset, shipped impact, exposure, reversibility, evidence location, and confidence; Critical/High/MEDIUM remain actionable under the round bar, while LOW is recorded/deferred from round 2 onward.
- **MANDATORY** A finding names a reachable trigger path (caller, input, state or event that reaches the defect) and a consequence; an unreachable concern is an observation, and unsettled reachability is `NOT VERIFIABLE` only when the concern would be MEDIUM or higher (an observation otherwise) — never a speculative LOW.
- **MANDATORY** Keep binary gates separate from severity: a failed test, security must-fix, required artifact, or parity check blocks at every round and is never relabeled LOW.
- **MANDATORY** Score-based skills (sre 0-2, perf two-axis) map onto the same four tiers — no parallel severity vocabulary.

<!-- /SYNC:severity-rubric:reminder -->

<!-- SYNC:session-goal-ledger:reminder -->

- **MANDATORY** Session goal ledger per the `Task Planning Rules`: pin `Original goal:`, keep `User prompts this session: P1…Pn`, and map the result to every prompt before claiming done; full text: `.claude/skills/shared/protocols/session-goal-ledger.md`.

<!-- /SYNC:session-goal-ledger:reminder -->

<!-- SYNC:environment-fault-hypothesis:reminder -->

**MUST ATTENTION** environment-fault gate: a bug, failed test, error, or odd output is NOT proof of a code defect. Sweep environment preconditions (versions, deps/install state, config & env vars, services, ports/network/clock, permissions, leftover state) and resource/transience suspects (RAM, CPU, disk, handles, network, timeouts) as a competing hypothesis, cite the discriminator you ran, and fix an environment cause in the environment — never by editing code or weakening a test. "Flaky" is a symptom, not a verdict.

<!-- /SYNC:environment-fault-hypothesis:reminder -->

## Closing Reminders

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION Goal:** `write` — write or update integration tests traced to canonical cases, complete one bounded review pass, and prove them green under the configured repeat policy; `green` — drive the resolved scope to a truthful, repeatable green: adjudicate, fix at the owner, review each fix, re-verify, then sync what the fixes made stale.

- **MUST ATTENTION** select `--mode` and read that variant's reference in full FIRST, then triage (size, kind, case state for `write`; scope and failure load for `green`) — why: depth follows risk, not test count, and a variant's gates live in its reference.
- **MUST ATTENTION** a failing test gets ONE written five-way Fault Verdict (`SOURCE-WRONG` · `TEST-WRONG` · `TEST-NOT-OPTIMAL` · `ENVIRONMENT-BLOCKED` · `AMBIGUOUS`) BEFORE any edit; NEVER force green — no weakened or removed assertions, skips, widened assertion timeouts, retried assertions, or narrowed scope — why: a weakened assertion protects nothing.
- **MUST ATTENTION** never claim verification without runner output; every pass/fail claim cites the command, exact counts and exit status.
- **MUST ATTENTION** `write`: read the production and test source BEFORE writing any assertion; every test names the invariant it protects and asserts an outcome the system owns — NEVER smoke-only. `green`: run the fix-loop and the skills it drives INLINE, and review every round's fix diff.
- **MUST ATTENTION** bootstrap exactly one task per selected occurrence before triage; record final consistency and lessons-learned checks under closure, write the report FIRST and cite `file:line` evidence.

**[TASK-PLANNING]** Resolve the variant, create all occurrence tasks with `TaskCreate`, then run its triage and execute the selected steps.
