## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Validate UI/frontend changes for the six visual-quality dimensions that break in production but slip past correctness review — long-content overflow & truncation, responsive multi-screen layout (flex-wrap / row-to-column so it stays usable on small devices), flex-grow vs fixed sizing, z-index scale discipline, SCSS/CSS/BEM styling quality, and async UI states & feedback (loading indicator, user-visible error surface, empty state, in-flight disable) — so frontend/UI changes survive real content, responsive layouts, layering, styling conventions, and the loading/error/empty branches before handoff.

**Default scope:** All uncommitted frontend changes (staged + unstaged) matching the frontend path and file-extension patterns declared by the project configuration/docs index. Override: specify files, directories, components, or full frontend codebase.

> **CONDITIONAL — SKIP when no frontend files in scope.** In workflow context this skill is SKIPPED when the diff has no files matching the project frontend path/extension patterns. If invoked standalone with no frontend changes → announce `"No frontend changes detected — ui-review skipped"` and report clean.

> **ROUTING BOUNDARY (read before starting):**
>
> - **`ui-review` (this skill)** — the project UI review gate. Purpose: find issues, assign severity, give project-specific fix guidance citing real reuse targets (sourced from the project reference docs). It complements `architecture-review`. In `workflow-review-changes` it runs in TWO places by design (keep both): (a) INTERNALLY as `changes-review`'s UI dimension (step 1), AND (b) as a DEDICATED conditional parallel-batch member (step 9, `ui-ux-designer` sub-agent). Both fire only when frontend files are in scope.
> - **`web-design-guidelines`** — a generic, standalone accessibility / UX checklist. Cross-read it for a11y depth (WCAG, focus order, ARIA, contrast); do NOT duplicate its content here.
> - **`ui-ux-designer`** — specialized UI/UX, accessibility, responsive layout, and design-token review/authoring sub-agent when the local agent catalog provides it.

> **MANDATORY MUST ATTENTION** Plan tasks to READ UI rules BEFORE reviewing:
>
> 1. Project styling rules doc — BEM convention, mixins, variables, responsive patterns **(READ FIRST — primary styling rules source; resolve via project config/docs index)**
> 2. Project design-system/token doc — design tokens, especially the **Z-Index & Layering** section
> 3. Project frontend architecture/patterns doc — base component classes, state/store, API service, lifecycle teardown rules shared with `architecture-review`
> 4. Project code-review rules doc — anti-patterns and conventions
>
> Not found → search: "scss styling", "design tokens", "frontend patterns". Rules come from docs — NOT general knowledge.

**Workflow:**

1. **Phase 0: Load UI Rules** — Resolve and read the four project UI/styling rule docs above
2. **Phase 1: Determine Scope** — Changed frontend files (default) or user-specified scope
3. **Phase 2: Blast Radius** — Run graph trace if graph.db exists
4. **Phase 3: UI Category Review** — Check each file against all 6 applicable categories
5. **Phase 4: Finalize** — Generate compliance report with PASS/BLOCKED/WARN verdicts
6. **Fix Loop: Validate → Fix → Full UI Re-Review** — validate findings first; after validated fixes, rerun the full UI review using the local sub-agent selection guide only when that protocol calls for agents

**Key Rules:**

- Write findings to `plans/reports/ui-review-{date}-{slug}.md`
- BLOCKED = must fix before merge | WARN = review and decide | PASS = compliant
- Every violation needs `file:line` proof + grep 3+ counterexamples before flagging
- Review is read-only until `/why-review --validate-findings` confirms findings; fixes may happen only in the validated fix loop or downstream plan/feature-implement, and every fix restarts a full UI review from Phase 0 with brand-new tasks.

## First Principle — Easy to Change

> **The success metric of every coding decision is _future change cost_.**
> DRY, SRP, abstraction, design patterns, naming, layering, tests — every
> technique exists to serve one goal: **making the next change cheaper**.

When evaluating styling, a layout, a token, or a component, ask:
**does this make the next change cheaper or more expensive?**

- Reject "best practices" that raise change cost (hardcoded values forcing
  per-file edits, hand-rolled overflow handling, raw breakpoints,
  copy-pasted truncation CSS).
- Name the real enemies in findings: **magic values, duplicated styling
  knowledge, fixed sizing that fights the viewport, cross-system token
  mixing, z-index escalation wars**.
- A simpler layout that survives 320px and a 200-char value beats a
  pixel-perfect fixed layout that breaks on either.

Apply this lens **before** invoking any specific rule, pattern, or checklist
below — if a downstream rule would raise change cost, this principle wins.

---

## Review Mindset (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Skeptical. Every claim needs traced proof, confidence >80%.

- NEVER flag a styling violation without reading the actual SCSS/template + tracing the rendered element
- Every finding MUST include `file:line` evidence
- Before flagging a pattern violation: grep 3+ existing examples — codebase convention wins
- Question: "Is this actually a violation, or an established exception (icon dimensions, fixed brand assets, genuinely fixed UI)?"

## Phase 0: Load UI Rules (MANDATORY FIRST) (MUST ATTENTION)

> **MUST ATTENTION:** Read project UI docs BEFORE reviewing. Rules come from docs, not general knowledge.

- read the project styling rules doc — extract BEM convention, mixin names, variable names, responsive breakpoint mixins, nesting limits
- read the project design-system/token doc — extract design tokens and the **Z-Index & Layering** section
- read the project frontend architecture/patterns doc — extract base component classes, store/effect patterns, API service base, lifecycle teardown pattern
- read the project code-review rules doc — extract frontend anti-patterns and review rules directly

> **CROSS-SYSTEM WARNING (carry through every category):** Do NOT mix token systems with incompatible root-size, namespace, or layer assumptions in one file. When flagging a fix, recommend whichever token system the file already imports/uses; never introduce another system unless the project docs explicitly require migration.

## Phase 1: Determine Scope

**Default (no override):** Review all uncommitted frontend changes.

```bash
git status          # List changed files
git diff            # Staged + unstaged changes
git diff --cached   # Staged only
```

- Collect file list to review
- Filter to files matching the project frontend path/extension patterns resolved from project config/docs
- If ZERO frontend files match → announce `"No frontend changes detected — ui-review skipped"` and report clean (honor the CONDITIONAL skip)

## Phase 2: Blast Radius (if graph.db exists)

- If `.code-graph/graph.db` exists: run graph trace on key changed component files
- Record: impacted file count, shared-component fan-out (a changed shared-library component affects every consumer app), risk level
- Prioritize review by highest-impact files first (shared library components > app-local components)
- Graph unavailable: note "Graph not available — skipping blast radius" and proceed

For each changed component/style file with downstream impact:

```bash
python .claude/scripts/code_graph trace <changed-file> --direction both --json
```

Use `--node-mode file` first (10-30x less noise), then `--node-mode function` for detail. Flag shared-component consumers impacted by a styling or layout change.

## Phase 3: UI Category Review

Create report: `plans/reports/ui-review-{date}-{slug}.md`

For EACH file in scope, evaluate against ALL applicable categories. Skip categories not applicable to the file type (e.g., a pure `.ts` store file skips overflow/sizing/z-index but still hits Category 5's architecture checks and Category 6's loading/error/empty-state wiring).

> **Apply the `Think:` reasoning prompt before each category — derive violations, do NOT recite checklists.**

---

### Category 1: Long-Content Overflow & Truncation — Severity: WARN (HIGH when a flex child truncates with no `min-width: 0`)

**Think:** Does every text container survive a 200-char value? Single-line or multi-line? Can the user still read the full value when it is truncated?

**Detection signals:**

- Hand-rolled `text-overflow: ellipsis` (with `white-space: nowrap` / `overflow: hidden` re-declared by hand) instead of the project mixin/directive
- A flex child that truncates but has **NO `min-width: 0`** — the flex-overflow trap: a flex item's default `min-width: auto` refuses to shrink below content width, so ellipsis never triggers
- Truncated text with **NO tooltip / `title`** to reveal the full value

**DECISION RULE the reviewer enforces:**

- Single-line labels / table cells / chips → ellipsis **+ tooltip-on-overflow**
- Multi-line prose / descriptions → wrap or `-webkit-line-clamp`

**Project fix guidance** (cite real reuse targets from the resolved styling rules doc):

- Prefer the project's documented overflow/ellipsis directive, component, or utility. It must expose the full value only when the element actually overflows and must handle the flex `min-width` trap.
- OR the project's documented truncate/text-ellipsis mixins or utility classes from the styling rules doc.
- Multi-line: use the project-documented clamp pattern.

**GOOD vs BAD:** a utility/token-driven truncation that exposes the full value on overflow (tooltip/`title`) is correct; a hand-rolled substring / width-math truncation, or truncated text with no tooltip, is the anti-pattern. Cite the styling rules doc for the project's reuse targets.

---

### Category 2: Responsive Multi-Screen via Flex — Severity: WARN (BLOCKED only when content is broken on a small screen — clipped, cut off, or unreachable)

**Think:** Is this usable at 320 / 768 / 1024 / 1440? Does the layout flex, wrap, and **reflow from row to column** on small screens? If it genuinely cannot reflow, does it at least stay *usable* via a fixed `min-width`/`min-height` + `overflow: auto` scroll — or does content get clipped, cut off, or pushed out of reach?

**Small-screen usability — the minimum bar (canonical):**

- **Preferred:** reflow — `flex-wrap: wrap`, a `flex-direction: row → column` switch at the breakpoint, or a responsive grid that collapses to a single column.
- **Acceptable fallback:** when a layout genuinely can't reflow (dense tables, canvases, diagrams, wide data grids), a fixed `min-width`/`min-height` with `overflow: auto` is fine — **scrolling is OK, not a defect.** Do NOT flag a component BLOCKED merely because it scrolls.
- **Hard minimum (BLOCKED if violated):** on a small screen the UI is *usable* and nothing is **broken** — no clipped, cut-off, or unreachable content/controls (e.g. a submit button pushed off-screen with no scroll path, text overlapping, a fixed row that overflows AND hides content instead of scrolling).
- **Escalation:** if making a surface small-screen-usable would need a refactor too large for the current change, STOP and **confirm scope with the user** before proceeding — note it as a finding, do not silently rewrite the layout.

**Detection signals:**

- Raw `@media (max-width: NNNpx)` / `(min-width: NNNpx)` in component SCSS that bypasses the breakpoint mixins
- A multi-child flex `row` with **NO `flex-wrap`**, **NO `flex-direction: column`** override, AND **no `overflow: auto`** escape → content is trapped and clips on a phone (BLOCKED); the same row WITH a scroll escape is at most WARN (prefer reflow)
- Multi-column CSS grid with fixed column counts / fixed track widths and no single-column collapse and no scroll container at small breakpoints
- Non-flex fixed layouts (absolute positioning, fixed px widths on containers) that cannot reflow AND cannot scroll → content lost off-screen
- Content clipped, overlapping, or a control pushed out of reach below ~360px with no scroll path (BLOCKED). Horizontal scroll *by itself*, with all content still reachable, is the acceptable fallback — not a finding.

**Project fix guidance:**

- Preferred: the project documented responsive-flex mixins/utilities; add `flex-wrap: wrap` and/or the documented `row → column` breakpoint switch so the layout stacks vertically on small screens
- Fallback (when reflow isn't feasible): give the container a sensible `min-width`/`min-height` and `overflow: auto` so everything stays reachable by scroll
- Breakpoints from the project breakpoint tokens — NEVER inline pixel breakpoints
- Large layout refactor required → surface it as a finding and confirm with the user; don't bundle a big responsive rewrite into an unrelated change

**Anti-patterns:** raw `@media` pixel breakpoints that bypass the project's breakpoint mixins; a `flex-direction: row` with no wrap, no column fallback, AND no scroll escape so content clips; and non-flex fixed grids that neither reflow nor scroll. Cite the styling rules doc for documented offenders; grep the changeset for the same patterns.

---

### Category 3: Flex-Grow vs Fixed Width/Height (prefer min/max) — Severity: WARN

**Think:** Must this size be fixed, or can it grow/shrink with content + viewport?

**Detection signals:**

- Fixed `width:` / `height:` in px (≥ ~3 digits) on containers / cards / forms / dialogs

**Project fix guidance:**

- Prefer `flex: 1` / `flex-grow` + `max-width` / `min-width` caps, and `min-width: 0` on truncating flex children
- The project flex-container mixin/utility documented in the styling rules doc
- Reserve fixed px for icons / borders / genuinely fixed UI

**Anti-patterns:** large fixed `width:` / `height:` in px on containers / cards / forms / dialogs (e.g. `width: 964px`, `height: 772px`) that should flex with content + viewport. Cite the styling rules doc for documented offenders.

---

### Category 4: Z-Index Scale Discipline — Severity: BLOCKED (HARD GATE)

**Think:** Which layer does this surface belong to (base / raised / dropdown / sticky / modal / toast)?

**Detection signals:**

- Raw numeric `z-index` (literal value instead of a token)
- **ANY `z-index` with `!important` → BLOCKED** (an escalation war that the next dev will only beat with a bigger literal)

**Project fix guidance — use tokens:**

- The project documented z-index layer tokens
- Existing legacy/framework token systems only when the current file already uses that system
- The semantic layer variables declared canonical by the project design-system doc

Cross-reference the project design-system **Z-Index & Layering** map. The chosen token MUST match the surface's semantic layer.

**GOOD vs BAD:** a `z-index` set from a semantic token / layer scale is correct; a raw literal (e.g. `z-index: 99999`, `z-index: 10000`) or `z-index: N !important` is the anti-pattern. Cite the design-system and styling docs for the project's token scale and documented offenders.

---

### Category 5: SCSS/CSS Best Practices & BEM — Severity: WARN (BLOCKED on `!important`, chained BEM modifiers)

**Think:** Does this stylesheet read cleanly, follow BEM, and use tokens — or does it hardcode, over-nest, and chain modifiers?

> **SCSS/BEM rules (canonical):** BEM classes on ALL template elements (`block__element--modifier`). No magic numbers — use variables / design tokens. Max 3 nesting levels.

**Detection signals:**

- Nesting > 3 levels
- Hardcoded hex colors (should use CSS vars / design tokens)
- `px` where `rem` is expected
- Chained BEM modifiers (`.block__element.--modifier`) — `.--mod` MUST be a separate class, NEVER chained → BLOCKED
- Template elements missing BEM classes
- `!important` → BLOCKED

Apply fixes per the resolved project styling rules doc.

**Frontend architecture checks (OWNED JOINTLY WITH `architecture-review` Category 8 — reference, do not drift):**

> These checks are lifted from `architecture-review` Category 8 so the two skills stay synchronized. They are **owned jointly**; when one changes, update both. They apply to the `.ts` files in scope:

- Components MUST extend the project-documented base component/form/store component classes (BLOCKED)
- State MUST use the project-documented store/effect pattern — NEVER ad hoc local state when the project provides a canonical store pattern (BLOCKED)
- API services MUST extend the project-documented API service base — NEVER raw HTTP clients when the project provides a service abstraction (BLOCKED)
- All subscriptions MUST use the project's auto-teardown operator — NEVER manual unsubscribe (BLOCKED)
- All template elements MUST have BEM classes (WARN)
- Logic in lowest layer: Model > Service > Component (WARN)

---

### Category 6: Async UI States & Feedback — Loading / Error / Empty / Disabled — Severity: BLOCKED (HARD GATE when an async fetch or mutation renders NO loading indicator OR NO user-visible error surface)

> **This is the fundamental UI-resilience gate.** A screen whose happy path renders perfectly but shows a frozen blank while loading, fails silently on error, or shows nothing when empty is a broken user experience. Every async or interactive surface MUST answer three questions for the user: *what do I see while it's working, when it fails, and when there's nothing?*

**Think:** For EACH async operation the file performs (data fetch, form submit, mutation, navigation-triggered load, subscription), trace what the user actually sees in the in-flight, failure, and zero-result branches — not just the success branch. If any of those three branches renders a blank/frozen screen or nothing at all, that is the finding.

**The essential states every async/interactive surface MUST handle** (canonical vocabulary — shared verbatim with `design-spec` "Component States Checklist": Default / Loading / Disabled / Error / Empty / Success):

- **Loading** — every in-flight async request MUST render a loading indicator (spinner / skeleton / progress bar), NEVER a frozen or blank screen. Lists/tables → skeleton rows; buttons → in-button spinner + disabled.
- **Error** — every operation that can fail (network, validation, server error) MUST surface a human-readable error to the user WITH a recovery/retry path where sensible. NEVER a silent failure, a swallowed `catch`, or a raw stack trace / raw error object rendered to the user.
- **Empty** — every collection / list / table view MUST render a meaningful empty state (message + optional CTA) when it has zero items, NOT a blank area.
- **Disabled / in-flight guard** — submit/action controls MUST disable (or show busy) while their request is in-flight, to prevent double-submission.
- **Success** — a completed mutation SHOULD give confirmation feedback (toast / inline / visibly updated data).

**Detection signals:**

- An async call (fetch / HTTP / `subscribe` / awaited mutation) whose template binds NO loading flag (`isLoading` / `pending` / `loading$` / skeleton) → **BLOCKED**
- A `.catch` / `try-catch` / error callback that logs or swallows the error but renders NO user-visible error surface → **BLOCKED**
- A raw error shown to the user (stack trace, raw JSON, unmapped exception) → WARN
- A list/table rendered from a collection with NO empty-state branch (`@empty`, `*ngIf="!items.length"`, `items.length === 0 ? …`) → WARN (BLOCKED when the collection is the screen's primary content)
- A submit handler that does NOT disable its trigger while in-flight (double-submit risk) → WARN (BLOCKED for payment / create / irreversible actions)

> **Check for centralized handling BEFORE flagging BLOCKED (avoid false positives):** many apps satisfy loading/error at the app level — a route-level progress bar, an HTTP interceptor that shows a global spinner/toast, an error boundary, or a base component that renders loading/error for all its children. If such a mechanism demonstrably covers this surface, the local component is compliant — grep for the shared mechanism (per this skill's "grep 3+ counterexamples / established exception" rule) and downgrade or drop the finding. Flag BLOCKED only when NO layer — local or global — gives the user a loading indicator / error surface.

**Project fix guidance** (cite real reuse targets from the resolved frontend/patterns + design-system docs):

- Prefer the project's documented loading component / skeleton / spinner and the documented error-banner / empty-state components or patterns — NEVER hand-roll one-off state UI when a canonical one exists.
- Bind loading / error / empty off the store / view-model / API-service state per the project's documented state pattern — state belongs in the lowest layer (Model > Service > Component), not improvised in the template.

**GOOD vs BAD:** a fetch bound to `isLoading` → skeleton, `error` → inline retry banner, and empty → placeholder is correct; a fetch that renders ONLY the populated happy path (blank while loading, nothing on error, blank when empty) is the anti-pattern. Cite the frontend-patterns and design-system docs for the project's reuse targets.

> **Note vs Category 5's Bug-Detection "Error Handling":** the shared Bug Detection protocol checks that `catch` scope is correct and exceptions are not swallowed at the *code* level; Category 6 checks that the failure/loading/empty branch produces a *user-visible* state at the *UI* level. Both must pass — a correctly-caught error that renders nothing still fails Category 6.

## Phase 4: Finalize — UI Compliance Report

Update report with final sections:

### Verdict Scoring

| Verdict     | Condition                                       |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **BLOCKED** | 1+ BLOCKED findings — must fix before merge     |
| **WARN**    | 0 BLOCKED, 1+ WARN findings — review and decide |
| **PASS**    | 0 BLOCKED, 0 WARN — UI compliant                |

> **Severity vocabulary (single source of truth).** Category headers and this verdict table use `BLOCKED` / `WARN` / `PASS`. The fresh sub-agent (Phase 5 and Round 2) emits `Critical / High / Medium / Low` + `PASS / FAIL` from the shared review-protocol template. Reconcile the two with this mapping — do NOT treat them as separate scales:
>
> | This skill | Sub-agent (Round 2) | Merge gate                    |
> | ---------- | ------------------- | ----------------------------- |
> | BLOCKED    | Critical / High → FAIL | Must fix before merge      |
> | WARN       | Medium / Low → WARN/INFO | Review and decide        |
> | PASS       | (no findings) → PASS | Merge-clear                  |
>
> A category's **"(HIGH when …)"** note is NOT a separate tier — it means that WARN **escalates to BLOCKED** when the stated condition holds (i.e., the finding is a real rendered bug, not a latent risk).

## Systematic Review Protocol (10+ changed frontend files)

1. **Categorize** — Group files by app / shared-library / component concern
2. **Parallel Sub-Agents** — Launch one UI/UX-specialized sub-agent per group with the UI-category checklist
3. **Synchronize** — Collect findings, cross-reference shared-component consumers and cross-system token mixing
4. **Consolidate** — Single holistic report with per-category verdicts

---

## Phase 5: Why-Review Findings Validation Gate (MANDATORY when findings exist)

> **Purpose:** Adversarial validation of own findings BEFORE handoff. Catches over-flagged Highs, false positives, and severity inflation at the source rather than letting them propagate downstream.

**Trigger:** Any finding produced (Critical, High, Medium, OR Low). Skip ONLY when the report's verdict is unconditional PASS with literally zero findings.

**Protocol:**

1. Read own finalized report from `plans/reports/ui-review-{date}-{slug}.md` (the exact path written in Phase 3 — NOT `{skill}-…`)
2. Invoke `/why-review --validate-findings plans/reports/ui-review-{date}-{slug}.md`
3. Read the validation verdict path returned by why-review, expected as `plans/reports/why-review-validate-{date}.md`
4. **If why-review demotes/removes any finding:** UPDATE own finalized report with revised severities, remove false positives, and add a `## Why-Review Validation Notes` section citing what changed and why
5. **If why-review confirms all findings:** Append `## Why-Review Validation` line to own report stating "All N findings re-validated against actual code; no severity changes."
6. **If the report changed after validation:** re-run this validation gate, maximum 2 validation passes, until the report's remaining findings are validated or zero findings remain.

**Skip conditions (record explicit reason if skipping):**

- Verdict is unconditional PASS with zero findings → log "Skipped — no findings to validate"
- Why-review skill itself is the active context (avoid recursion)

**Why this exists:** AI sub-agent reports inherit confirmation bias — the orchestrator absorbs severity claims as ground truth. The 2026-05-09 review incident produced 5 Highs; adversarial validation demoted 3 of them. Codify this as standard practice.

---

## Phase 6: Validated Fix + Full UI Re-Review Loop (MANDATORY when validated findings remain)

**Trigger:** Phase 5 returns CLEAN/validated and the UI review report still has one or more findings that must be fixed.

**Protocol:**

1. Create a fresh fix-cycle task list before editing. Do not reuse the review tasks.
2. Fix only findings that survived `/why-review --validate-findings`; route broader or cross-cutting fixes through the parent `/plan` + `/feature-implement` flow when this skill is running inside a workflow.
3. Run targeted verification for the fixed UI files and any affected consumers.
4. Re-invoke `/ui-review` from Phase 0 over the full current UI scope, not only the fixed files.
5. The re-run MUST create brand-new review tasks, reload the UI docs, determine scope again, rerun blast radius where applicable, and review every changed UI file from the start.
6. Repeat validate → fix → full UI re-review until a complete pass has zero findings.
7. If the same validated blocker repeats across 2 full invocations with no progress, stop and ask the user for a decision.

**Non-negotiable rules:**

- Never fix a finding before `/why-review --validate-findings` validates it.
- Never mark UI review clean after a targeted fix check only; the clean verdict must come from a full Phase 0 restart.
- Never review only fixed files during the recursive pass; analyze all UI files in scope again.
- Never reuse old todo/task items for the recursive review pass.

---

## Workflow Recommendation

> **MANDATORY — NO EXCEPTIONS:** If NOT already in a workflow, MUST use `AskUserQuestion` to ask user. Do NOT judge task complexity or decide "simple enough to skip" — user decides, not you:
>
> 1. **Activate `workflow-review-changes` workflow** (Recommended) — run the canonical workflow from `.claude/workflows.json`; it runs UI review in TWO places by design (keep both) — internally as `/changes-review`'s UI dimension AND as a dedicated conditional parallel-batch reviewer (step 9) — alongside findings validation, the other parallel reviewers, `code-simplifier` self-review, fix-plan cycle, full re-review restart, docs, and handoff.
> 2. **Execute `/ui-review` directly** — run this skill standalone

---

## Next Steps

**MANDATORY — NO EXCEPTIONS:** After completing, use `AskUserQuestion` to present:

- **"/code-simplifier" (Recommended)** — Simplify and refine the styling/component code
- **"/web-design-guidelines"** — Generic accessibility / UX checklist for a11y depth
- **"Skip, continue manually"** — user decides

## AI Agent Integrity Gate (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Before reporting ANY work done:

1. **Grep every removed name.** Extraction/rename/delete → grep confirms 0 dangling refs across ALL file types (SCSS `@use`, template class refs, TS imports)
2. **Ask WHY before changing.** Existing values intentional until proven otherwise — a fixed `width` may be a genuinely fixed UI element; no "fix" without traced rationale
3. **Verify ALL outputs.** One compiled stylesheet ≠ all consumers — a shared-component style change affects every consuming app
4. **Evaluate pattern fit.** Copying a nearby mixin/token? Verify the file imports/uses the SAME token system and does not mix incompatible project token systems
5. **New artifact = wired artifact.** Created a class/mixin? Prove it is imported, referenced in the template, and reachable

> **[IMPORTANT]** Use `TaskCreate` to break ALL work into small tasks BEFORE starting. Simple tasks: ask user whether to skip.

<!-- OVERRIDE:fresh-context-review -->

> **Fresh Context Re-Review** — Eliminate orchestrator confirmation bias after fixes by restarting the full review with isolated sub-agents where applicable.
>
> **Why:** The main agent knows what it (or `/feature-implement`) just fixed and rationalizes findings accordingly. A fresh sub-agent has ZERO memory, re-reads from scratch, and catches what the main agent dismissed. Sub-agent bias is mitigated by (1) fresh context, (2) verbatim protocol injection, (3) main agent not filtering the report.
>
> **When:** ONLY after a validated-finding fix cycle, or when the user/workflow explicitly requests an independent high-risk UI synthesis pass. A review pass that finds issues triggers validation first; it does NOT trigger a fresh-context pass over the same findings before validation/fix.
>
> **How:**

## Sub-Agent Type Override

> **MANDATORY:** UI reviews spawn the UI/UX-specialized sub-agent defined by the local sub-agent selection guide.
> Keep `subagent_type: "ui-ux-designer"` in the canonical template below when that agent type exists in the local catalog.
> **Rationale:** The shared sub-agent selection guide routes frontend UI/UX, accessibility, responsive layout, and design-token work to the UI/UX specialization. Do not fall back to a generic code-reviewer catch-all unless the local catalog lacks a UI/UX reviewer.

<!-- OVERRIDE:review-protocol-injection -->

> **Review Protocol Injection** — Every fresh sub-agent review prompt MUST embed 11 protocol blocks VERBATIM. The template below has ALL 11 bodies already expanded inline. Copy the template wholesale into the Agent call's `prompt` field at runtime, replacing only the `{placeholders}` in Task / Round / Reference Docs / Target Files / Output sections with context-specific values. Do NOT touch the embedded protocol sections.
>
> **Why inline expansion:** Placeholder markers would force file-read indirection at runtime. AI compliance drops significantly behind indirection (see `SYNC:shared-protocol-duplication-policy`). Therefore the template carries all 11 protocol bodies pre-embedded.

### Subagent Type Selection

- `ui-ux-designer` — default for UI reviews when the local agent catalog provides it
- `code-reviewer` — fallback only when the local catalog lacks a UI/UX-specialized reviewer

### Canonical Agent Call Template (Copy Verbatim)

```
Agent({
  description: "Fresh Round {N} UI review",
  subagent_type: "ui-ux-designer",
  prompt: `
## Task
{review-specific task — e.g., "Review all uncommitted frontend changes for UI quality: long-content overflow, responsive layout (flex-wrap / row→column, usable on small devices), flex-vs-fixed sizing, z-index discipline, SCSS/BEM, and async UI states & feedback (loading indicator, user-visible error surface, empty state, in-flight disable)" | "Review SCSS/template files under {path}"}

## Round
Round {N}. You have ZERO memory of prior rounds. Re-read all target files from scratch via your own tool calls. Do NOT trust anything from the main agent beyond this prompt.

## Protocols (follow VERBATIM — these are non-negotiable)

### Spec ↔ Tests ↔ Code Triangulation
DO THIS FIRST — before any per-protocol check below. The review target is the WHOLE PACKAGE, not the diff alone: load the behavior's spec (§3 ACs / §4 BRs / §8 TCs), its tests, and the changed code TOGETHER, and reason about their mutual consistency BEFORE judging any one in isolation.
1. Locate all three faces: the Feature Spec section(s) governing the changed behavior, the tests that guard it, and the production code that implements it. A missing face is itself a finding (SPEC-GAP / TEST-GAP / DEAD-SPEC).
2. Triangulate pairwise — every disagreement is a finding; classify which face is wrong:
   - code vs spec: behavior the code does that no §3/§4/§8 rule describes → CODE-EXTRA or SPEC-STALE; a [HARD] §4 rule or §5 invariant with no enforcing code path → CODE-WRONG.
   - tests vs spec: a §8 TC with no test, or a test asserting behavior no TC/rule names → TEST-GAP or SPEC-SILENT.
   - tests vs code: a changed code path with no covering test → TEST-GAP; a test that still passes against a deliberately broken invariant → WEAK-TEST (apply the mutation thinking in Bug Detection).
3. Hidden-rule capture: any invariant the code enforces but the spec never states (SPEC-SILENT) MUST be surfaced as a finding to add into §3/§4/§8 AND guarded with a test — the enrichment loop, never a silent pass.
4. Only after the three faces agree — or every disagreement is logged as a finding — proceed to the per-protocol checks below; when enrichment adds spec/test content, re-review the package against the enriched spec.
NEVER mark review PASS while any spec/test/code face disagrees without a logged finding. The diff is the entry point; the package is the unit of judgment.

### Evidence-Based Reasoning
Speculation is FORBIDDEN. Every claim needs proof.
1. Cite file:line, grep results, or framework docs for EVERY claim
2. Declare confidence: >80% act freely, 60-80% verify first, <60% DO NOT recommend
3. Cross-service validation required for architectural changes
4. "I don't have enough evidence" is valid and expected output
BLOCKED until: Evidence file path (file:line) provided; Grep search performed; 3+ similar patterns found; Confidence level stated.
Forbidden without proof: "obviously", "I think", "should be", "probably", "this is because".
If incomplete → output: "Insufficient evidence. Verified: [...]. Not verified: [...]."

### Bug Detection
MUST check categories 1-4 for EVERY review. Never skip.
1. Null Safety: Can params/returns be null? Are they guarded? Optional chaining gaps? .find() returns checked?
2. Boundary Conditions: Off-by-one (< vs <=)? Empty collections handled? Zero/negative values? Max limits?
3. Error Handling: Try-catch scope correct? Silent swallowed exceptions? Error types specific? Cleanup in finally?
4. Resource Management: Connections/streams closed? Subscriptions unsubscribed on destroy? Timers cleared? Memory bounded?
5. Concurrency (if async): Missing await? Race conditions on shared state? Stale closures? Retry storms?
6. Stack-Specific: Check the configured language/runtime pitfalls and framework-specific failure modes discovered from local code.
Classify: CRITICAL (crash/corrupt) → FAIL | HIGH (incorrect behavior) → FAIL | MEDIUM (edge case) → WARN | LOW (defensive) → INFO.

### Design Patterns Quality
Priority checks for every code change:
1. DRY via OOP: Same-suffix classes (*Entity, *Dto, *Service) MUST share base class. 3+ similar patterns → extract to shared abstraction.
2. Right Responsibility: Logic in LOWEST layer (Entity > Domain Service > Application Service > Controller). Never business logic in controllers.
3. SOLID: Single responsibility (one reason to change). Open-closed (extend, don't modify). Liskov (subtypes substitutable). Interface segregation (small interfaces). Dependency inversion (depend on abstractions).
4. After extraction/move/rename: Grep ENTIRE scope for dangling references. Zero tolerance.
5. YAGNI gate: NEVER recommend patterns unless 3+ occurrences exist. Don't extract for hypothetical future use.
Anti-patterns to flag: God Object, Copy-Paste inheritance, Circular Dependency, Leaky Abstraction.

### Logic & Intention Review
Verify WHAT code does matches WHY it was changed.
1. Change Intention Check: Every changed file MUST serve the stated purpose. Flag unrelated changes as scope creep.
2. Happy Path Trace: Walk through one complete success scenario through changed code.
3. Error Path Trace: Walk through one failure/edge case scenario through changed code.
4. Acceptance Mapping: If plan context available, map every acceptance criterion to a code change.
5. Tests Verify Intent: For test/spec changes, verify tests name the protected business rule or invariant and would fail if that intent breaks.
6. Migration Test Exclusion: Do not write tests for migration code. Schema/data migrations are one-time execution paths, not core application logic.
NEVER mark review PASS without completing both traces (happy + error path).

### Test Spec Verification
Map changed code to test specifications.
1. Identify the project's test/spec format from existing docs, test-case files, BDD feature files, or spec folders.
2. Every changed code path MUST map to a corresponding test case/spec (or flag as "needs test case").
3. New functions/endpoints/handlers → flag for test spec creation.
4. Migration files are excluded from test/spec creation; schema/data migrations are one-time execution paths, not core application logic.
5. If spec evidence fields exist, verify they point to actual code (file:line, not stale references).
6. Verify each meaningful test case names the business intent/invariant; flag behavior-only cases that only mirror implementation details.
7. Auth/data changes → verify corresponding authorization and data-state test cases exist.
8. If no specs exist for a changed path → log the gap and recommend the project's test-spec workflow.
NEVER skip test mapping. Untested code paths are the #1 source of production bugs.

### Behavioral Delta Matrix
MANDATORY for any bugfix review. Produce input-state × pre-fix × post-fix × delta table BEFORE writing verdict.
- Minimum 3 rows; include at least one row OUTSIDE the original bug report.
- Any "REGRESSION" delta → review returns FAIL until a preservation test is added.
- Narrative descriptions do NOT substitute for the matrix.
Example rows (external-record sync fix):
| Input                 | Pre-fix | Post-fix                  | Delta      |
| --------------------- | ------- | ------------------------- | ---------- |
| Record exists (valid) | Reused  | Always recreated → orphan | REGRESSION |
| Record missing (404)  | Error   | Recreated                 | Fixed      |

### Fix-Layer Accountability
NEVER fix at the crash site. Trace the full flow, fix at the owning layer. The crash site is a SYMPTOM, not the cause.
MANDATORY before ANY fix:
1. Trace full data flow — Map the complete path from data origin to crash site across ALL layers (storage → backend → API → frontend → UI). Identify where bad state ENTERS, not where it CRASHES.
2. Identify the invariant owner — Which layer's contract guarantees this value is valid? Fix at the LOWEST layer that owns the invariant, not the highest layer that consumes it.
3. One fix, maximum protection — If fix requires touching 3+ files with defensive checks, you are at the wrong layer — go lower.
4. Verify no bypass paths — Confirm all data flows through the fix point. Check for direct construction skipping factories, clone/spread without re-validation, raw data not wrapped in domain models, mutations outside the model layer.
BLOCKED until: Full data flow traced (origin → crash); Invariant owner identified with file:line evidence; All access sites audited (grep count); Fix layer justified (lowest layer that protects most consumers).
Anti-patterns (REJECT): "Fix it where it crashes" (crash site ≠ cause site, trace upstream); "Add defensive checks at every consumer" (scattered defense = wrong layer); "Both fix is safer" (pick ONE authoritative layer).

### Rationalization Prevention
AI skips steps via these evasions. Recognize and reject:
- "Too simple for a plan" → Simple + wrong assumptions = wasted time. Plan anyway.
- "I'll test after" → RED before GREEN. Write/verify test first.
- "Already searched" → Show grep evidence with file:line. No proof = no search.
- "Just do it" → Still need TaskCreate. Skip depth, never skip tracking.
- "Just a small fix" → Small fix in wrong location cascades. Verify file:line first.
- "Code is self-explanatory" → Future readers need evidence trail. Document anyway.
- "Combine steps to save time" → Combined steps dilute focus. Each step has distinct purpose.

### Graph-Assisted Investigation
MANDATORY when .code-graph/graph.db exists.
HARD-GATE: MUST run at least ONE graph command on key files before concluding any investigation.
Pattern: Grep finds files → trace --direction both reveals full system flow → Grep verifies details.
- Investigation/Scout: trace --direction both on 2-3 entry files
- Fix/Debug: callers_of on buggy function + tests_for
- Feature/Enhancement: connections on files to be modified
- Code Review: tests_for on changed functions
- Blast Radius: trace --direction downstream
CLI: python .claude/scripts/code_graph {command} --json. Use --node-mode file first (10-30x less noise), then --node-mode function for detail.

### Understand Code First
HARD-GATE: Do NOT write, plan, or fix until you READ existing code.
1. Search 3+ similar patterns (grep/glob) — cite file:line evidence.
2. Read existing files in target area — understand structure, base classes, conventions.
3. Run python .claude/scripts/code_graph trace <file> --direction both --json when .code-graph/graph.db exists.
4. Map dependencies via connections or callers_of — know what depends on your target.
5. Write investigation to .ai/workspace/analysis/ for non-trivial tasks (3+ files).
6. Re-read analysis file before implementing — never work from memory alone.
7. NEVER invent new patterns when existing ones work — match exactly or document deviation.
BLOCKED until: Read target files; Grep 3+ patterns; Graph trace (if graph.db exists); Assumptions verified with evidence.

## Reference Docs (READ before reviewing)
- {resolved project styling rules doc}
- {resolved project design-system/token doc, especially Z-Index & Layering}
- {resolved project frontend architecture/patterns doc}
- {resolved project code-review rules doc}

## Target Files
{explicit file list OR "run git diff and filter by the project frontend path/extension patterns"}

## Output
Write a structured report to plans/reports/ui-review-round{N}-{date}.md with sections:
- Status: PASS | FAIL
- Issue Count: {number}
- Critical Issues (with file:line evidence)
- High Priority Issues (with file:line evidence)
- Medium / Low Issues
- Cross-cutting findings (cross-system token mixing, shared-component fan-out)

Return the report path and status to the main agent.
Every finding MUST have file:line evidence. Speculation is forbidden.
`
})
```

### Rules

- DO copy the template wholesale — including all 11 embedded protocol sections
- DO replace only the `{placeholders}` in Task / Round / Reference Docs / Target Files / Output sections with context-specific content
- DO keep the UI/UX-specialized `subagent_type` for UI reviews when the local catalog provides it (see Sub-Agent Type Override above)
- DO NOT paraphrase, summarize, or skip any protocol section
- DO NOT pass file contents inline — the sub-agent reads via its own tool calls so it has a fresh context
- DO NOT reference protocols by file path or tag name — the bodies are already embedded above
- DO NOT introduce placeholder markers for the protocols — they must stay literally expanded

<!-- /OVERRIDE:review-protocol-injection -->

> **Critical Purpose:** UI quality — no content overflow without escape, no broken responsive layouts (rows that never wrap or stack on small devices), no fixed sizing fighting the viewport, no z-index escalation wars, no styling/BEM drift, and no async surface that leaves the user staring at a frozen blank while loading, a silent failure on error, or a blank area when empty.

> **External Memory:** Complex/lengthy work → write findings to `plans/reports/`. Prevents context loss, serves as deliverable.

> **Evidence Gate:** MANDATORY — every finding requires `file:line` proof + confidence percentage (>80% act, <80% verify first).

<!-- OVERRIDE-NOTE:fresh-context-review -->

> **`fresh-context-review` is intentionally OVERRIDE-only in this skill** — see the `OVERRIDE:fresh-context-review` block above (it uses the UI/UX-specialized `ui-ux-designer` subagent_type, NOT the generic `code-reviewer`). The generic `SYNC:fresh-context-review` copy is deliberately omitted here so the two cannot drift into a `code-reviewer` vs `ui-ux-designer` contradiction. This mirrors how `OVERRIDE:review-protocol-injection` is handled (override-only, no generic SYNC copy). **Do NOT re-add the generic `SYNC:fresh-context-review` block** — the `sync-inline-versions.md` propagation only updates existing `SYNC:` markers, so omission is stable.

<!-- /OVERRIDE-NOTE:fresh-context-review -->

> **Complexity Prevention (UI-scoped)** — measure code by cost of change: one UI change should map to one code change. The full backend-OOP treatise (anemic models, primitive obsession, value objects, repo leakage) does not apply to UI review and is intentionally not carried here. UI-relevant essence: (1) **extract repeated component lifecycle** — 3+ forms/list views reimplementing loading/dirty/submit/pagination → base component / hook / composable / mixin; (2) **keep derivations, formatting, and validation off the template** — move them onto the model / store / view-model / API service, not inline in the component. For deeper OOP/DRY structural review of any backend the UI calls, defer to `/changes-review` / `/architecture-review`.

>
> From round 3 onward LOW findings are **NOT required to be fixed**: a round whose validated findings are ALL LOW **ENDS the loop immediately** — do not open another round for them. Severity tiers are `SYNC:severity-rubric` (CRITICAL block-merge · HIGH must-fix · MEDIUM should-fix · LOW nice-to-fix); rounds 1-2 are unchanged, so an easy LOW still gets fixed early when it is cheap.
>
> **Severity-floor rules:**
>
> - **Never silently drop a deferred LOW.** Every unfixed LOW is listed in the final report under `## Deferred LOW Findings (severity floor, round ≥3)` with file, line, and description, so the owner can schedule it. Dropping it from the report is a protocol violation, not a clean pass.
> - **Never re-tier a finding to trigger the exit.** Downgrading a real CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM to LOW so the loop can end is a FALSE PASS. Severity is set by consequence per `SYNC:severity-rubric` before the round bar is applied — never after, and never with the exit in view. — why: a floor that can be reached by relabeling is not a floor.
> - **The floor bounds the loop, not the standard.** It ends *iteration*; it never authorizes shipping a known CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM, and it never lowers the finding-survival bar that admits a finding in the first place.
> - **The floor never applies to a hard gate.** Test-green gates (a suite must actually pass), security must-fix gates, and any gate whose criterion is binary rather than severity-rated are unaffected — a failing test is a failure, not a LOW finding.
>
> **Universal scope (any new output/judgment):** any newly produced output or judgment gets **≥1 self-review**; any **new judgment** gets **≥1 `/why-review --validate-findings` pass**; anything flagged to re-check is re-checked **≥1 time** — before that output is treated as final. This loop is the default convergence contract for ANY work-producing skill, not review skills only.
>
> **Routing invariant (author-facing):** a skill that validates findings MUST route them through `/why-review --validate-findings` (the terminal validator) — NEVER fork an inline finding-validation. Routing through why-review is what makes the finding-survival bar and this loop apply; the `verify-review-validate-coverage` sensor enforces this exact route mechanically.
>
> **Round 1:** Main-session review. Read target files, build understanding, note issues. Output findings + verdict (PASS / FAIL).
>
> **Decision after Round 1:**
>
> - **No issues found (PASS, zero findings)** → review ENDS. Do NOT spawn a fresh sub-agent for confirmation.
> - **`blocking_findings(round, findings)` is non-empty** → run the active review skill's findings-validation gate first; for review skills the default gate is `/why-review --validate-findings <report-path>`. Fix only validated findings, then restart the full review protocol from the beginning with a fresh task breakdown.
>
> **Fresh full re-review after every fix cycle:** Re-run the whole review protocol over the current full target. When sub-agents are part of that protocol, spawn NEW `Agent` calls — never reuse prior agents. Reviewers re-read ALL files from scratch with ZERO memory of prior rounds. See `SYNC:fresh-context-review` for the spawn mechanism and `SYNC:review-protocol-injection` for the canonical Agent prompt template. Each fresh full review must catch:
>
> - Cross-cutting concerns missed in the prior round
> - Interaction bugs between changed files
> - Convention drift (new code vs existing patterns)
> - Missing pieces that should exist but don't
> - Subtle edge cases the prior round rationalized away
> - Regressions introduced by the fixes themselves
>
> **Loop termination:** After each full re-review, repeat the same decision against **that round's exit bar**: bar cleared → END; blocking findings remain → validate findings → fix → restart from the first review phase. Rounds 1-2 clear on zero findings at any severity; **from round 3 the bar is zero CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM, so a LOW-only round ENDS the loop** (deferred LOWs go in the report). Capped at **3 rounds**. Escalate via `AskUserQuestion` at whichever comes first: the same validated finding repeats for 2 full invocations with no progress · a fix requires product/owner input · round 3 completes with CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM still open. NEVER loop past 3 rounds, and NEVER convert cap exhaustion into a PASS.
>
> **Rules:**
>
> - A clean Round 1 ENDS the review — no mandatory Round 2
> - From round 3 on, a round whose validated findings are ALL LOW ENDS the loop — never open round N+1 to fix LOW alone; list those LOWs as deferred instead
> - NEVER re-tier a CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM down to LOW to reach the round-3 exit — severity is assigned by consequence before the bar is applied
> - NEVER fix unvalidated findings; validate first using the caller's validation gate
> - Every surviving finding must additionally clear the **finding-survival bar** defined in why-review's Findings Validation Routine (a deliberately higher bar than the generic act-gate — "keep this finding?" is a stricter question than "act on this evidence?"); a finding below the bar is demoted or dropped, not kept
> - NEVER skip the full re-review after a fix cycle (every fix invalidates the prior verdict)
> - NEVER reuse a sub-agent across rounds — every iteration that uses sub-agents spawns NEW Agent calls
> - Main agent READS sub-agent reports but MUST NOT filter, reinterpret, or override findings
> - The 3-round cap NEVER replaces the clean-review requirement — it bounds runaway looping, it does not authorize shipping an un-clean review; a clean pass ends the loop early at any round, and cap exhaustion escalates rather than passes
> - Enforce the round cap of 3 alongside the 2 repeated-no-progress blocker rule; both are escalation triggers, neither is a completion criterion
> - Track recursive invocation count and repeated blockers in conversation context (session-scoped)
> - Final verdict must incorporate ALL rounds executed
>
> **Report must include `## Round N Findings (Fresh Sub-Agent)` for every round N≥2 that was executed, plus `## Deferred LOW Findings (severity floor, round ≥3)` whenever the loop ended on the round-3+ bar with LOWs still open.**

> **AI Mistake Prevention** — Failure modes to avoid on every task:
>
> **Re-read files after context changes.** Context compaction, resume, or long-running work can make memory stale; verify current files before acting.
> **Verify generated content against source evidence.** AI hallucinates APIs, names, claims, and document facts. Check the relevant source before documenting or referencing.
> **Check downstream references before deleting or renaming.** Removing an artifact can stale docs, generated mirrors, configs, and callers; map references first.
> **Trace the full impact chain after edits.** Changing a definition can miss derived outputs and consumers. Follow the affected chain before declaring done.
> **Verify ALL affected outputs, not just the first.** One green check is not all green checks; validate every output surface the change can affect.
> **Assume existing values are intentional — ask WHY before changing OR flagging one as a defect.** Before changing or reporting a constant, limit, flag, cutoff, wording, or pattern, read nearby context and history, the CALLER's ordering, and 2+ sibling call sites of the same convention. A doc stating WHAT without WHY is missing rationale, not proof of a missing guard.
> **Surface ambiguity before acting — don't pick silently.** Multiple valid interpretations require an explicit question or stated assumption with risk.
> **Assert the outcome your system owns, not the intermediate state your infrastructure owns.** When verifying async work, assert the final business state — never the delivery/retry bookkeeping held in shared infrastructure that any co-running process can write. Such a check passes when run alone and flakes the moment anything else shares that infrastructure.

<!-- SYNC:systematic-review-batching -->

> **Systematic Review Batching (map-reduce)** — When a changeset is large, do NOT review files one-by-one. Partition into size-capped batches, fire one specialized sub-agent per batch in parallel, then reduce. This bounds EVERY context — each batch agent AND the orchestrator — so coverage stays complete as file count grows.
>
> **Trigger ladder (one ordered escalation — not competing thresholds):**
>
> 1. **< 10 changed files** → sequential per-file review (default; no batching).
> 2. **≥ 10 changed files** → switch to systematic parallel mode. Announce: `"Detected {N} changed files. Switching to systematic parallel review protocol."` Then: categorize → size-capped batches → flat consolidation.
> 3. **categories > 6 OR files > 40** → additionally insert the hierarchical synthesis tier (below). Everything from rung 2 still applies.
>
> **Step 1 — Categorize.** Group changed files into logical categories derived from the project's actual structure (not forced). Category is the *concern axis*; orient with these examples, derive what fits the repository:
>
> | Category Type | Example Groupings |
> | --- | --- |
> | Agent/Tooling | AI scripts, hooks, skill definitions, workflow configs, linting rules |
> | Root config/docs | Root README, project config, CI/CD pipeline configs |
> | Reference docs | Architecture docs, patterns references, setup guides |
> | Feature/domain docs | Business feature documentation, spec files, ADRs |
> | Backend logic | Service/handler/controller source (infer from project structure) |
> | Frontend logic | UI component/state/API source (infer from project structure) |
> | Data/Schema | Migrations, schema files, seed data |
> | Tests | Unit, integration, E2E test files |
> | Infrastructure | Docker, k8s, CI/CD, cloud manifests |
>
> **Step 2 — Size-capped batches.** One sub-agent per batch of **≤8 files OR ≤2000 diff-lines**, whichever hits first. Category stays the concern axis, but any category exceeding a cap splits into multiple size-capped batches (30 backend files → 4 batches). Size caps — not category caps — make "many files" safe: a category cap alone lets one giant category blow a single agent's context.
>
> **Step 2a — Sub-agent type per batch** (match the batch's dominant concern):
>
> - Code logic (any stack) → `code-reviewer`
> - Security-sensitive changes → `security-auditor`
> - Performance-critical paths → `performance-optimizer`
> - Docs, plans, specs, configs, infra → `general-purpose`
>
> Each batch sub-agent receives: its full file list; `SYNC:category-review-thinking` as its primary thinking model — derive each category's concerns from first principles, NOT a fixed checklist (if the consuming skill does not carry that block, apply category-first thinking directly); project reference docs relevant to its concern (discover via `*patterns*`, `*conventions*`, `*style-guide*`); cross-reference verification instructions (counts, tables, links). All batch agents run in parallel and write findings to `plans/reports/` (per `SYNC:task-tracking-external-report`); reducers read from disk, never from memory.
>
> **Step 3 — Reduce.**
>
> - **Flat reduction (rung 2, ≤6 categories AND ≤40 files):** the orchestrator collects each batch report, cross-references counts/tables/contracts ACROSS batches, detects gaps visible only across categories (feature in code but missing from docs; new API endpoint with no client call), and consolidates into one categorized holistic report.
> - **Hierarchical reduction (rung 3, > 6 categories OR > 40 files):** insert a mid-tier — each concern gets ONE synthesizer agent that reads only its own batch reports and emits a single concern-synthesis. The orchestrator reads the **concern-syntheses (~5)**, never the raw batch reports — keeping the reducer's context O(#concerns), not O(#files).
>   - **Cross-concern interaction pass (mandatory at rung 3 — closes the synthesis-tier blind spot):** concern-siloed synthesis can drop an interaction spanning two concerns AND two batches (tainted source in data-layer/batch 7 → sink in api/batch 3). So: (a) each concern-synthesizer MUST emit an explicit **"cross-concern interaction candidates"** list — entities/symbols/contracts it touched that plausibly bind to another concern (shared DTOs, event names, table/collection names, exported symbols); (b) the orchestrator MUST run the Step-3 cross-reference/gap step **over those candidate lists across all concern-syntheses**, not only within a batch, before concluding. Without this pass the tier trades completeness for context-bounding on exactly the large diffs it targets.
>
> **Step 4 — Holistic assessment.** With all findings combined, judge: overall coherence as a unified intent; cross-category sync (docs match code? contracts match callers?); risk areas where categories interact; missing doc/spec updates for changed artifacts.
>
> **No silent truncation.** If any cap forces sampling or a batch is dropped for budget, ANNOUNCE the dropped/sampled scope explicitly — bounded coverage must never read as complete coverage.

<!-- SYNC:severity-rubric -->

> **Severity Rubric** — Classify every finding by consequence, not by how easy it is to fix. One scale across all reviews so a "High" means the same thing everywhere.
>
> | Severity | Action | Definition |
> | --- | --- | --- |
> | CRITICAL | Block merge | Silent runtime failure, data corruption, validation bypass, security hole |
> | HIGH | Must fix | Incorrect behavior, invariant gap, architectural violation |
> | MEDIUM | Should fix | Design debt, maintainability, likely future bug |
> | LOW | Nice to fix | Convention, documentation, minor clarity |
>
> **Score-based skills** map their numeric scale onto these tiers — do not invent a parallel vocabulary:
>
> - **0-2 criterion scoring** (e.g. production-readiness-review): `0` = CRITICAL/HIGH (criterion unmet, blocks production readiness), `1` = MEDIUM (partial, should fix), `2` = pass (no finding).
> - **Two-axis scoring** (e.g. performance-review, impact × likelihood): map the resulting cell to the nearest tier — high-impact + high-likelihood → CRITICAL/HIGH; low-impact OR low-likelihood → MEDIUM/LOW.
>
> A finding's tier drives the gate: CRITICAL/HIGH must be resolved or explicitly accepted by the owner before PASS; MEDIUM/LOW may ship with a tracked follow-up.

<!-- SYNC:category-review-thinking -->

> **Category Review Thinking** — A thinking framework for reviewing any category of changed files. NOT a fixed checklist — derive concerns from domain knowledge; the examples are starting points only. Your knowledge of the category exceeds any list here — trust it.
>
> **Step 1 — Understand the category's role.** What is this category responsible for in the overall system? What invariants must it uphold? What are its consumer contracts (who depends on it, what do they expect)?
>
> **Step 2 — Read project conventions for this category.** Search for reference docs, style guides, ADRs, or READMEs specific to this area. Grep 3+ existing similar files — extract naming conventions, structural patterns, shared base classes. If no docs exist, derive conventions empirically from existing code.
>
> **Step 3 — Derive concerns from first principles.** Apply all that are relevant; expand beyond this list based on the actual category:
>
> - **Correctness:** Does the logic match the intent? Trace happy path AND error path.
> - **Boundary contracts:** Are interfaces/APIs/events/protocols honored? No implicit coupling introduced?
> - **Project conventions:** Does new code follow the patterns found in Step 2? Evidence-confirmed, not assumed.
> - **Security:** Auth enforced at every entry point? Input validated at boundaries? No secrets in the diff?
> - **Performance:** Unbounded operations? N+1 patterns? Blocking calls in async context? Unindexed queries?
> - **Maintainability:** DRY? Single responsibility? Complexity within reason? Names reveal intent?
> - **Test coverage:** Are the changed paths covered by tests? Are existing tests still valid after the change?
> - **Documentation:** Do related docs, specs, or READMEs reflect the changes?
>
> **Step 4 — Create sub-tasks and execute.** For each identified concern: create a `TaskCreate` sub-task, work through it with `file:line` evidence, mark done. No findings without proof.
>
> **Illustrative concern examples by category type** (not exhaustive — trust your knowledge beyond this):
>
> - _Server-side logic:_ handler/service structure conventions, validation layer placement, side-effect isolation, cross-service boundary enforcement, data-access layer separation, error propagation strategy
> - _Client-side logic:_ component lifecycle management, resource cleanup (subscriptions, listeners, timers), state management patterns, API integration layer separation, reactive stream composition
> - _Data/Schema:_ migration reversibility (rollback script), lock impact on table volume, backfill idempotency, index coverage for query patterns, deployment ordering
> - _Configuration:_ present in ALL environments? No secrets in diff? App fails fast if config missing (not silently null)? Documented in setup guide?
> - _Infrastructure:_ dev/prod parity? No hardcoded dev values (localhost, debug flags)? Pinned image/dependency versions? CI/CD secret requirements documented?
> - _Styles/Assets:_ follows project naming conventions? Uses design variables/tokens (no hardcoded magic values)? Correct scope (no global side effects from component styles)?
> - _Documentation:_ accurate? Links valid? Examples still match current code/behavior? Covers new scenarios?
> - _Tests:_ assertions verify specific outcomes (not just "no exception")? Idempotent (repeatable N times)? Covers edge cases, not just happy path?
> - _Security artifacts:_ all code paths reach the gate? Negative tests exist (unauthorized denied)? Both enforcement AND display control updated?
> - _Build/Tooling:_ rule changes apply consistently? No exceptions that silently swallow violations? Impact on CI runtime documented?

>
> 1. **Resolve the active goal** (in order): active plan `goal.md` → `plans/goals/{YYMMDD-HHmm}-{slug}/goal.md` → create a new Goal Contract from the current user request (template: `.claude/templates/goal-contract-template.md`).
> 2. **Required sections:** Original Request, Purpose, Success Criteria (checkboxes; mark required vs optional), Constraints, Evidence Required, Iteration Log, Goal Satisfaction matrix.
> 3. **Before work:** read the active goal and map planned work to saved success criteria — execution serves the saved criteria, never chat memory alone.
> 4. **After execution/verification:** append an Iteration Log entry — result, evidence references (`file:line`, command output, report path), remaining gaps.
> 5. **Review gate:** emit a Goal Satisfaction matrix — `| Success Criterion | Evidence | Status |` with PASS/FAIL/BLOCKED. Overall PASS requires every required criterion PASS.
> 6. **Loop rule (retry):** required criterion FAIL → validate the gap is real → fix → re-review only the affected criteria. Stop cleanly when all required criteria PASS.
> 7. **Escalation rule (stop):** two consecutive iterations with no criterion progressing, or a blocker needing user input → mark the criterion BLOCKED with a user-facing reason and escalate. NEVER loop indefinitely.
> 8. **Skip rule:** tiny conversational tasks may skip the goal file ONLY with a recorded one-line reason. User-accepted gate skips are recorded in the goal file with reason and scope.
> 9. **Security:** NEVER store secrets, tokens, credentials, or private customer data in goal files — store evidence references and redact sensitive values.

<!-- SYNC:trade-off-interrogation-gate -->

> **Trade-Off Interrogation Gate** — ALWAYS ask these THREE questions before ANY verdict, score, finding, or recommendation — about the thing under review AND about every recommendation YOU make. — why: naming a benefit without its price is an endorsement, not a review; the costliest trade-offs are the ones nobody wrote down.
>
> 1. **Is there any trade-off?** Name what it SACRIFICES. "None" / "pure win" is an unfinished analysis, NOT an answer — to claim none, state which dimensions you checked and why each is unaffected: future change cost · complexity · performance/latency · memory/cost · coupling · reversibility · migration burden · operational load · blast radius · security posture · testability · team skill/ramp · delivery time · UX.
> 2. **Is it worth it?** Weigh gain against sacrifice EXPLICITLY — what is gained (with a metric) · what it costs · WHO pays · WHEN it comes due — then emit **WORTH IT / NOT WORTH IT / UNCLEAR**. "Better" with no metric and no cost FAILS this question. NOT WORTH IT → withdraw or replace the recommendation, never keep it as-is.
> 3. **Is the trade-off material enough to CONFIRM WITH THE USER?** A material trade-off is the user's call, never yours. **MATERIAL** when ANY holds: irreversible / one-way door (data migration, public contract, storage format, vendor lock-in) · cost shifted onto someone else (another team, ops/on-call, future maintainer, end user) · one quality attribute traded for another (correctness↔speed, security↔convenience, latency↔cost, simplicity↔flexibility) · a boundary crossed (client↔server tier, service contract, event contract, shared library) · a high-consequence path (auth, money, data integrity, breaking change, High/Medium residual risk) · the worth-it verdict is UNCLEAR.
>
> **MATERIAL → STOP and confirm via `AskUserQuestion` BEFORE the verdict stands** — state the trade-off, both options, what each sacrifices, and your recommendation. **NOT material →** record it inline with a one-line justification and proceed.
>
> **Non-asking execution contexts — ESCALATE BY HANDOFF, never by silence.** `AskUserQuestion` reaches only the main interactive agent: a sub-agent cannot ask the user, and a terminal/verdict-only mode asks nothing by design. When you are running in such a context, the obligation is **redirected, never waived** — do ALL of: (a) complete questions 1 and 2 normally; (b) decide materiality and record it in the Trade-Off Assessment row with `confirmed? = NO — cannot ask from this context`; (c) **name the unconfirmed MATERIAL trade-off explicitly in your returned summary/verdict so the CALLER (or parent orchestrator) escalates it via `AskUserQuestion` on your behalf** — a material trade-off mentioned only inside a report file on disk is NOT a handoff; (d) do not emit an unqualified PASS — mark the verdict as carrying an unconfirmed material trade-off, so the caller's gate stays closed until the user answers. The caller inherits the escalation duty the moment it reads your return.
>
> This carve-out is about **reachability, not convenience**: it applies ONLY where the tool genuinely cannot reach the user (spawned sub-agent, terminal validate/verdict-only mode, non-interactive/headless run). It is NEVER a licence to skip the question, to self-approve a one-way door, or to downgrade materiality because asking is inconvenient — if you CAN ask, you MUST ask.
>
> **Emit a Trade-Off Assessment row** per reviewed decision and per recommendation: `| decision | sacrifices | gain (metric) | who pays, when | WORTH IT/NOT/UNCLEAR | material? | confirmed? |`.
>
> **BLOCKED until:** trade-off named (or dimensions-checked justification given) · worth-it verdict emitted · materiality decided · every MATERIAL trade-off either confirmed with the user OR — in a non-asking context — handed off in the returned verdict for the caller to confirm. A MATERIAL trade-off that is neither confirmed nor handed off can NEVER be PASS, and NEVER gets buried as a Low-severity note.
>
> **NEVER** answer "no trade-off" without checking · decide a material trade-off silently on the user's behalf · let convergence/delivery pressure authorize walking through a one-way door · bundle several material trade-offs into one vague "proceed?".

The 2-repeated-no-progress blocker rule is an earlier exit — escalate at whichever trips first. NEVER loop open-ended.

<!-- /SYNC:double-round-trip-review:reminder -->


<!-- SYNC:goal-contract-satisfaction-loop:reminder -->

- **MANDATORY** Resolve the active Goal Contract BEFORE work (active plan `goal.md` → `plans/goals/{YYMMDD-HHmm}-{slug}/goal.md` → create from current request) and read saved success criteria before editing.
- **MANDATORY** Append iteration evidence after execution; emit a Goal Satisfaction matrix (PASS/FAIL/BLOCKED) before reporting PASS; loop on validated FAIL; escalate repeated no-progress or blockers. NEVER store secrets in goal files.

<!-- /SYNC:goal-contract-satisfaction-loop:reminder -->

<!-- SYNC:trade-off-interrogation-gate:reminder -->

- **MANDATORY MUST ATTENTION ALWAYS ASK THE 3 TRADE-OFF QUESTIONS** — on the thing under review AND on every recommendation you make: (1) **is there any trade-off?** name what it SACRIFICES (change cost · complexity · perf · coupling · reversibility · migration · ops load · blast radius · security · testability · delivery time · UX) — "none"/"pure win" is an unfinished analysis, so state the dimensions checked; (2) **is it worth it?** gain (with a metric) vs cost, WHO pays, WHEN → emit **WORTH IT / NOT WORTH IT / UNCLEAR**; NOT WORTH IT → withdraw or replace it; (3) **is it material enough to confirm with the user?** irreversible/one-way door · cost shifted onto another team/ops/maintainer/user · one quality attribute traded for another · a tier/service/event/library boundary crossed · auth/money/data-integrity/breaking-change/High-or-Medium-risk path · verdict UNCLEAR → **STOP and confirm via `AskUserQuestion` BEFORE the verdict**.
- **MANDATORY** A MATERIAL trade-off with no user confirmation can NEVER be PASS; NEVER bury one as a Low-severity note, NEVER decide it silently, and NEVER let delivery or convergence pressure authorize a one-way door. — why: an un-walked-back one-way door is the user's call to make, not the reviewer's.
- **MANDATORY — non-asking contexts escalate BY HANDOFF, never by silence.** `AskUserQuestion` reaches only the main interactive agent: a sub-agent cannot ask the user, and a terminal/verdict-only mode asks nothing by design. There the duty is REDIRECTED, not waived — still name the trade-off, still decide materiality, record `confirmed? = NO — cannot ask from this context`, **state the unconfirmed MATERIAL trade-off in your RETURNED verdict/summary so the CALLER escalates it** (a note only in an on-disk report is not a handoff), and never emit an unqualified PASS. Applies ONLY where the user is genuinely unreachable (spawned sub-agent, terminal validate mode, headless run) — if you CAN ask, you MUST ask.

<!-- SYNC:parallel-subagent-dispatch -->

> **Parallel Sub-Agent Dispatch** — Plan parallelism the moment a task breakdown exists, BEFORE executing it — running provably independent tasks sequentially wastes wall-clock. Applies to every multi-step job: workflow steps, planning, batch updates, investigation, research, scans, reviews, doc sync. **Plan execution is metadata-gated, NEVER default-parallel** — fan-out follows ONLY what the plan declares (`PAR`/`SEQ` tags + per-phase write set); an untagged plan runs sequentially — why: a derived write set cannot see cascade or generated writes.
>
> 1. **Tag every task `PAR` or `SEQ`.** `PAR` = inputs exclude every pending task's output AND write set disjoint from every other `PAR`. Else `SEQ` — MUST ATTENTION name the dependency forcing it.
> 2. **Group `PAR` into waves.** No edge between members. Two writers of one file NEVER share a wave. Read-only work (search, investigation, review, research) parallelizes freely.
> 3. **Declare before dispatch:** `Parallel plan: wave 1 = [...] · wave 2 = [...] · SEQ = [...] (reason)`.
> 4. **Spawn each wave in ONE message** — every `Agent` call in one response, NEVER dripped per turn. Route each task to its specialist (`.claude/skills/shared/sub-agent-selection-guide.md`); NEVER `code-reviewer` as catch-all.
> 5. **Brief each sub-agent self-contained:** goal · scope + owned files · reference docs · return contract (summary + `Full report:` path, per SYNC:subagent-return-contract) · incremental persistence to `plans/reports/` (per SYNC:incremental-persistence).
> 6. **Barrier per wave.** Advance ONLY after EVERY member returns (a skipped conditional counts as returned). Merge, mark each task completed/skipped, THEN dispatch the next wave. Mutating steps wait for the barrier.
> 7. **One level deep.** A dispatched sub-agent executes its own brief; further fan-out stays the orchestrator's job unless that agent's `.claude/agents/*.md` definition authorizes it.
>
> **NEVER parallelize:** tasks sharing a write target · a task consuming a pending task's output · trivial single-file work (dispatch overhead > gain) · an order a workflow explicitly fixes · gates awaiting user approval.
>
> **Blocked until:** MUST ATTENTION every task tagged PAR/SEQ with a named reason per SEQ · waves declared + write-set disjointness checked · each wave spawned in ONE message · barrier honored before the next wave.

<!-- /SYNC:parallel-subagent-dispatch -->

<!-- SYNC:parallel-subagent-dispatch:reminder -->

- **MANDATORY** After planning tasks, tag each PAR/SEQ and spawn every PAR wave as parallel sub-agents in ONE message — default parallel for workflows, batch updates, investigation, research, reviews; plan execution fans out ONLY on what the plan declares.
- **MANDATORY** Disjoint write sets per wave · all-return barrier before the next wave · specialist routing · sub-agents NEVER fan out further unless their own agent definition authorizes it.

## Closing Reminders

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION Goal:** Ensure frontend/UI changes survive real content, responsive layouts, layering, and styling conventions before handoff.

**Protocols in force (concise digest of the SYNC/shared blocks this skill carries — MUST ATTENTION honor each canonical body above):**

- **Graph-Assisted Investigation:** Run graph command on key files first.
- **Nested Task Creation:** Expand child phases; link parent when nested.
- **Project Reference Docs Guide:** Read project docs before reviewing.
- **Task Tracking External Report:** Track tasks; persist findings incrementally.
- **Subagent Return Contract:** Sub-agent returns summary plus report path.
- **Critical Thinking Mindset:** Traced proof per claim; never guess.
- **Sequential Thinking Protocol:** Multi-step reasoning; state confidence closer.
- **Evidence-Based Reasoning:** Cite `file:line`; >80% to act.
- **Design Patterns Quality:** DRY, layered responsibility, SOLID; grep dangling.
- **Double Round-Trip Review:** Validate, fix, full re-review until clean.
- **Source-Test Drift Check:** Source changes; inspect affected tests.
- **Understand Code First:** Read code, grep 3+, before changing.
- **AI Mistake Prevention:** verify generated content against evidence, trace downstream references, verify all affected outputs, re-read after context loss, surface ambiguity.
- **Systematic Review Batching:** Large changeset; parallel size-capped batches.
- **Severity Rubric:** Classify by consequence; NEVER pass Critical/High.
- **Category Review Thinking:** Derive concerns first-principles, never fixed checklist.
- **Parallel Sub-Agent Dispatch:** Tag tasks PAR/SEQ, group PAR into disjoint-write-set waves, spawn each wave in ONE message, barrier before advancing.

**MUST ATTENTION** break work into small tasks using `TaskCreate` BEFORE starting
**MUST ATTENTION** resolve and read project UI/styling docs BEFORE reviewing — rules come from docs, not general knowledge
**MUST ATTENTION** SKIP this skill when no files match the project frontend path/extension patterns
**MUST ATTENTION** every violation requires `file:line` proof — NEVER speculate
**MUST ATTENTION** grep 3+ counterexamples before flagging any pattern violation
**MUST ATTENTION** `z-index` with `!important` and chained BEM modifiers are HARD-GATE BLOCKED
**MUST ATTENTION** NEVER mix incompatible project token systems in one file — recommend whichever system the file already imports/uses
**MUST ATTENTION** after validated UI fixes, rerun the full UI review; when that protocol uses a fresh reviewer, use the UI/UX-specialized sub-agent from the local sub-agent selection guide
**MUST ATTENTION** run at least ONE graph command on key files when graph.db exists
**MUST ATTENTION** NEVER fix code — review and report only
**MUST ATTENTION** apply `Think:` reasoning prompt before checking each category — derive violations, don't recite checklists
**MUST ATTENTION** use `AskUserQuestion` to present next steps after completing review

| "Already read the docs"                   | Show the extracted rule (mixin name, token name) — no recall = no read.                 |
| "Just flag obvious z-index literals"      | Gray areas matter most. Trace the surface's semantic layer before recommending a token. |
| "Fixed width is fine, it looks right"     | Looks right at 1440px ≠ usable at 320px. Apply the flex/min-max decision rule.          |
| "web-design-guidelines already covers UI" | That is a11y/UX, not the project styling gate. Different scope — do both.               |
