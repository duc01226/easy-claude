> **Root Cause Debugging** — Systematic approach, never guess-and-check.
>
> 1. **Reproduce** — Confirm the issue exists with evidence (error message, stack trace, screenshot)
> 2. **Rule the environment in or out** — Sweep environment preconditions (versions, dependency/install state, config & env vars, service dependencies, ports/network/clock, permissions, leftover state) AND resource/transience suspects (RAM/OOM, CPU saturation, disk/inode/temp, handle & pool limits, timeouts that are really slowness) BEFORE deep code tracing. The environment is a competing hypothesis, not a fallback — see `SYNC:environment-fault-hypothesis`.
> 3. **Isolate** — Narrow to specific file/function/line using binary search + graph trace
> 4. **Trace** — Follow data flow from input to failure point. Read actual code, don't infer.
> 5. **Hypothesize** — Form theory with confidence %. State what evidence supports/contradicts it. Keep the environment hypothesis in the matrix until evidence rules it out.
> 6. **Verify** — Test hypothesis with targeted grep/read. One variable at a time.
> 7. **Fix** — Address root cause, not symptoms. Verify fix doesn't break callers via graph `connections`. An environment cause is fixed in the environment or setup — never by editing product code or tests to absorb it.
>
> **NEVER:** Guess without evidence. Fix symptoms instead of cause. Skip reproduction step. Assume a failure is a code defect before the environment is ruled out.
