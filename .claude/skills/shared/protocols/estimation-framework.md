> **Estimation Framework** — Bottom-up first; SP DERIVED; output min-max range when likely ≥3d. Stack-agnostic. Baseline: 3-5yr dev, 6 productive hrs/day. AI estimate assumes Claude Code + project context.
>
> **Method:**
>
> 1. **Blast Radius pass** (below) — drives code AND test cost
> 2. Decompose phases → hours/phase → `bottom_up_hours = Σ phase_hours`
> 3. `likely_days = ceil(bottom_up_hours / 6) × productivity_factor`
> 4. Sum **Risk Margin** (base + add-ons) → `max_days = likely_days × (1 + margin)`
> 5. `min_days = likely_days × 0.9`
> 6. Output as range when `likely_days ≥3`; single point allowed `<3` (still record margin)
> 7. `man_days_ai` = same range × AI speedup
> 8. `story_points` DERIVED from `likely_days` via SP-Days — NEVER driver. Disagreement >50% → trust bottom-up
>
> **Productivity factor:** 0.8 strong scaffolding+codegen+AI hooks · 1.0 mature default · 1.2 weak patterns · 1.5 greenfield
>
> **Cost Driver Heuristic (apply BEFORE work-type row):**
>
> - **UI dominates** in CRUD/business apps — 1.5-3x backend (states, validation, responsive, a11y, polish)
> - **Backend dominates ONLY:** multi-aggregate invariants, cross-service contracts, schema migrations, heavy query/perf, new event flows

> - `likely_days ≥3d` and single-point? → reject, must be range
> - Margin <15% on `likely_days ≥5d`? → under-estimated, widen

> - Purely additive on existing model AND existing UI? → cap SP 3 unless tests >1.5d
> - NEW UI surface (page/complex form/dashboard)? → SP 5+ even if backend one endpoint
> - Backend cross-service / migration / multi-aggregate? → SP 8+ regardless of UI
> - `bottom_up_hours / 6` vs SP-Days disagreement >50%? → trust bottom-up, downgrade SP
