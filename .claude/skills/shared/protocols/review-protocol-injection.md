> **Review Protocol Injection** — Fresh reviewer prompts MUST embed 11 protocol blocks VERBATIM, copied WHOLESALE; these are review-tier renderings. When canonical `SYNC:` protocols change, update their renderings here in the same edit. Copy this template into the Agent `prompt`; replace only `{placeholders}` in Task / Round / Reference Docs / Target Files / Output. Never alter embedded sections at dispatch.
>
> **Why inline expansion:** Fresh reviewers need every rule immediately; file pointers/placeholders depend on reads or hooks that may not fire. The hybrid policy (`SYNC:shared-protocol-duplication-policy`) therefore retains all 11 full bodies in this template, copied wholesale.

### Subagent Type Selection

- `code-reviewer` — for code reviews (reviewing source files, git diffs, implementation)
- `general-purpose` — for plan / doc / artifact reviews (reviewing markdown plans, docs, specs)

### Canonical Agent Call Template (Copy Verbatim)

```
Agent({
  description: "Fresh Round {N} review",
  subagent_type: "code-reviewer",
  prompt: `
## Task
{review-specific task — e.g., "Review all uncommitted changes for code quality" | "Review plan files under {plan-dir}" | "Review integration tests in {path}"}

## Round
Round {N}; ZERO prior-round memory. Re-read every target with your own tools. Trust no main-agent information beyond this prompt.

## Protocols (follow VERBATIM — these are non-negotiable)

### Spec ↔ Tests ↔ Code Triangulation
FIRST review the WHOLE PACKAGE. Read `docs/project-config.json`: valid `specArtifacts` profiles select configured `intent/contracts/evidence` roles, identifiers, ownership and test-carrier dialects; only absent profiles use strict-default §3 ACs / §4 BRs / §5 invariants / §8 TCs. Malformed/unsupported declarations are `BLOCKED`, never absent/fallback. Load governing artifact, tests, and changed code TOGETHER; judge mutual consistency before isolated checks.
1. Locate canonical owner sections, guarding tests, and implementing code. Native profiles: preserve owner path + case/scenario ID + optional variant; resolve configured carriers to actual tests. Missing faces are findings (SPEC-GAP / TEST-GAP / DEAD-SPEC).
2. Triangulate pairwise; log every disagreement and classify its wrong face:
   - code vs spec: behavior absent from configured `intent/contracts` (or strict-default §3/§4/§5/§8) → CODE-EXTRA or SPEC-STALE; a hard contract/invariant with no enforcing path → CODE-WRONG.
   - tests vs spec: native case without executing assertions, or assertions absent from native rules/cases → TEST-GAP or SPEC-SILENT. Without `specArtifacts`, check strict-default §8 TCs.
   - tests vs code: uncovered changed path → TEST-GAP; test passing a deliberately broken invariant → WEAK-TEST (apply the mutation thinking in Bug Detection).
3. Hidden-rule capture: enforced but unstated invariants (SPEC-SILENT) MUST become findings, additions to configured `intent`/`contracts`, and `evidence` links to native cases with inspected executing assertions. Without profiles, use strict-default §3/§4/§5/§8 and TC. Enrich; never silently pass.
4. Proceed only after agreement or all disagreements are logged; re-review enriched spec/test packages.
NEVER PASS unlogged spec/test/code disagreements. Diff = entry point; package = judgment unit.

### Evidence-Based Reasoning
Speculation FORBIDDEN; prove every claim.
1. Every claim: cite file:line, grep results, or framework docs
2. Confidence: >80% act freely; 60-80% verify first; <60% DO NOT recommend
3. Cross-service validation required for architectural changes
4. Insufficient evidence is valid/expected output
BLOCKED until: Evidence file path (file:line) provided; Grep search performed; 3+ similar patterns found; Confidence level stated.
Forbidden without proof: "obviously", "I think", "should be", "probably", "this is because".
If incomplete → output: "Insufficient evidence. Verified: [...]. Not verified: [...]."

### Bug Detection
MUST check categories 1-4 for EVERY review. Never skip.
1. Null Safety: Can params/returns be null? Are they guarded? Optional chaining gaps? .find() returns checked?
2. Boundary Conditions: Off-by-one (< vs <=)? Empty collections handled? Zero/negative values? Max limits?
3. Error Handling: Try-catch scope correct? Silent swallowed exceptions? Error types specific? Cleanup in finally?
4. Resource Management: Connections/streams closed? Subscriptions unsubscribed on destroy? Timers cleared? Memory bounded?
5. Concurrency (if async): Missing await? Race conditions on shared state? Stale closures? Retry storms?
6. Stack-Specific: Check the configured language/runtime pitfalls and framework-specific failure modes discovered from local code.
Admit a finding only with a reachable trigger path (the caller, input or state that reaches the defect) and a consequence; a concern no supported path reaches is an observation, and unsettled reachability is `NOT VERIFIABLE` only when the concern would be MEDIUM or higher.
Classify every finding by consequence (never by effort): CRITICAL = immediate material security/safety/data-loss risk or failed binary gate → block; HIGH = material correctness, contract, privacy, or authority risk → must fix; MEDIUM = bounded consequential edge/resilience/maintainability gap → must clear the current round, or escalate with an explicit residual-risk follow-up that does not create a clean pass; LOW = non-blocking polish with no credible present impact → record/defer from round 2; `NOT VERIFIABLE` is unresolved evidence, not LOW.

### Design Patterns Quality
Every code change:
1. Consistency/reuse: follow documented patterns; justify extraction cost by repetition or real consumer need. Similar names alone never require shared bases.
2. Responsibility: follow config/references/accepted decisions/code; place behavior with its owner. Assume no entity/service/controller hierarchy or forbidden layer without evidence.
3. Apply cohesion/coupling/dependency principles where paradigm assumptions fit; SOLID suits OO boundaries, not every language/codebase.
4. After extraction/move/rename: Grep ENTIRE scope for dangling references. Zero tolerance.
5. YAGNI: repetition prompts evaluation, never numeric extraction thresholds. Extract when shared change reasons, real consumers, or evidenced ownership/substitution lower total change cost; no hypothetical-use patterns.
6. Purpose naming: public/cross-layer abstractions name consumer capability/domain/contract, not provider/SDK/framework/database/transport. `IStorage`/`Storage` → `AzureBlobStorage`; use `IAzureStorage` only when Azure-specific semantics are intentionally part of the contract.
7. Contract-fit: read callers/all implementations; narrow over-broad abstractions (`IObjectStore`, `DocumentStore`), never reward misleading generic names.
8. Naming signals: `Manager`, `Helper`, `Utils`, `Data`, `Thing`, `Service`, `Interface`, type decorations/unexplained abbreviations are defects only when hiding purpose/scope/responsibility.
9. Concrete names: provider/strategy/transport/test-double names may distinguish real behavior (`AzureBlobStorage`, `InMemoryStorage`, `RetryingStorage`); exclude from caller contracts unless promised.
10. Preserve local interface syntax/naming: `.NET` `I` prefixes and Google TypeScript unmarked interfaces are both valid.
Anti-patterns to flag: God Object, Copy-Paste inheritance, Circular Dependency, Leaky Abstraction.

### Logic & Intention Review
Verify behavior matches change intent.
1. Every changed file MUST serve stated purpose; flag unrelated scope creep.
2. Trace one complete success scenario through changed code.
3. Trace one failure/edge scenario through changed code.
4. With plan context, map every acceptance criterion to code.
5. Test/spec changes: tests name protected business rule/invariant and fail when it breaks.
6. Migration exclusion: no migration-code tests; schema/data migrations are one-time paths, not core application logic.
NEVER PASS without both happy/error traces.

### Test Spec Verification
Map changed code to test specs.
1. Discover test/spec format in docs, test cases, BDD features, or spec folders.
2. Every changed path MUST map to a test case/spec or be flagged "needs test case".
3. New functions/endpoints/handlers → test-spec creation flag.
4. Exclude migrations from test/spec creation: one-time execution, not core application logic.
5. Verify existing spec evidence resolves actual code (file:line); flag stale references.
6. Meaningful cases name business intent/invariants; flag implementation-mirroring behavior-only cases.
7. Auth/data changes → verify corresponding authorization and data-state test cases exist.
8. Missing changed-path specs → log gap, recommend project test-spec workflow.
NEVER skip test mapping; uncovered paths risk production bugs.

### Behavioral Delta Matrix
MANDATORY for any bugfix review. Produce input-state × pre-fix × post-fix × delta table BEFORE writing verdict.
- Minimum 3 rows; include at least one row OUTSIDE the original bug report.
- Any "REGRESSION" delta → review returns FAIL until a preservation test is added.
- Narrative descriptions do NOT substitute for the matrix.
Example rows (external-record sync fix):
| Input                 | Pre-fix | Post-fix                  | Delta      |
| --------------------- | ------- | ------------------------- | ---------- |
| Record exists (valid) | Reused  | Always recreated → orphan | REGRESSION |
| Record missing (404)  | Error   | Recreated                 | Fixed      |

### Fix-Layer Accountability
Trace execution/data flow; fix the violated contract's owner, never assume the crash site.
MANDATORY before ANY fix:
1. Trace actual origin, transformations, boundaries, failure; invent no absent layers.
2. Identify invalid-state/behavior contract owner from architecture/code evidence.
3. Fix authoritative owner; retain untrusted-boundary validation. Justify multi-file fixes by owned contracts, not file-count thresholds.
4. Inspect relevant existing bypass entries: constructors/adapters/parsers/caches/persistence.
BLOCKED until: The affected path is traced; the owner is supported by file:line evidence; relevant consumers and bypass paths are checked; and the correction point fits the project's architecture.
Anti-patterns (REJECT): assuming the symptom site is the owner; scattering workarounds without tracing the contract; assuming the lowest technical layer is always authoritative; removing validation from a real trust boundary to force a single correction point.

### Rationalization Prevention
AI skips steps via these evasions. Recognize and reject:
- "Too simple for a plan" → Simple + wrong assumptions = wasted time. Plan anyway.
- "I'll test after" → RED before GREEN. Write/verify test first.
- "Already searched" → Show grep evidence with file:line. No proof = no search.
- "Just do it" → Still need TaskCreate. Skip depth, never skip tracking.
- "Just a small fix" → Small fix in wrong location cascades. Verify file:line first.
- "Code is self-explanatory" → Future readers need evidence trail. Document anyway.
- "Combine steps to save time" → Combined steps dilute focus. Each step has distinct purpose.

### Graph-Assisted Investigation (optional advice)
Optional: for high-risk blast radius (shared contract/many callers/cross-module/cross-service/public API), .code-graph/graph.db suggests callers/dependents/impacted tests. Treat it as a hint, NOT proof: stale/incomplete graphs lag uncommitted edits/unindexed paths. Verify important results by files/grep; skip low-risk/local changes. An absent or stale graph is never a finding.
Pattern: grep/read → optional graph suggestions → grep/read verification.
- High-risk investigation: trace --direction both on 2-3 entry files
- Fix/debug with wide reach: callers_of on buggy function + tests_for
- Feature touching a shared contract: connections on files to be modified
- Review of a high-risk change: tests_for on changed functions
- Blast radius: trace --direction downstream
CLI: python .claude/scripts/code_graph {command} --json. Use --node-mode file first (10-30x less noise), then --node-mode function for detail.

### Understand Code First
HARD-GATE: Do NOT write, plan, or fix until you READ existing code.
1. Search 3+ similar patterns (grep/glob) — cite file:line evidence.
2. Read existing files in target area — understand structure, base classes, conventions.
3. Optional high-risk hints: python .claude/scripts/code_graph trace <file> --direction both --json if .code-graph/graph.db exists; verify stale-capable caller/dependent hints by files.
4. Map dependents by grep/read callers; optional graph connections/callers_of adds hints.
5. Write investigation to tmp/analysis/ for non-trivial tasks (3+ files).
6. Re-read analysis file before implementing — never work from memory alone.
7. NEVER invent new patterns when existing ones work — match exactly or document deviation.
BLOCKED until: Read target files; Grep 3+ patterns; Assumptions verified with evidence. (The code graph is optional advice, never a gate.)

## Reference Docs (READ before reviewing)
Read only lane-resolved docs; do not re-resolve the whole set.
- `code-review-rules.md`, inside the reference-docs root (default `docs/project-reference`; a `docsRoots.projectReference.path` entry in `docs/project-config.json` overrides the path)
- {lane-specific docs the orchestrator resolved — e.g., the pattern doc for the files under review, integration-test-reference.md for a test lane, the governing spec for a spec-compliance lane}

## Target Files
{explicit file list OR "run git diff to see uncommitted changes" OR "read all files under {plan-dir}"}

## Output
Write a structured report to tmp/reports/{review-type}-round{N}-{date}.md with sections:
- Status: PASS | FAIL
- Issue Count: {number}
- Critical Issues (with file:line evidence)
- High Priority Issues (with file:line evidence)
- Medium / Low Issues
- Cross-cutting findings

Return the report path and status to the main agent.
Every finding MUST have file:line evidence. Speculation is forbidden.

### Rules

- DO copy the template wholesale — including all 11 embedded protocol sections
- DO replace only the `{placeholders}` in Task / Round / Reference Docs / Target Files / Output sections with context-specific content
- DO choose `code-reviewer` subagent_type for code reviews and `general-purpose` for plan / doc / artifact reviews
- DO NOT paraphrase, summarize, or skip any protocol section
- DO NOT pass file contents inline — the sub-agent reads via its own tool calls so it has a fresh context
- DO NOT reference protocols by file path or tag name — the bodies are already embedded above
- DO NOT introduce placeholder markers for the protocols — they must stay literally expanded
