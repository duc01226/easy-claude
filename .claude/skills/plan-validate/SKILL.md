## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Force every assumption-laden plan decision and every preservation-critical behavior through explicit user confirmation BEFORE implementation — by interviewing the user with critical questions that validate assumptions and surface issues — so no unstated assumption silently reaches code.

**Summary:**

- **Purpose:** validate a finished plan via a critical-questions interview so every assumption-laden decision and every preservation-critical behavior is user-confirmed BEFORE implementation — no unstated assumption silently reaches code.
- **Main steps (run in order):** Phase 0 Detect Plan Type → resolve plan path (`$ARGUMENTS` / `## Plan Context` / ask) → load `mode` + `questions` range as hard constraints → Phase 0.5 resolve Applicability / Plan Gate → Step 1 Read `plan.md` + all `phase-*.md`, flag decisions/assumptions/risks/tradeoffs → Step 2 Extract topics across 9 categories (Applicability, Architecture, Assumptions, Tradeoffs, Risks, Scope, New Tech/Lib, Test Specs, Preservation) → Step 3 Generate questions (2-4 concrete options each, surface implicit decisions) → Step 4 Interview via `AskUserQuestion` (≤4 per call) → Step 5 Document answers → offer implement/refine/skip.
- **Phase 0 weights everything:** plan type (bugfix/feature/migration/refactor/other) decides which question categories fire; any fix/bug/regression/broken/defect keyword makes the Preservation question BLOCKING — never skip it.
- **The output is a REAL interview, not a self-answer:** honor the `questions` MIN-MAX range from `## Plan Context`, give 2-4 concrete options per question, treat the Preservation "Unsure" answer as BLOCKED → route to `/plan`; if the plan adds new tech/packages, probe whether alternatives were evaluated before accepting the choice.
- **Persist results narrowly:** add ONLY a `## Validation Summary` (confirmed decisions + action items) to `plan.md` — NEVER edit phase files; close by offering implement/refine/skip via `AskUserQuestion`.
- **Applicability is mandatory for every plan:** read `.claude/skills/shared/product-roadmap-contract.md`, verify the plan's branch-specific `## Plan Gate`, and ask the owner to confirm the embedded slice/decomposition, explicit roadmap outcome, framework technical outcome, or EXEMPT boundary plus non-goals, scenario proof, commands, evidence, and approval. `BLOCKED`, `OPEN`, `MISSING`, or `REQUIRED` cannot be silently upgraded.

**Workflow:**

1. **Detect Plan Type** — Classify plan (bugfix/feature/migration/refactor) to weight question categories
2. **Read Plan** — Parse plan.md + phase files for decisions, assumptions, risks
3. **Extract Topics** — Scan architecture, assumptions, tradeoffs, risks, scope keywords
4. **Generate Questions** — Formulate concrete questions with 2-4 options each
5. **Interview User** — Present questions using configured count range
6. **Document Answers** — Add Validation Summary section to plan.md

**Key Rules:**

- MUST ATTENTION use `AskUserQuestion` — NEVER auto-decide on behalf of user — why: the user owns every assumption-laden choice, not the agent
- Ask ONLY about genuine choices affecting implementation — NEVER about non-decision points — why: noise questions burn the interview budget and erode trust
- Bugfix plans ALWAYS trigger the Preservation question (keywords: fix, bug, regression, broken, defect) — why: an unverified preserved-correctness invariant is a silent regression
- Persist via a `## Validation Summary` on `plan.md` — NEVER modify phase files — why: phase files are the plan's source of truth; validation is a read-then-annotate pass
- For embedded, explicit-roadmap, framework/library, or EXEMPT plans, include the final applicability status and exact owning paths in that same summary; use each branch only when the plan records its required evidence and owner.

## First Principle — Easy to Change

> **Success metric for every coding decision: _future change cost._** DRY, SRP,
> abstraction, design patterns, naming, layering, and tests serve one goal:
> **make the next change cheaper**.

When evaluating code, refactors, tests, abstractions, or questions, ask:
**does this make the next change cheaper or more expensive?**

- Reject "best practices" that raise change cost: premature abstraction,
  speculative generality, leaky indirection, ceremony without payoff.
- Name real enemies: **coupling, hidden state, duplicated knowledge, unclear
  intent, irreversible decisions exposed too early**.
- Prefer simple designs easy to change over sophisticated designs that are not.

Apply this lens before downstream rules; if a rule raises change cost, this
principle wins.

## Phase 0: Detect Plan Type

Classify plan type BEFORE generating questions; it drives category weighting:

| Plan Type     | Detection                                                         | Mandatory Extra Categories            |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Bugfix**    | Title/frontmatter: `fix`, `bug`, `regression`, `broken`, `defect` | Preservation (BLOCKING)               |
| **Feature**   | New capability, no fix keywords                                   | Architecture, Assumptions, Test Specs |
| **Migration** | Schema change, EF migration, data move                            | Risks, Preservation, Scope            |
| **Refactor**  | Restructure/clean up, no behavior change                          | Preservation, Tradeoffs               |
| **Other**     | None of above                                                     | Architecture, Scope                   |

**Bugfix detection is BLOCKING** — NEVER skip Preservation question when fix/bug/regression/broken/defect keywords present.

## Plan Resolution

1. `$ARGUMENTS` provided → use that path
2. Else use the active path from `## Plan Context`
3. No plan → ask user for a path or run `/plan` first

## Phase 0.5: Applicability / Plan Gate

Before extracting technical questions, classify the plan's branch.

- Embedded large-idea: read the owning PBI/spec; verify complete `large_idea_decomposition`, selected slice, non-goals/deferred owners, and conditional scenario artifact when needed. Do not require the product roadmap (default `docs/product-roadmap.md`; a `docsRoots.productRoadmap.path` entry in `docs/project-config.json` overrides the path) or a product milestone.
- Explicit roadmap: read the product roadmap (default `docs/product-roadmap.md`; a `docsRoots.productRoadmap.path` entry in `docs/project-config.json` overrides the path), selected milestone scope brief, and `scenario-analysis.md`.
- Framework/library: read technical scope, operational scenarios, generated-carrier evidence, and commands.
- Verify one `## Plan Gate` in `plan.md`: matching branch/outcome/boundaries; explicit non-goals; lifecycle terms when applicable; branch decision state; known or explicitly inapplicable skeleton/configuration; build/test/run commands; redacted evidence; `Human approval: APPROVED`.
- Missing upstream artifacts or `BLOCKED`/`OPEN`/`MISSING`/`REQUIRED` values create a blocking Applicability question. Do not implement or recommend `implement` while unresolved.
- Isolated brownfield/bugfix: verify the shared contract's EXEMPT branch: scope brief and plan reason/owner, required sibling scenario, explicit `EXEMPT` roadmap/milestone, explicit `N/A` product-decision rationale, known commands/evidence/approval. Retain preservation/spec/test/review questions.

## Configuration (from injected context)

Check `## Plan Context` section:

- `mode` — auto/prompt/off
- `questions` — MIN-MAX range (e.g. `3-8`)

Treat both as hard constraints.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Read Plan Files

Read plan directory:

- `plan.md` — overview + phases list
- `phase-*.md` — all phase files
- Flag: decision points, assumptions, risks, tradeoffs

### Step 2: Extract Question Topics

| Category         | Keywords                                                                                   |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Architecture** | approach, pattern, design, structure, database, API                                        |
| **Assumptions**  | assume, expect, should, will, must, default                                                |
| **Tradeoffs**    | tradeoff, vs, alternative, option, choice, either/or                                       |
| **Risks**        | risk, might, could fail, dependency, blocker, concern                                      |
| **Scope**        | phase, MVP, future, out of scope, nice to have                                             |
| **New Tech/Lib** | install, add package, new dependency, npm install, dotnet add, unfamiliar framework names  |
| **Test Specs**   | TC-, test case, coverage, TDD, test specification                                          |
| **Preservation** | auto-trigger on bugfix keywords in title/frontmatter — scan Preservation Inventory section |
| **Product Readiness** | roadmap-applicable or EXEMPT plan — scan the applicable `## Plan Gate` branch, scope/scenario refs, non-goals, definitions, evidence, and human approval |

### Step 3: Generate Questions

**Format rules:**

- 2-4 concrete options per question
- Mark recommended with "(Recommended)" suffix
- "Other" option automatic — do NOT add
- Surface implicit decisions

For a roadmap-applicable plan, ask a Product Readiness question before lower-level choices:

> Does the plan implement the owning slice/outcome or technical boundary exactly, with the stated non-goals, lifecycle definitions where applicable, scenario proof, known skeleton/commands, redacted evidence, and human approval?

Offer concrete choices such as: **Yes, approve the Plan Gate (Recommended)**; **No, revise the scope/plan**; **A product decision remains open**; **This plan is an explicitly accepted isolated-change exemption**. Never answer this question from the plan author's confidence alone.

**Examples:**

```
Category: Architecture
Question: "How should validation results be persisted?"
Options:
1. Save to plan.md frontmatter (Recommended) — updates existing plan
2. Create validation-answers.md — separate answers file
3. Don't persist — ephemeral validation only
```

```
Category: Assumptions
Question: "Plan assumes API rate limiting not needed. Correct?"
Options:
1. Yes, not needed for MVP
2. No, add basic rate limiting now (Recommended)
3. Defer to Phase 2
```

```
Category: Preservation (MANDATORY when title/frontmatter: fix, bug, regression, broken, defect)
Question: "List 2-3 inputs where CURRENT code is correct. Will fix change behavior on any?"
Options (multi-select):
1. "Current code correct on: {input A}. Fix preserves behavior." (Recommended)
2. "Current code correct on: {input B}. Fix CHANGES behavior because: {justification}"
3. "Current code has NO preserved-correctness inputs — every input was broken" (rare; requires confirmation)
4. "Unsure — need to investigate" (STOP: run /plan preservation analysis)
```

**Follow-up rules:**

- Option 2 selected → `plan.md` Preservation Inventory MUST cite Preservation TC asserting new behavior is intended
- Option 4 selected → return BLOCKED status, recommend `/plan` before proceeding
- Option 3 selected → `AskUserQuestion` follow-up: "Confirm: current code has NO preserved invariant? [Yes, every input broken / No, missed some — re-investigate]"

### Step 4: Interview User

Use `AskUserQuestion` — NEVER skip or auto-answer.

**Rules:**

- Use question count from `## Plan Context` → `Validation: mode=X, questions=MIN-MAX`
- Group related questions (max 4 per tool call)
- Focus: assumptions, risks, tradeoffs, architecture
- MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION: if plan introduces new tech/packages, ask: "Plan uses {lib}. Were alternatives evaluated? Confirm choice or research more?"

### Step 5: Document Answers

Add `## Validation Summary` to `plan.md`:

```markdown
## Validation Summary

**Validated:** {date}
**Questions asked:** {count}

### Applicability

- **Branch:** DECOMPOSITION-EMBEDDED | EXPLICIT-ROADMAP | FRAMEWORK-LIBRARY | EXEMPT | BLOCKED
- **Owning artifact / roadmap:** `{paths}` or `NOT APPLICABLE — embedded/framework/EXEMPT`
- **Slice / milestone / technical outcome:** `{ID and outcome}`
- **Scope handoff / scenarios:** `{paths or conditional N/A}`
- **Plan Gate:** DECOMPOSITION-EMBEDDED | READY | FRAMEWORK-LIBRARY | EXEMPT | BLOCKED
- **Human approval:** APPROVED | REQUIRED

### Confirmed Decisions

- {decision 1}: {user choice}
- {decision 2}: {user choice}

### Action Items

- [ ] {changes needed based on answers}
```

NEVER modify phase files — only document what needs updating.

## Output

After validation:

- Questions asked count
- Key decisions confirmed
- Items flagged for plan revision
- Recommendation: proceed to implementation OR revise plan first

## Next Steps

**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION — NO EXCEPTIONS** after completing, use `AskUserQuestion` to present:

- **"/feature-implement (Recommended)"** — Begin implementation with validated plan
- **"/refine"** — If plan needs PBI refinement first
- **"Skip, continue manually"** — User decides

---

> **[BLOCKING]** MUST ATTENTION use `AskUserQuestion` to interview user. Completing without asking ≥1 question = violation.

> **[IMPORTANT]** Use `TaskCreate` to break ALL work into small tasks BEFORE starting — including tasks for each file read. For simple tasks, AI MUST ATTENTION ask user whether to skip.

> **External Memory:** Complex/lengthy work → write findings + results to `tmp/reports/` — prevents context loss.

> **Evidence Gate:** MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION — every claim requires `file:line` proof or traced evidence with confidence % (>80% act, <80% verify first).

<!-- SYNC:project-reference-docs-guide -->

> **Project Reference Docs Gate (static JIT)** — Run after task-tracking bootstrap and immediately before target/source file reads, grep, edits, tests, or analysis. Project docs override generic framework assumptions; hooks may remind or accelerate this gate, but never prove that it ran.
>
> 1. Identify scope: file types, domain area, and operation.
> 2. **Read the configured project-config file first, if it exists.** Resolve its path through the project-config loader (default `docs/project-config.json`). **The project config is OPTIONAL: a project with no config is a supported, first-class state, not an error.** When it is absent, run on the framework's portable defaults and derive project facts (paths, run commands, conventions, architecture, test and spec layout) from repository evidence — manifests, lockfiles, scripts, CI definitions, directory layout, root instruction files — stating the assumption whenever one is material; do not block, and do not demand a bootstrap route before ordinary work. When it IS present, the minimum valid shape has a non-empty `project.name`; omitted optional capability properties use neutral defaults or skip that capability. A section its author DECLARED but left malformed or incomplete is a configuration error: fail closed on that section and run `/project-init` or `/project-config` before relying on it, because silently substituting defaults would present wrong project facts as authoritative. Use valid config for the adopter's paths, commands, architecture, specs, tests, and workflows, then verify material hints against repository evidence; never assume generic defaults are project facts.
> 3. **Always-on vs task-specific references:** Project initialization owns and ensures the project's `lessons.md` and docs-index inputs at their configured owner paths. Read them under the static project-context contract independently of task-specific `referenceDocs`; do not append them to that selection. For task-specific docs, when the configured `referenceDocs` property is an array, follow it exactly, including subsets and `[]`. When absent, use the runtime capability-aware resolver: its portable baseline plus only configuration- or repository-evidenced capabilities; a minimal project with no capability evidence may resolve to an empty task-specific set. The full scan-target manifest is a registry of metadata/aliases, not a default selection. Resolve configured paths using `docsRoots.projectReference.path` when present (default `docs/project-reference`; `docsRoots.projectReference.path` in `docs/project-config.json` overrides it). A custom reference doc declares `filename` and `purpose`, with optional `sections`, `templatePath`, and `scanTarget`. Built-in filenames keep their exact framework-owned target; other custom docs default to manual ownership, while `scanTarget: "generic"` opts one exact selected file into evidence-based scanning. Manual docs are not freshness-tracked or impact-routed. Never infer a target by basename; config and runtime path resolution reject lexical traversal and physical symlink escapes.
> 4. Read selected task-specific docs just in time before target work, then state: `Reference docs read: ... | Not applicable: ...`; an explicit empty selection means no task-specific docs are selected by the catalog. Still honor separately required references named by the active skill or task. An absent project config is not a missing doc: proceed on repository evidence and, at most, OFFER `/project-init` or `/project-config` as an optional one-time recording of those facts. If an always-on input or a selected/otherwise required doc is missing or stale, or a declared config section is malformed, use `/project-init` or the narrow owner route (`/project-config`, `/docs-init`, `/scan --target=<key>`, `/ai-context-refresh`) before relying on that input. If Codex mirrors are stale, use the explicit `/sync-codex` route or its documented `/ai-context-refresh` completion handoff for the active source-authoring task. After compaction, resume, delegation, or material context change, repeat selection and reading; prior conversation and hook output are not proof of current loading.
>
> **Ready when:** scope evaluated, the configured project-config file consulted or its absence recorded and the portable-defaults fallback applied, root always-on inputs are confirmed (completing project initialization if they are missing or stale), the declared task-specific `referenceDocs` selection is applied exactly or, when absent, the runtime capability-aware resolver output is applied (which may be empty), selected docs are read or an explicit empty selection is recorded, and the citation emitted.

<!-- SYNC:plan-quality -->

> **Plan Quality** — Every plan phase MUST ATTENTION include test specifications.
>
> 1. Keep a `## Test Specifications` section in every phase; resolve and validate `docs/project-config.json → specArtifacts` before choosing requirement, case, or evidence shape. A malformed or unsupported declaration blocks; it is never treated as absent.
> 2. With a valid native profile, use its configured `sections.intent/contracts/evidence`, canonical owner path, identifier grammar, and test-carrier dialect. Keep owner + case/scenario ID + optional variant identity and the actual executing test; preserve configured many-to-many cardinality.
> 3. Map every functional requirement or invariant to ≥1 native case/executor (or explicit `TBD` with rationale). Cite the assertion that proves the outcome at `file:line`; a case-ID match, grep, or aggregate result without inspecting the assertion path is not proof.
> 4. Only when `specArtifacts` is absent, use the strict default: `TC-{FEATURE}-{NNN}` in the phase Test Specifications section and the legacy business-spec `§3 AC / §4 BR / §5 invariants / §8 TC` shape. TDD-first references existing TCs with `Evidence: TBD`; implement-first keeps `TBD` until the configured spec/test workflow fills it.
> 5. Before any new workflow step: call `TaskList` and re-read the phase file.
> 6. On context compaction: call `TaskList` FIRST — never create duplicate tasks.
> 7. Verify every native case and its assertion, or every strict-default TC, before marking a phase complete; final evidence must be `file:line`, not TBD.
> 8. **Purpose-oriented naming:** For every planned public or cross-layer contract, port, interface, module, or adapter, name the consumer-visible capability or domain purpose; keep provider, framework, and transport names in concrete implementations (`IStorage`/`Storage` → `AzureBlobStorage`). — why: a contract name should survive an implementation swap.
> 9. **Contract-fit gate:** Check the proposed name against its callers and all implementations; use a narrower purpose name when a broad name overpromises (`IObjectStore` or `DocumentStore` instead of `IStorage` when the behavior is narrower). — why: abstraction names must describe the actual contract, not hide a mismatch.
> 10. **No speculative abstraction:** Plan an interface or port only when a real boundary, substitution need, or multiple meaningful implementations justifies it; keep a concrete type when it is the honest contract. — why: an unnecessary abstraction adds indirection and a second name without reducing change cost.
> 11. **Language convention:** Preserve the repository's naming syntax (`I` prefix where the language/project uses it); never force `I` or `Interface` markers across languages. — why: semantic purpose is portable, syntax is not.
> 12. **Foundation obligations — when the plan CREATES or CHANGES how the project is built, run, tested, or checked** (build or CI configuration, test harness, containerization, toolchain/dependency management, module boundaries, quality tooling): run `SYNC:engineering-foundation-gate` — its seven dimensions F1-F7, the four profile axes and the warranting matrix are in `.claude/docs/engineering-foundation-catalog.md`, which the plan reads directly when no carrier of that gate ran upstream — and carry every dimension it marks warranted into the plan as an **explicit phase with acceptance criteria** — never as an assumption that someone handles it later. Record each dimension deliberately skipped, with the reason. — why: a plan that stands up a foundation and silently omits a warranted dimension makes that omission permanent and invisible; foundations cost near nothing at creation and a great deal to retrofit.
>
> **Mode:** TDD-first → reference existing native cases (strict-default TCs only when `specArtifacts` is absent) with `Evidence: TBD`. Implement-first → use TBD until the project's configured spec/test workflow fills it; absent a profile, `/spec [mode=tests]` is the strict-default route. A declared invalid profile blocks instead of selecting this fallback.

> **Check downstream references before deleting or renaming.** Removing an artifact can stale docs, generated mirrors, configs, and callers; map references first.
> **Trace the full impact chain after edits.** Changing a definition can miss derived outputs and consumers. Follow the affected chain before declaring done.
> **Verify ALL affected outputs, not just the first.** One green check is not all green checks; validate every output surface the change can affect.
> **Assume existing values are intentional — ask WHY before changing OR flagging one as a defect.** Before changing or reporting a constant, limit, flag, cutoff, wording, or pattern, read nearby context and history, the CALLER's ordering, and 2+ sibling call sites of the same convention. A doc stating WHAT without WHY is missing rationale, not proof of a missing guard.
> **Surface ambiguity before acting — don't pick silently.** Multiple valid interpretations require an explicit question or stated assumption with risk.
> **Assert the outcome your system owns, not the intermediate state your infrastructure owns.** When verifying async work, assert the final business state — never the delivery/retry bookkeeping held in shared infrastructure that any co-running process can write. Such a check passes when run alone and flakes the moment anything else shares that infrastructure.
> **Store disposable generated output in the project workspace.** If an output can be regenerated and is not source code, a canonical source-of-truth, or an intentionally versioned projection, write it under the project-root `tmp/` or `temp/` directory (prefer `tmp/`), scoped to the run. This includes temporary state, integration/E2E results, reports, logs, screenshots, traces, videos, coverage, dumps, and candidate evidence. Never put these outputs in source, docs, the plans root (default `plans/`; a `docsRoots.plans.path` entry in `docs/project-config.json` overrides the path), the team-artifacts root (default `team-artifacts/`; `docsRoots.teamArtifacts.path` in the same config overrides the path), or mirror directories; the project-root `.gitignore` must ignore `/tmp/` and `/temp/` by default. Committed fixtures, accepted baselines, canonical specs/docs, and explicitly versioned generated mirrors remain at their declared owner paths.
> **Judge the environment before judging the code.** A bug report, failed test, error, or unexpected output is not proof of a code defect. Before and during adjudication, weigh environment causes as a competing hypothesis — setup, config, version and dependency state, service dependencies, stale artifacts or leftover state, and transient resource pressure (RAM, CPU, disk, handles, network). State the discriminator you ran; fix an environment cause in the environment, never by editing product code or weakening a test to absorb it.
> **Keep shared guidance role-relevant.** Universal guidance must help every receiving skill or agent; code-specific obligations belong only in code-specific protocols.

- **MANDATORY** Before project-specific work, load the OPTIONAL project-config (default `docs/project-config.json`) via its loader.

When present: require non-empty `project.name`, use neutral defaults/skips for omitted optional capabilities, and fail closed on a declared malformed section.

- **MANDATORY** Load detail JUST IN TIME, immediately before the first target read/grep/edit/test — a hook event or a prior turn is NEVER evidence that the current files were read. Re-resolve selection and re-read after compaction, resume, delegation, or a context change.
- **MANDATORY** The project-init-owned `lessons.md` and docs-index inputs are always-on at their configured owner paths, read independently of task-specific `referenceDocs`. A missing/stale root instruction file or required reference doc, or a malformed declared config section → auto-run `/project-init` (or the narrow lower-level route) before relying on that input.

<!-- SYNC:project-protocol-overlay -->

> **Project Protocol Overlay** — Before executing this skill, resolve project overlays from the index at `<docsRoots.projectReference.path>/skill-protocols-reference.md` (default `docs/project-reference/`; `docsRoots.projectReference.path` in `docs/project-config.json` overrides it). A matching `referenceDocs[]` filename may relocate the index within that root; this registry is independent from task-specific reference-doc selection, so omitted or empty `referenceDocs` does not disable it. The index's `**Protocols directory:**` header selects a project-root-relative body directory (default `docs/project-protocols/`). Match this skill against the `Target` column and take the most specific tier ONLY — exact name > glob > `*`. **That precedence orders overlays against EACH OTHER, never against this skill.** Read only matched bodies derived as `<protocols-dir>/<Name>.md`; the row's Body link is display text, never a read path. Reject unsafe paths without reading. A matched body that is missing or malformed is REPORTED and skipped — never reconstructed from the index Description. An absent index or no match -> proceed with no overlay, silently. Full contract: `.claude/skills/project-skill-protocol/references/registry.md`.
>
> Overlays are **ADDITIVE ONLY**: they ADD rules on top of this skill's own protocol and NEVER replace, override, disable, or reinterpret a rule it already states — removing every overlay must return this skill to exactly its documented behavior. An overlay is a BRIEF, not an authority escalation: it can NEVER waive a workflow gate, git discipline, a review gate, or a user-confirmation gate. A genuine overlay-vs-skill conflict, or two equally-specific overlays that directly contradict -> surface both to the user; NEVER resolve silently.

**MUST ATTENTION** resolve this skill's overlays from the index at `<docsRoots.projectReference.path>/skill-protocols-reference.md` (default `docs/project-reference/`; overridable in `docs/project-config.json`); an empty task `referenceDocs` does NOT disable this lookup. Read ONLY matched bodies from the directory the index header names (default `docs/project-protocols/`). Specificity (exact > glob > `*`) ranks overlays against EACH OTHER, never against the skill. Missing/malformed body → report and skip; no index or no match → proceed silently. Overlays are ADDITIVE ONLY — never an authority escalation or a gate waiver; equal-tier contradiction goes to the user.

## Closing Reminders

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION Goal:** Force every assumption-laden plan decision and every preservation-critical behavior through explicit user confirmation BEFORE implementation — by interviewing the user with critical questions that validate assumptions and surface issues — so no unstated assumption silently reaches code.

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION Main steps:** detect plan type → resolve the plan and applicability gate → read plan/phase files → extract decision topics → ask bounded user questions → document confirmed answers → offer implement/refine/skip.

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION Applicability:** validate the embedded decomposition/slice evidence, explicit roadmap milestone chain, framework technical evidence, or EXEMPT reason/owner plus non-goals, definitions, scenario proof where applicable, skeleton/commands, redacted evidence, and human approval before offering implementation; unresolved intent or evidence is BLOCKED.

**Protocols in force (concise digest of the SYNC/shared blocks this skill carries):**

- **Nested Task Creation:** child skill still creates visible phase tasks; link parent when nested.
- **Task Tracking & External Report:** bootstrap task breakdown first; persist findings incrementally to `tmp/reports/`.
- **Critical Thinking:** MUST ATTENTION apply critical + sequential thinking; cite proof; confidence >80% to act.
- **Sequential Thinking:** structured multi-step Thought N/M with REVISION/BRANCH/HYPOTHESIS markers and confidence closer.
- **Project Reference Docs:** read required project-reference docs before target work; always include `lessons.md`.
- **Understand Code First:** MUST ATTENTION read code and grep 3+ patterns before any modification.
- **Plan Quality:** include `## Test Specifications` with TC-{FEATURE}-{NNN} IDs per phase.
- **Cross-Service Check:** scan producers, consumers, sagas, contracts; flag breaking-change risk.
- **AI Mistake Prevention:** verify generated content against evidence, trace downstream references, verify all affected outputs, re-read after context loss, surface ambiguity.

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** run the main steps IN ORDER — Phase 0 Detect Plan Type → resolve plan path → load `mode` + `questions` range → Phase 0.5 Product Readiness / Plan Gate → Step 1 Read `plan.md` + all `phase-*.md` (flag decisions/assumptions/risks/tradeoffs) → Step 2 Extract topics (9 categories) → Step 3 Generate questions (2-4 options each) → Step 4 Interview via `AskUserQuestion` (≤4 per call) → Step 5 Document answers → offer implement/refine/skip — why: the pipeline IS the work; never collapse or skip a step from memory

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** validate decisions with the user via `AskUserQuestion` — NEVER auto-decide or self-answer; completing without ≥1 question is a protocol violation — why: the user owns every assumption-laden choice, not the agent
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** detect plan type FIRST (Phase 0) BEFORE generating questions — bugfix keywords (fix, bug, regression, broken, defect) make the Preservation question BLOCKING, never skipped — why: detection drives which categories fire and the Preservation gate
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** NEVER modify phase files — persist results by adding ONLY a `## Validation Summary` (confirmed decisions + action items) to `plan.md` — why: phase files are the plan's source of truth and validation is a read-then-annotate pass

- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** break work into small todo tasks using `TaskCreate` BEFORE starting (including a task per file read); call `TaskList` first on context loss, never duplicate — why: resume existing tasks rather than re-plan after compaction
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** honor the `questions` MIN-MAX range and `mode` from `## Plan Context` as hard constraints; give 2-4 concrete options per question, never go below min — why: the interview budget is configured, not improvised
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** treat the Preservation "Unsure" answer as BLOCKED → return BLOCKED status and route to `/plan` preservation analysis before any implementation — why: an unverified preserved-correctness invariant is a silent regression risk
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** if the plan introduces new tech/packages, probe whether alternatives were evaluated before accepting the choice — why: unevaluated dependency choices raise future change cost
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** cite `file:line` proof or traced evidence with confidence % for every claim (>80% act, <80% verify first); admit uncertainty rather than present a guess as fact — why: speculation drives wrong validation questions
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** search 3+ existing patterns and read the plan + phase files BEFORE generating questions — match the codebase's local conventions over generic framework defaults — why: questions grounded in actual code surface real decisions, not invented ones
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** apply the Easy-to-Change lens before any rule below — flag decisions that raise future change cost (coupling, hidden state, duplicated knowledge, unclear intent, irreversible early choices)
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** add a final review task to verify work quality

**Anti-Rationalization:**

| Evasion                            | Rebuttal                                                            |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "Plan is simple, skip validation"  | Simple plans still have implicit decisions. Apply anyway.           |
| "Already know the answers"         | Show user responses as proof. No responses = no validation.         |
| "Preservation doesn't apply here"  | If title has fix/bug/regression/broken/defect → ALWAYS applies.     |
| "Phase 0 not needed"               | Detection drives the Preservation gate. NEVER skip.                 |
| "Only ask a few questions"         | Use the `questions` range from Plan Context. Never go below min.    |
| "I'll just answer for the user"    | `AskUserQuestion` is mandatory. Self-answer = no validation.        |
| "New library is obviously fine"    | Probe whether alternatives were evaluated before accepting it.      |
| "I'll edit the phase files inline" | NEVER. Add only a `## Validation Summary` to `plan.md`.             |

**[TASK-PLANNING]** Before acting, analyze task scope and systematically break it into small todo tasks and sub-tasks using TaskCreate.

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** detect plan type (Phase 0) FIRST — bugfix keywords make Preservation BLOCKING.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** validate with the user via `AskUserQuestion` — NEVER auto-decide.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** NEVER modify phase files — add only a `## Validation Summary` to `plan.md`.
