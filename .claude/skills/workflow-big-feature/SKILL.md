## Quick Summary

**Goal:** [Workflow] Trigger Big Feature workflow — research-driven development for large, complex, or ambiguous features needing market research, business evaluation, domain analysis, tech stack research, and architecture design before implementation.

**Summary:**

- Apply the shared four-operand `isLargeIdea` rule before research and planning; large ideas carry the complete decomposition block in PBIs/specs and downstream presentation/mock-up artifacts. Run `/scenario` before the first plan when the slice/risk context requires it; do not create a roadmap artifact by default.
- Keep research, architecture, specs, PBIs, and implementation downstream of the product boundary; preserve explicit non-goals and human decisions.
- Every generated PBI in this workflow MUST pass the Releasable Outcome Gate: one independently releasable actor-facing outcome with a complete entry-to-result journey; technical/foundation/setup work is attached enabling work, never a standalone PBI. UI PBIs require the full page/view, navigation, component, state, and mock-app flow surface.
- Execute the canonical steps in order, with reviewed scaffolding before feature work and evidence-backed verification at the end.

 - **Main steps:** classify/decompose → research/evaluate → domain/architecture/scenario → plan/review → PBI/story/mock-up/spec gates → scaffold/review → implementation/integration verification → final review/security/test/docs/handoff.

**Workflow:**

1. **Detect** — classify request scope and target artifacts.
2. **Execute** — apply required steps with evidence-backed actions.
3. **Verify** — confirm constraints, output quality, and completion evidence.

**Key Rules:**

- MUST ATTENTION keep claims evidence-based (`file:line`) with confidence >80% to act.
- MUST ATTENTION keep task tracking updated as each step starts/completes.
- MUST ATTENTION define success criteria before execution and loop until observable verification passes.
- MUST ATTENTION when creating/reviewing specs or tests, name `Business Intent / Invariant Guarded` or the protected business intent/invariant and ensure the test would fail if that intent breaks.
- MUST ATTENTION classify the idea with `isLargeIdea = multipleIndependentOutcomes || ambiguousOrResearchHeavy || releaseScopeDecomposition || oversizedPbiThatMustSplit` before research, specs, PBIs, or plans. When true, require `outcome_slices`, `dependencies_order`, `non_goals`, `risks_evidence`, and `deferred_work_owner`; run `/scenario` conditionally for the embedded scope. An existing roadmap is read-only context and only an explicit roadmap request enters the standalone writer.
- NEVER skip mandatory workflow or skill gates.

## Repeated Steps Disambiguation (CRITICAL for task creation)

This workflow has steps that appear multiple times. When creating tasks, use these descriptions to distinguish them:

| Step           | Occurrence   | Task Description                                                                  |
| -------------- | ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/plan`        | 1st (pos 14) | PLAN₁: High-level architecture plan (after architecture-design and scenario gate) |
| `/plan`        | 2nd (pos 30) | PLAN₂: Sprint-ready implementation plan (after artifact-review --type=spec-tests) |
| `/plan-review` | 1st (pos 15) | Review PLAN₁ architecture                                                         |
| `/plan-review` | 2nd (pos 31) | Review PLAN₂ implementation                                                       |

**NEVER deduplicate** — each occurrence is a distinct task with a different purpose.

---

## Closing Rule

Every non-skipped step = `TaskUpdate in_progress` → `Skill` tool → complete skill → `TaskUpdate completed`. A cited conditional skip explicitly authorized by canonical `preActions.injectContext` may complete without a skill call.

**IMPORTANT MANDATORY Steps:** /idea -> /web-research -> /deep-research -> /business-evaluation -> /spec-discovery -> /domain-analysis -> /why-review -> /tech-stack-research -> /architecture-design -> /architecture-scalability-review -> /why-review -> /scenario -> /plan -> /plan-review -> /refine -> /why-review -> /artifact-review --type=pbi -> /story -> /why-review -> /artifact-review --type=story -> /pbi-challenge -> /dor-gate -> /pbi-mockup -> /spec -> /spec [mode=tests] -> /why-review -> /artifact-review --type=spec-tests -> /spec-clarify -> /plan -> /plan-review -> /scaffold -> /architecture-review-full -> /plan-validate -> /why-review -> /plan-execute -> /seed-test-data -> /domain-entities-review -> /integration-test -> /integration-test-review -> /integration-test-verify -> /spec [mode=sync] -> /workflow-review-changes -> /security-review -> /changelog -> /test -> /scan --target=domain-entities -> /docs-update -> /workflow-end -> /watzup

> **[BLOCKING]** Each non-skipped step MUST ATTENTION invoke its `Skill` tool — marking a task `completed` without skill invocation is a workflow violation, except a cited conditional skip explicitly authorized by canonical `preActions.injectContext`. NEVER batch-complete validation gates.

Activate the `workflow-big-feature` workflow. Run `/start-workflow workflow-big-feature` with the user's prompt as context.

> **Spec check (before investigation):** If `docs/specs/` has a spec for the affected service/module, read the relevant ERD + business-rules + API-contracts files FIRST. Engineering specs provide domain context that reduces investigation time significantly. Command: `ls docs/specs/` to discover available app buckets or flat system folders; then probe `ls docs/specs/{app-bucket}/` or `ls docs/specs/{system-name}/` to find the specific service spec.

**Steps:** /idea → /web-research → /deep-research → /business-evaluation → /spec-discovery → /domain-analysis → /why-review → /tech-stack-research → /architecture-design → /architecture-scalability-review → /why-review → /scenario → /plan → /plan-review → /refine → /why-review → /artifact-review --type=pbi → /story → /why-review → /artifact-review --type=story → /pbi-challenge → /dor-gate → /pbi-mockup → /spec → /spec [mode=tests] → /why-review → /artifact-review --type=spec-tests → /spec-clarify → /plan → /plan-review → /scaffold → /architecture-review-full → /plan-validate → /why-review → /plan-execute → /seed-test-data → /domain-entities-review → /integration-test → /integration-test-review → /integration-test-verify → /spec [mode=sync] → /workflow-review-changes → /security-review → /changelog → /test → /scan --target=domain-entities → /docs-update → /workflow-end → /watzup

> **[CONDITIONAL TERMINAL DOMAIN-ENTITY REFERENCE REFRESH]** After `/test` and before `/docs-update`, run `/scan --target=domain-entities` to refresh the project-reference entity catalog only when the final diff changes an entity/model, DTO/data contract, persistence schema/migration, or entity-sync evidence represented in `docs/project-reference/domain-entities-reference.md`. Otherwise mark the scan step completed with a cited skip reason naming the changed files and why they are outside this scope; this is the explicitly authorized exception to the per-step skill-invocation rule.

<!-- SYNC:ai-mistake-prevention -->

> **AI Mistake Prevention** — Failure modes to avoid on every task:
>
> **Re-read files after context changes.** Context compaction, resume, or long-running work can make memory stale; verify current files before acting.
> **Verify generated content against source evidence.** AI hallucinates APIs, names, claims, and document facts. Check the relevant source before documenting or referencing.
> **Check downstream references before deleting or renaming.** Removing an artifact can stale docs, generated mirrors, configs, and callers; map references first.
> **Trace the full impact chain after edits.** Changing a definition can miss derived outputs and consumers. Follow the affected chain before declaring done.
> **Verify ALL affected outputs, not just the first.** One green check is not all green checks; validate every output surface the change can affect.
> **Assume existing values are intentional — ask WHY before changing OR flagging one as a defect.** Before changing or reporting a constant, limit, flag, cutoff, wording, or pattern, read nearby context and history, the CALLER's ordering, and 2+ sibling call sites of the same convention. A doc stating WHAT without WHY is missing rationale, not proof of a missing guard.
> **Surface ambiguity before acting — don't pick silently.** Multiple valid interpretations require an explicit question or stated assumption with risk.
> **Assert the outcome your system owns, not the intermediate state your infrastructure owns.** When verifying async work, assert the final business state — never the delivery/retry bookkeeping held in shared infrastructure that any co-running process can write. Such a check passes when run alone and flakes the moment anything else shares that infrastructure.
> **Keep shared guidance role-relevant.** Universal guidance must help every receiving skill or agent; code-specific obligations belong only in code-specific protocols.

<!-- SYNC:nested-task-creation -->

> **Nested Task Expansion Contract** — For workflow-step invocation, the `[Workflow] ...` row is only a parent container; the child skill still creates visible phase tasks.
>
> 1. Call `TaskList` first. If a matching active parent workflow row exists, set `nested=true` and record `parentTaskId`; otherwise run standalone.
> 2. Create one task per declared phase before phase work. When nested, prefix subjects `[N.M] /skill-name — phase`.
> 3. When nested, link the parent with `TaskUpdate(parentTaskId, addBlockedBy: [childIds])`.
> 4. Orchestrators must pre-expand a child skill's phase list and link the workflow row before invoking that child skill or sub-agent.
> 5. Mark exactly one child `in_progress` before work and `completed` immediately after evidence is written.
> 6. Complete the parent only after all child tasks are completed or explicitly cancelled with reason.
>
> **Blocked until:** `TaskList` done, child phases created, parent linked when nested, first child marked `in_progress`.

> **Sub-Agent Return Contract** — When this skill spawns a sub-agent, the sub-agent MUST return ONLY this structure. Main agent reads only this summary — NEVER requests full sub-agent output inline.

>
> Main agent reads `Full report` file ONLY when: (a) resolving a specific blocker, or (b) building a fix plan.
> Sub-agent writes full report incrementally (per SYNC:incremental-persistence) — not held in memory.
>
> **Context budget** — the return payload is a SUMMARY, not a transcript: ≤10 finding bullets, no raw file contents / full diffs / verbatim logs inline, no re-pasted source. Everything beyond the summary lives in the `Full report` on disk. A sub-agent that would exceed the summary shape MUST write the detail to its report and return only the pointer — the orchestrator's context is the scarce resource the whole map-reduce protects.

<!-- SYNC:critical-thinking-mindset:reminder -->

**MUST ATTENTION** apply critical + sequential thinking — every claim needs appropriate traced evidence (`file:line` for repo/code claims; source URL or artifact section for research, product, content, and docs claims); confidence >80% to act, <60% DO NOT recommend. Anti-hallucination: never present guess as fact, admit uncertainty freely, cross-reference independently, stay skeptical of own confidence.

<!-- /SYNC:critical-thinking-mindset:reminder -->

<!-- SYNC:ai-mistake-prevention:reminder -->

**MUST ATTENTION** apply AI mistake prevention — verify generated content against evidence, trace downstream references before deleting or renaming, verify all affected outputs, re-read files after context loss, and surface ambiguity before acting.

<!-- /SYNC:ai-mistake-prevention:reminder -->

<!-- SYNC:nested-task-creation:reminder -->

- **MANDATORY** Parent workflow rows do not replace child phase tracking; expand phases and link the parent when nested.
- **MANDATORY** Orchestrators pre-expand child skill phases before invocation; use `[N.M] /skill-name — phase` prefixes and one-`in_progress` discipline.

<!-- /SYNC:nested-task-creation:reminder -->

<!-- SYNC:project-protocol-overlay -->

> **Project Protocol Overlay** — Before executing this skill, resolve any PROJECT overlay rules layered onto it: match this skill's name against the `Target` column of the project's skill-protocol index (`docs/project-reference/skill-protocols-reference.md` by default; a `referenceDocs` entry in `docs/project-config.json` overrides the path), taking the most specific matching tier ONLY — exact name > glob > `*`. **That precedence orders overlays against EACH OTHER, never against this skill.** Read ONLY the matched bodies, resolved as `<protocols-dir>/<Name>.md`; a row's Body link is display text, never a read path. A matched body that is missing or malformed is REPORTED and skipped — never reconstructed from the index Description. No index, or no match -> proceed with no overlay, silently. Full contract: `.claude/skills/project-skill-protocol/references/registry.md`.
>
> Overlays are **ADDITIVE ONLY**: they ADD rules on top of this skill's own protocol and NEVER replace, override, disable, or reinterpret a rule it already states — removing every overlay must return this skill to exactly its documented behavior. An overlay is a BRIEF, not an authority escalation: it can NEVER waive a workflow gate, git discipline, a review gate, or a user-confirmation gate. A genuine overlay-vs-skill conflict, or two equally-specific overlays that directly contradict -> surface both to the user; NEVER resolve silently.

<!-- /SYNC:project-protocol-overlay -->

<!-- SYNC:project-protocol-overlay:reminder -->

**MUST ATTENTION** resolve project protocol overlays for this skill BEFORE executing — most specific matching tier only (exact > glob > `*`, which ranks overlays against each other, NEVER against this skill), read only matched bodies at `<protocols-dir>/<Name>.md`; a missing or malformed body is reported, never reconstructed. Overlays are ADDITIVE ONLY (they never replace this skill's own rules) and are a brief, NEVER an authority escalation; an equal-specificity contradiction goes to the user.

## Closing Reminders

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION Goal:** Complete the reviewed large-feature workflow with a bounded, independently releasable actor-facing outcome, embedded decomposition when triggered, scenario evidence, reviewed foundation, full-flow UI proof when applicable, implementation proof, and synchronized handoff; ordinary runs never create `docs/product-roadmap.md`.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION Main steps:** classify/decompose → research → domain/architecture/scenario → plan/review → PBI/story/mock-up/spec gates → scaffold/review → implementation/integration verification → final review/security/test/docs/handoff.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** every generated PBI MUST pass `.claude/skills/shared/releasable-pbi-contract.md`; technical/foundation/setup work is enabling work under a releasable PBI, and UI PBIs require all pages/views, navigation, components, states, and a connected mock-app demo.

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION Protocols in force (concise digest of the SYNC/shared blocks this skill carries):**

- **AI Mistake Prevention:** verify generated content against evidence, trace downstream references, verify all affected outputs, re-read after context loss, surface ambiguity.
- **Nested Task Creation:** Expand child phases, link parent when nested, one `in_progress`.
- **Critical Thinking:** Traced `file:line` proof per claim, confidence >80% to act.
- **Incremental Persistence:** Append findings to `plans/reports/` per file, never hold in memory.
- **Subagent Return Contract:** Return summary only (≤10 bullets), full detail to disk report.

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** break work into small todo tasks using `TaskCreate` BEFORE starting
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** search codebase for 3+ similar patterns before creating new code
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** cite `file:line` evidence for every claim (confidence >80% to act)
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** add a final review todo task to verify work quality

**[TASK-PLANNING]** Before acting, analyze task scope and systematically break it into small todo tasks and sub-tasks using TaskCreate.

> **[IMPORTANT]** Analyze how big the task is and break it into many small todo tasks systematically before starting — this is very important.
