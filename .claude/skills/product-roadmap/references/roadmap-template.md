# Product Roadmap Template

Use this structure for the roadmap document — default `docs/product-roadmap.md`, overridden by a `docsRoots.productRoadmap.path` entry in `docs/project-config.json`. Keep milestones outcome-based and keep implementation details out. Replace `{plans-root}` below with the resolved plans root before writing: a `docsRoots.plans.path` entry in `docs/project-config.json` wins, `.ck.json` `paths.plans` is the fallback when project-config declares nothing, and `plans` is the last-resort default.
