## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Generate a copy-ready architecture foundation that follows the project's chosen paradigm—applicable abstractions, infrastructure, examples, and quality gates—before feature implementation.

**Summary:**
- **Purpose + scope:** Build reusable architecture infrastructure and golden-path examples, not feature code; adapt checklist templates to the detected stack and plan, skip irrelevant items with evidence.
- **Ordered main flow:** (1) Activation Guards → (2) Read Plan → (3) Generate the applicable Backend and/or Frontend/UI checklist → (4) Validate against Plan → (5) confirm via `ask user question tool` → (6) scaffold approved abstractions + applicable foundations + examples → (7) verify build, architecture, testability, and Verification Gate → (8) `/linter-setup` → `/harness-setup` → `ask user question tool` handoff.
- **Testability gate:** Resolve Unit/Integration/System/E2E and warranted Performance/Scale applicability or evidence-backed `N/A`; record owner/root/data, copy-ready full/focused commands, zero-match failure, CI/simple Windows/macOS/Linux entry, host/container modes, environment reach, identity, idempotent/additive isolation, and repeat proof. Unresolved applicable fields block; do not invent E2E coverage.
- **Non-negotiables:** Suitable existing foundations covering the planned boundary or wrong workflow → SKIP and mark completed; every plan decision maps to a checklist item; applicable project foundations must pass; sensor setup only via `/linter-setup` then `/harness-setup`; block `/feature-implement` until verification passes; cite evidence and confidence.

**Workflow:** Follow the ordered main flow above; the detailed Workflow below owns execution.

**Key Rules:**

- **MUST ATTENTION** use evidence to resolve applicability, scope, and completion; **NEVER** guess missing runners, commands, or patterns.
- **MUST ATTENTION** treat checklists as adaptable templates and confirm the final checklist before generating code.
- **MUST ATTENTION** apply the project's selected architecture and applicable design principles, verify required foundations, and keep `/feature-implement` blocked until the Verification Gate passes.

## Activation Guards (MANDATORY — Check Before Executing)

**ALL conditions must be true to proceed:**

1. **Workflow check:** Active workflow is `workflow-greenfield-init` OR `workflow-big-feature`. If not → SKIP this skill entirely, mark step as completed.
2. **Existing scaffolding check:** AI MUST ATTENTION self-investigate for existing base/foundational abstractions:
    - Abstract/base classes: grep `abstract class.*Base|Base[A-Z]\w+|Abstract[A-Z]\w+`
    - Generic interfaces: grep `interface I\w+<|IGeneric|IBase`
    - Infrastructure abstractions: grep `IRepository|IUnitOfWork|IService|IHandler`
    - Utility/extension layers: grep `Extensions|Helpers|Utils|Common` (directories or classes)
    - Frontend foundations: grep `base.*component|base.*service|base.*store|abstract.*component` (case-insensitive)
    - DI/IoC registration: grep `AddScoped|AddSingleton|providers:|NgModule|@Injectable`
3. **Assess suitability in the planned boundary.** Map each required foundation to an existing owner (`file:line`), its supported consumer/boundary and reuse fit. Repository-wide presence is discovery evidence, never a skip predicate. Record `reused`, `missing`, or `unsuitable` per requirement.
4. **SKIP only when every applicable requirement is covered by a suitable reusable foundation.** Cite the coverage map and mark complete. Otherwise PROCEED only for missing/unsuitable foundations in the planned service/module; reuse fitting owners and avoid replacing unrelated foundations.

## When to Use

- After the second `/plan` + `/plan --mode=review` in greenfield-init or big-feature workflows, before `/feature-implement`.
- When a new service/module needs its own base architecture and no foundation exists.
- **NOT** when suitable existing foundations cover every requirement of the planned boundary

## Workflow

1. **Read Plan** — Parse architecture decisions, tech stack, and domain model.
2. **Generate Scaffolding Checklist** — Cover applicable abstractions and infrastructure identified by the plan, using the Backend and/or Frontend/UI categories below.
3. **Validate Against Plan** — Map every architecture decision to a scaffolding item.
4. **Present to User** — Use `ask user question tool` to confirm the checklist before code generation.
5. **Scaffold** — Create only the abstractions, infrastructure, and examples selected by the plan and supported by project conventions.
6. **Verify** — Build; validate the selected architecture, testability, and the Verification Gate; then invoke `/linter-setup` → `/harness-setup` and present the `ask user question tool` handoff.

**AI surface?** Only if the plan scaffolds or changes a model call, prompt, agent, tool/MCP, retrieval or eval (see `node .claude/scripts/ai-signal-scan.cjs`): read `.claude/skills/shared/protocols/ai-feature-framing-gate.md` and apply it; otherwise skip this line.

## Backend Scaffolding Categories

AI must self-investigate chosen tech stack, produce a checklist covering these categories. Names below are illustrative — adapt to the project's language, framework conventions, and actual needs.

### Domain Layer

- [ ] Base entity interface + abstract class (Id, timestamps, audit fields)
- [ ] Value object base (equality by value)
- [ ] Domain event interface

### Application Layer

- [ ] Command/query handler abstractions (CQRS if applicable)
- [ ] Validation result pattern
- [ ] Base DTO with mapping protocol
- [ ] Pagination wrapper
- [ ] Operation result pattern (success/failure)

### Infrastructure Layer

- [ ] Generic repository interface + one concrete implementation
- [ ] Unit of work interface (if applicable)
- [ ] Messaging/event bus abstraction
- [ ] External service abstractions (cache, storage, email — only if plan requires them)
- [ ] Database context / connection setup
- [ ] DI/IoC registration module

### Cross-Cutting

- [ ] Current user context abstraction
- [ ] Testable date/time provider
- [ ] Exception hierarchy (domain, validation, not-found)
- [ ] Error handling middleware
- [ ] Strongly-typed configuration models

## Frontend Scaffolding Categories

### Core Architecture Candidates

- [ ] Base component or shared lifecycle abstraction — only when the configured architecture or demonstrated shared behavior calls for one
- [ ] Form abstraction with validation/dirty tracking — only when the project pattern and reuse justify it
- [ ] List abstraction with pagination/sorting/filtering — only when the platform and product need a shared owner

### State & API Candidates

- [ ] Shared state abstraction with relevant loading/error/data behavior — only when configured or required by the plan
- [ ] API/request wrapper with interceptors and error handling — only when the project architecture calls for one
- [ ] Auth/request configuration — follow the project's existing security and environment model; do not add a generic interceptor by default

### Shared Utilities Candidates

- [ ] Shared model/serialization helpers — only when supported by the chosen architecture
- [ ] Common utility functions — only for behavior with a demonstrated shared owner

### UI Foundation

> **Apply only when:** the plan includes a user-facing UI. Select items for the configured web, mobile, desktop, or other UI platform; skip the entire section for projects or changes without a UI.

#### Design Tokens (only when the plan establishes a shared system)

- [ ] Create a token source in the project's chosen format only when a shared design system is in scope
- [ ] Define only the color, spacing, typography, layout, motion, or layering values the target needs; do not impose a minimum token catalog
- [ ] Add theme support only when the product requires it and its platform has a relevant theming mechanism

#### Layout and Size Adaptation (where supported)

- [ ] App shell or window/navigation structure when required by the plan and platform
- [ ] Layout/container primitives that solve an evidenced reuse or responsive need
- [ ] Platform-supported size adaptation (for example CSS breakpoints, native size classes, or resizable-window layouts) when required by the target

#### Shared UI Components (only when the plan requires them)

- [ ] Shared loading, error, or empty-state component when multiple surfaces need a common owner
- [ ] Notification/feedback component when required by the product interaction model
- [ ] Shared button/input abstractions only when existing components, planned reuse, and platform APIs support them

#### UI Convention Documentation (when established by the plan)

- [ ] Create a `design-system/README.md` only when the project establishes a shared design system; document its real tokens, components, tiers, or platform concepts rather than preselecting them
- [ ] Author `ui-review-principles.md` only when the project adopts explicit UI review rules. Base it on the configured platform, styling, accessibility, responsive, layering, and async-state conventions. BEM and CSS nesting limits are examples only when the project selects CSS/BEM rules.
- **No-UI skip rule:** create no UI convention or design-system documents when the project has no UI surface.
- [ ] **Discovery gate:** each UI convention doc created here leads with its purpose, when to read it and its critical rules, and is routed from the docs index or root context — select it in `referenceDocs` through `/project-config` so the generated Doc Lookup routes it; a doc nothing routes to is never read.

## Example / Golden-Path Reference Scaffolding (when it improves adoption)

> When the selected foundation introduces reusable patterns, consider a small, compile-checked golden-path example for each applicable pattern. Examples make chosen contracts reviewable and easy to copy; do not create them for unselected patterns, absent layers, or project types where examples add no value. The architecture report/configuration determines the expected set.

### Location & lifecycle (isolated, production-excluded)

- Examples live in a DEDICATED, ISOLATED `examples/` tree (project-root `examples/`, or `examples/` inside the project-reference docs root — default `docs/project-reference/`; path from `docsRoots.projectReference.path` in `docs/project-config.json`) — **NEVER mixed into the production `src/` tree.**
- Name every file `*.example.*` (e.g. `create-order.command.example.ts`, `Order.entity.example.cs`).
- **CI-compiled/linted but EXCLUDED from the production build** via a project-appropriate mechanism (separate compile target / tsconfig references / test-only project / build-exclude glob).
- Devs COPY an example into `src/` to start a real feature; the whole `examples/` tree is deleted wholesale once no longer needed.

### One worked example per selected, applicable pattern (no fixed count)

- **Backend:** include only patterns selected by the architecture (for example, a use-case entry point, domain invariant, repository boundary, or event consumer).
- **Frontend (only for patterns established by the plan):** one representative UI example using the selected component/state/request architecture; do not generate a store, API service, or base component unless the project has chosen one.
- **Tests:** include examples only for test layers the project actually has; follow its configured test style and cover important success/failure outcomes when relevant.
- **Absent/unselected pattern skips:** omit patterns that are not selected, not useful at the project's scale, or belong to an absent layer; record the reason in the scaffold report without inventing architecture.

### Every example MUST

1. Follow the project's detected patterns — read `*-patterns-reference.md` in the project-reference docs root (default `docs/project-reference/`; path from `docsRoots.projectReference.path` in `docs/project-config.json`) and mirror the exact shapes.
2. Use an abstraction when the plan establishes it; otherwise demonstrate the target platform's idiomatic approach without inventing a base class, store, or wrapper.
3. Compile/lint clean under the CI (non-production) target.
4. Carry this header comment verbatim (adapt the comment syntax to the language): `GOLDEN-PATH EXAMPLE — copy into src/ for real features; the examples/ tree is deleted when unused; NOT compiled into the production build.`
5. Contain **NO secrets, real credentials, or real endpoints** — use obvious placeholders ONLY (`EXAMPLE_API_KEY`, `example.invalid`, `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000`).
6. **Frontend examples only — follow the chosen visual authority.** Use configured tokens and components when present. If no shared system exists, use values appropriate to the platform and brief; introduce project-wide tokens only when the plan approves a design system. Demonstrate the states required by the feature and platform on applicable examples, and use real interface copy where the example is user-facing.

### Right-sizing

Examples DEMONSTRATE patterns — NOT a feature. Honor the scale-tier guard: a tiny T0/B0 project gets the minimal applicable set, never speculative extras.

### Testability Contract Resolution (MANDATORY before handoff)

Read the completed `architecture --mode=design` Testability & Execution Contract matrix before generating examples. Resolve every tier in the scaffold report and carry the same decisions into `/harness-setup`:

| Tier | Required scaffold output |
| --- | --- |
| Unit | Create or document one applicable pure/domain example, its runner/root, full and focused commands, zero-match failure behavior, CI gate, and simple Windows/macOS/Linux entry point. |
| Integration/System | Create or document one applicable public-path example, its runner/root, full and focused commands, zero-match failure behavior, CI gate, and simple Windows/macOS/Linux entry point. |
| E2E | Create or document one applicable configured-browser journey and commands; if no framework/configuration/command is evidenced, record `N/A — {evidence}` and create no invented browser example. |

For each applicable persistent tier, the handoff also records the run/test identity and unique business-data suffix, supported public setup path, realistic valid data, count-before-create idempotent/restart-safe reference setup, additive/no-reset accumulation, mutable-root and parallel-worker isolation, realistic pacing/arrange barrier, exact result, and two consecutive no-reset full runs. If scaffold has not executed the commands yet, record `planned — {owner}` rather than claiming a pass. Include these contract rows in the existing user-confirmed final checklist; unresolved material tool choices still use the existing `ask user question tool` gate.

## Code Quality Gate Selection (MANDATORY MUST ATTENTION — Before Feature Code)

Select automated checks that fit the project's languages, runtime, risk, and delivery process. Reuse existing checks; add only controls that catch a relevant defect class and can be maintained. Record why a check is not applicable instead of adding a tool solely to complete this list.

### Static Analysis & Linting

- [ ] Configure a language-appropriate linter/analyzer when the ecosystem and codebase support a useful, maintainable ruleset.
- [ ] Set warning/strictness thresholds for new code according to tool quality and project conventions; do not adopt a rule that produces noisy or unreviewable output.
- [ ] Use compiler/type/static checks where available and relevant; treat line coverage as a diagnostic, not proof of behavior quality.
- [ ] Use a formatter/shared style config when the language and team benefit from consistent automated formatting.

### Build-Time Quality Enforcement

- [ ] Choose the fastest useful local/commit checks and enforce the authoritative set in CI when CI exists; avoid running the same expensive check redundantly at every lifecycle stage.
- [ ] Make relevant build, test, lint, type, and security checks fail clearly when they find a project-relevant defect.
- [ ] Assess test strength through meaningful outcome assertions; use mutation/fault-injection tools where they fit, otherwise use an evidence-backed assertion review or focused defect-seeding exercise. Do not require a mutation score tool where none is workable.
- [ ] Scan dependencies/secrets when the project has managed dependencies, credentials, or a real supply-chain exposure; document the selected control.

### Code Rules & Standards

- [ ] Store shared tool configuration in the location supported by the selected toolchain.
- [ ] Add `.editorconfig` or equivalent only when contributors/tools benefit from it.
- [ ] Document non-obvious quality commands and contribution expectations where project documentation is maintained.

### Harness Integration (MANDATORY — Do Not Skip)

**MANDATORY MUST ATTENTION** delegate ALL computational sensor setup to `/linter-setup`:

- Do NOT manually configure linters, formatters, or pre-commit hooks in this skill
- `/linter-setup` handles: tool research → install → configure → pre-commit hooks → CI gates
- `/harness-setup` handles: full harness inventory (feedforward guides + all feedback types)

**WHY:** Code quality tooling is part of the project's outer agent harness. A checklist of installs is not a harness — a harness is a system of guides and sensors where each control fires at the right lifecycle stage and produces signals the agent can consume.

**After scaffold, invoke for applicable selected work (in order):**

1. `/linter-setup` — computational feedback sensors (deterministic, fast, always-on)
2. `/harness-setup` — full harness inventory (all feedforward guides + all feedback sensors)

**Do NOT proceed to `/feature-implement` until both complete.** (`/scaffold` verification gate enforces this)

## Project Foundation Selection (MANDATORY assessment; foundations are conditional)

> **Scaffold Production Readiness** — See the `SYNC:scaffold-production-readiness` block above for the full inline protocol. (Written WITHOUT the HTML-comment delimiters on purpose: a literal open marker in prose is counted as a second opening fence by `sync-update-blocks.py`, which then refuses the file as unbalanced and silently leaves the block stale.)

Assess each concern against the project profile and architecture report. Generate only foundations the runtime, users, delivery model, and real boundaries need; record `NOT-APPLICABLE` with evidence for the rest. Do not create frontend, HTTP, database, container, or integration infrastructure merely to satisfy this checklist. Use project configuration and accepted decisions first, then confirm material choices with the user.

### 1. Code Quality Tooling

Handled by `/linter-setup` skill — do NOT duplicate here.
Verify the configured formatter, linter, type/static analysis, or other applicable quality checks. Require files/hooks only when the chosen toolchain uses them; if missing, invoke `/linter-setup` for that concern.

### 2. Error Handling Foundation

- Select the runtime's error contract and handling boundary from the project profile (for example UI error presentation, API response mapping, CLI exit/reporting, or background-job retry/recovery).
- Add an HTTP interceptor or global handler only when the selected runtime and architecture use one.
- Keep expected business failures distinguishable from unexpected faults; reuse project conventions.
- Run applicable verification checks; do not require a fixed file count.

### 3. Loading State Management

- Apply only when the project has a user-facing interface with asynchronous work.
- Keep pending state with the narrowest useful component/store owner; add shared loading coordination only when multiple views or requests need it.
- Select delay, cancellation, background-request, and progress behavior from user experience requirements and the configured UI pattern.
- Run applicable interaction/state checks; a global HTTP interceptor or shared service is not a default.

### 4. Container / Development Environment (when it fits)

- Use containers/Compose when required by deployment or when they materially improve reproducibility of the runtime/dependencies for this project.
- When selected, generate only the artifacts the target needs (for example an image, Compose topology, ignore rules, or environment example); configure health checks for long-running services and least-privilege image defaults where supported.
- When containers do not fit, document and verify the supported native, managed, device, or other development/test path.
- Verify each execution mode the project supports or promises; do not require both host and container modes universally.

### 5. Integration Points

- Apply when the project has outbound dependencies or separately owned modules/services.
- Document each real boundary; configure timeout, retry, circuit breaking, or idempotency according to that dependency's failure and retry contract.
- Add integration checks for important success and failure outcomes using the project's configured harness.
- Do not add a broker, circuit breaker, or test suite for a boundary the project does not have.

### Scaffold Handoff from Architecture-Design

If an architecture report exists (from `/architecture --mode=design`), read the "Scaffold Handoff — Tool Choices" table and use those selections instead of re-asking the user.

## OOP/SOLID Compliance Rules (when selected by the project)

Apply these checks only when the plan, configuration, or observed architecture selects OOP/SOLID principles. For other paradigms, validate against the project's documented architecture rules instead.

1. **Single Responsibility** — Each base class handles ONE concern
2. **Open/Closed** — Base classes are extensible via inheritance, closed for modification
3. **Liskov Substitution** — Concrete implementations are substitutable for their base
4. **Interface Segregation** — Small, focused interfaces (not one giant IService)
5. **Dependency Inversion** — Keep policy independent from volatile details at real boundaries; use the project's composition mechanism without introducing an interface for every dependency

**Purpose-oriented abstraction naming gate:** Name generated public or cross-layer interfaces, ports, and base abstractions by capability or domain contract; keep provider, SDK, framework, database, and transport details on concrete adapters (`IStorage`/`Storage` → `AzureBlobStorage`). Verify the name against the plan, callers, and implementations, preserve local language syntax, and add an abstraction only for an evidenced boundary, substitution need, or multiple meaningful implementations.

**Anti-patterns to prevent:**

- God classes combining multiple concerns
- Unnecessary concrete coupling at volatile or independently owned boundaries; direct concrete use inside a stable module is acceptable
- Base classes with unused methods that subclasses must override
- Missing generic type parameters where applicable

## Adaptation Protocol

The checklists above are **templates**. Before scaffolding:

1. **Read the plan** — What tech stack was chosen?
2. **Adapt naming** — Match target framework and language conventions
3. **Skip irrelevant items** — Not every project needs every item (e.g., skip IFileStorageService if no file uploads)
4. **Add project-specific items** — The plan may require additional base classes not in the template
5. **Use `ask user question tool`** — Confirm final checklist with user before generating code

## Output

After scaffolding is complete:

1. **Scaffolding Report** — List created files and evidence-backed `NOT-APPLICABLE` decisions
2. **Build Verification** — Run the project's configured build, package, or type-check command when applicable
3. **Architecture Diagram** — Optional; include only when it clarifies the selected architecture
4. **Foundation Verification** — Verify each selected concern; skipped concerns include reasons
5. **Config Files Generated** — List only files selected for this project profile
6. **Golden-Path Examples** — selected, applicable examples under the chosen isolated location, if examples improve adoption
7. **Testability Contract Resolution** — applicable tiers have owner/runner, commands, environment reach, data policy, and evidence-backed applicability

## Verification Gate (MANDATORY before proceeding to /feature-implement)

Verify each selected, applicable foundation from the project readiness protocol:

- [ ] Every category is selected or has an evidence-backed `NOT-APPLICABLE` reason.
- [ ] Selected code quality checks run through the project's chosen local/CI path.
- [ ] The runtime's error contract is covered; UI loading-state checks apply only when the project has asynchronous user-facing UI.
- [ ] Each supported or required execution mode is verified; a second mode is not required without project evidence.
- [ ] Real outbound/integration boundaries and their important success/failure outcomes are covered.
- [ ] `/linter-setup` and `/harness-setup` complete the controls selected for this project.
- [ ] Golden-path examples are present only for selected patterns where they improve adoption, and follow the project's build/test conventions.
- [ ] The testability contract records applicable tiers, commands, environment reach, data policy, and evidence.

**BLOCK proceeding to `/feature-implement` if a selected verification fails or a material applicability decision is unresolved.** Fix issues first, then re-verify.

## Next Steps

**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION — NO EXCEPTIONS** after completing this skill, MUST ATTENTION use `ask user question tool` to present these options. Do NOT skip because the task seems "simple" or "obvious" — the user decides:

- **"/feature-implement (Recommended)"** — Begin implementing feature stories on top of the scaffolding
- **"/workflow-review-changes"** — Review scaffolding code before proceeding
- **"Skip, continue manually"** — user decides

> **[IMPORTANT]** Use `TaskCreate` to break ALL work into small tasks BEFORE starting — including tasks for each file read. This prevents context loss from long files. For simple tasks, AI MUST ATTENTION ask user whether to skip.

> **Evidence Gate:** MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION — every claim, finding, and recommendation requires `file:line` proof or traced evidence with confidence percentage (>80% to act, <80% must verify first).

<!-- PROMPT-ENHANCE:STEP-TASK-CLOSING:START -->

## Prompt-Enhance Closing Anchors

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** follow declared step order for this skill; NEVER skip, reorder, or merge steps without explicit user approval
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** for every step/sub-skill call: set `in_progress` before execution, set `completed` after execution
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** every skipped step MUST include explicit reason; every completed step MUST include concise evidence
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** if Task tools unavailable, maintain an equivalent step-by-step plan tracker with synchronized statuses

<!-- PROMPT-ENHANCE:STEP-TASK-CLOSING:END -->

<!-- SYNC:test-architecture-execution-contract:reminder -->

**MUST ATTENTION** Each assertion-bearing test names the behavior or technical contract it protects and asserts an outcome it owns. Use the project's configured/native test format — Given/When/Then is one valid format, never a framework-wide requirement. When `specArtifacts` is valid, link configured owner/case/variant identity and `intent/contracts` evidence; when absent, name the guarded business intent or technical contract. A malformed declared profile BLOCKS without fallback. Broad test-format migration → assign an owner and next step, never rewrite cases outside scope.

**MUST ATTENTION** Before implementation record evidence-backed applicability for the test types and modes the task/project contract requires: copy-ready full and focused commands where available, zero-match behavior, a useful platform-appropriate entry point, supported execution modes and environments, state-isolation requirements, exact results, and repeat evidence where persistent state makes it relevant. Exercise claimed modes; report a missing required capability as `ENVIRONMENT-BLOCKED`. Never invent production targets or impose a test format. Browser/UI E2E uses the configured runner's waits or project helper for observable readiness and outcomes; apply action pacing only where the project contract specifies it. Reuse the project's evidenced test organization — require a POM, base class, or component taxonomy only when the project actually selects it.

<!-- /SYNC:test-architecture-execution-contract:reminder -->

<!-- SYNC:design-distinctiveness-gate:reminder -->

- **MUST ATTENTION** apply the design distinctiveness gate (`DD-1`–`DD-8`) to any user-facing visual surface: ground it in the named subject/audience/job and confirm when the brief is silent (`DD-1`) · every choice carries a WHY, token names included (`DD-2`) · write a design plan (colour 4–6 named hex · type families+roles+scale · layout prose+ASCII+alignment · principles) then run the BLOCKING generic test and state what you revised BEFORE coding (`DD-3`) · audit every free axis against the T1–T5 tell catalog — cream+serif+`#D97757`, acid-on-black, broadsheet, the SaaS-card kit, template chrome (ALL-CAPS eyebrows, `A · B · C`, spaced-em-dash labels, `#0B0B0B`, mono data labels, trailing `→`) — a match is a missed decision, never a defect (`DD-4`) · 1–2 clearly distinct families, real scale, <80ch, no single-word headline accent / ALL-CAPS labels / redundant eyebrows (`DD-5`) · numbering only on real sequences; hero = the subject's most characteristic thing, not big-number+gradient (`DD-6`) · one orchestrated motion moment, never per-section entrances plus universal card hovers (`DD-7`) · spend boldness once, critique the BUILT page, remove one accessory (`DD-8`). The brief's stated direction OUTRANKS the tell catalog; project design-system docs OUTRANK these clauses — genuine conflicts go to the user, NEVER resolved silently. Cite findings as `DD-<clause>` + `file:line`. Skip ONLY for surfaces with no user-facing visuals, stated explicitly.

<!-- /SYNC:design-distinctiveness-gate:reminder -->

<!-- SYNC:design-review-checklist:reminder -->

- **MUST ATTENTION** when the change/plan/artifact has an applicable user-facing UI surface, READ `.claude/docs/design-review-checklist.md` and run it: `CL-1` establish context first (platform · user · task · metric · constraints · scope · artifacts — state missing context and its confidence impact) · `CL-2` evidence or nothing, cite a location per finding, NEVER invent a measurement (unmeasurable → `NOT VERIFIABLE`), tag `MEASURED`/`OBSERVED`/`HEURISTIC` · `CL-3` rank `P0`–`P4`, cap at top 10 by severity, NEVER pad, concrete fix on every `P0`/`P1` · `CL-4` sweep §A–§N plus §R over whole surfaces (changed files → affected views, composition reconstructed, render or `ENVIRONMENT-BLOCKED`), including surface load B12–B15, container fit E9–E11, §H by usage, Field Necessity Matrix for input, applying only relevant platform/product sections and the WCAG 2.2 AA web baseline plus any stricter applicable legal/project requirement, or the documented standard for other platforms · `CL-5` short on time → use the §P prompts · `CL-6` report in the §O shape · for source code, assess component ownership, base abstractions, reuse, and duplication using the project's documented taxonomy or observed boundaries. Project design-system docs and ADRs OUTRANK the checklist; report a defect ONCE across `UI-*`/`DD-*`/`CL-*`. For a plan, bind only applicable sections and states to acceptance criteria, and name each UI view's primary task, container, information priority, and creation-vs-deferred inputs; a plan review flags a UI phase that omits them. Skip when the work has no user-facing UI surface, and state why.

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** evidence-backed lifecycle/scale/criticality/repo/runtime profile; unknowns take lower tiers. Judge all 7 outcomes: **F1** reproducible build/run/test · **F2** exercise supported/required modes; dual modes only when warranted · **F3** applicable local/CI/production-shaped test portability · **F4** test-strength proof; no universal mutation tool · **F5** measured performance at warranted scale/risk · **F6** build/change scalability at meaningful module boundaries · **F7** stack/profile-fit mechanical checks. Evidence-backed `N/A-by-profile` is valid; prevent over-engineering. Creation blocks warranted omissions; brownfield advises without score changes, with smallest next steps. Catalog: `.claude/docs/engineering-foundation-catalog.md`; update first, re-run `inject_engineering_foundation_gate.py`.

**MUST ATTENTION** capacity work: model demand/SLO and distinguish sessions from RPS/in-flight work; disclose load model and offered vs achieved demand; reduce measured work at a safe owner; preserve cache authorization/freshness/bounds; prove cold-state, overload recovery and justified headroom before scaling. Static review returns a verification plan, not invented throughput. Retain the hosting skill's scores, gates and authority.

## Closing Reminders

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** Testability contract: resolve evidence-backed Unit/Integration/System/E2E rows, copy-ready full/focused commands, zero-match failures, owner/root/data, CI/simple Windows/macOS/Linux entry, unique run identity, and repeat proof before claiming setup, review, or test completion.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION Goal:** Generate a copy-ready architecture foundation that follows the project's chosen paradigm, conventions, and applicable quality gates before feature implementation.

**MUST ATTENTION — Main steps (execute ALL, in order; AI keeps forgetting these):** (1) Read Plan → (2) Generate the applicable Backend and/or Frontend/UI checklist → (3) Validate Against Plan → (4) Present to User via `ask user question tool` → (5) Scaffold only the abstractions and foundations selected by the plan → (6) Verify the project build, chosen architecture, and Verification Gate → invoke `/linter-setup` → `/harness-setup` → `ask user question tool` handoff. NEVER skip, reorder, or merge a step without explicit user approval.

**MUST ATTENTION — Protocols in force (concise digest of the SYNC/shared blocks this skill carries):**

- **Nested Task Creation:** Expand child phases; link parent when nested.
- **Understand Code First:** Grep 3+ patterns, read code before modifying.
- **Project Foundation Selection:** Verify selected foundations; record evidence for skipped categories.
- **Harness Setup:** Verify the selected checks enforce their stated intent; line coverage is diagnostic, not a behavioral quality gate.

**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** check Activation Guards FIRST — proceed ONLY in `workflow-greenfield-init`/`workflow-big-feature` AND when the requirement/owner coverage map identifies missing or unsuitable foundations; otherwise SKIP and mark step completed — why: re-scaffolding an established project duplicates foundations and corrupts existing abstractions.
**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** grep 3+ existing base/abstract/infra patterns (`abstract class.*Base`, `interface I\w+<`, `IRepository`, `base.*component`, DI registration) and cite `file:line` BEFORE generating any scaffolding — skip only when suitable existing foundations cover all planned requirements — why: scaffolding over real foundations is the failure the Activation Guards exist to prevent.
**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** BLOCK `/feature-implement` until the Verification Gate passes — selected foundations are verified or explicitly `NOT-APPLICABLE`, and `/linter-setup` plus `/harness-setup` complete their selected work — why: code shipped without the project's warranted quality gates is technical debt from day one.
**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** delegate ALL sensor setup to `/linter-setup` then `/harness-setup` — NEVER hand-configure linters/formatters/pre-commit hooks in this skill — why: a checklist of installs is not a harness; the harness skills wire each control to its lifecycle stage.
**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** when the chosen architecture uses base abstractions, apply its relevant design principles (including SOLID where appropriate) and keep each base focused — why: an unnecessary or oversized base spreads its design flaw to every dependent feature.
**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** the checklists are TEMPLATES — self-investigate the chosen tech stack, adapt naming to framework conventions, skip irrelevant items, and confirm the final checklist via `ask user question tool` before generating code — NEVER auto-decide scope — why: scaffolding the wrong stack's idioms forces a costly rewrite before any feature lands.
**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** evaluate fit before copying a nearby pattern — closest example ≠ matching preconditions; verify the new context shares the same base classes, scope, and lifetime — why: a foundation lifted from a mismatched context fails silently.
**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** assert that tests protect intended outcomes; use mutation or property tools where the stack and risk justify them, and do not treat line coverage as behavioral proof — why: a test can execute code without asserting its intent.
**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** cite `file:line` proof + confidence % for EVERY claim (>80% to act, <60% DO NOT recommend) — NEVER present a guess as fact — why: speculation without evidence is the root of hallucinated foundations.
**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** break work into small todo tasks using `TaskCreate` BEFORE starting, mark one `in_progress`, mark `completed` immediately after evidence lands, and add a final review todo — why: external task state survives context compaction; memory does not.
**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** after scaffold, present `/feature-implement` vs `/workflow-review-changes` vs skip via `ask user question tool` — the user decides; do NOT skip because it "seems obvious" — why: the user owns the handoff decision.

**Anti-Rationalization (Closing — reject these excuses):**

| Excuse the model tells itself                          | Reality                                                                                          |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| "It's a new feature, just scaffold it"                 | Check Activation Guards first — wrong workflow OR all planned requirements covered by suitable foundations = SKIP and mark completed.  |
| "Already searched for base classes"                    | Show `file:line` grep evidence for all 6 guard patterns. No proof = no search.                    |
| "I'll just configure the linter inline, it's quick"    | NEVER hand-configure sensors — delegate to `/linter-setup` then `/harness-setup`. Installs ≠ harness. |
| "Coverage is high, the foundation is well-tested"      | Line coverage is a diagnostic, not proof. Check whether assertions protect intended outcomes; use mutation tools when they fit. |
| "The stack is obvious, skip the ask user question tool"       | Checklists are templates — confirm the adapted final checklist with the user before generating code. |
| "Found a nearby base class, just copy it"              | Evaluate fit first — same base classes/scope/lifetime? Closest ≠ matching. Verify before reusing.  |
| "Scaffold's done, jump straight to /feature-implement" | BLOCKED until the Verification Gate passes — applicable foundations + `/linter-setup` + `/harness-setup`. |

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** check Activation Guards FIRST (SKIP if every planned requirement has a suitable foundation or wrong workflow) · BLOCK `/feature-implement` until the Verification Gate passes · cite `file:line` + confidence >80% for every claim.

**[TASK-PLANNING]** Before acting, analyze task scope and systematically break it into small todo tasks and sub-tasks using TaskCreate.
