## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Hand the developer a complete, evidence-backed wrap-up — by reviewing current branch changes and summarizing impact/quality — with a change summary, doc/spec staleness flags, root-cause lessons, and a `/understand` review guide (diagrams, user stories, a review path, and how to test/demo it), WITHOUT mutating any file, so they decide the next step from full context.

**Summary:**

- **READ-ONLY contract** — review/summarize current-branch commits and FLAG findings only; NEVER edit, fix, implement, or update the docs or specs you flag — why: watzup is a handoff, not an edit pass.
- **Main steps in order:** (1) **Review** recent commits — what changed/added/removed; (2) **Summarize** impact + quality; (3) **Doc-staleness gate** — path→doc mapping table; (4) **Spec-driven health check** — feature-spec root → spec staleness → feature-docs freshness (ONLY when business code changed); (5) **Root-cause lesson extraction** — surface mistakes → name failure mode (not symptom) → universal rule → ask user; (6) **`/understand` handoff** — the full review guide, mandatory final; (7) **`AskUserQuestion` Next Steps**.
- **Cost, declared:** the `/understand` handoff produces a **fuller artifact than it used to** — it now derives diagrams, resolves real test-case IDs, and builds an ordered review route, so it reads more of the repo and writes a longer report. That is the deliberate price of a wrap-up that ends with a route into the work rather than a recap of it; it is stated here so it is chosen, not discovered.
- **Three required gates** after the change summary: doc-staleness check, spec-driven health check (business-code-only), root-cause lesson extraction — NEVER skip a gate because the change "looks small".
- Lessons go to `/learn` ONLY after user confirmation; surface-level "always check file X" notes are noise, not lessons.
- `/understand` is the mandatory final handoff and MUST run BEFORE the `AskUserQuestion` Next Steps prompt — if unavailable, STOP and report the blocker, NEVER skip — why: the developer's exit context is the explanation, not the raw diff.

**Workflow:**

1. **Review** — Analyze recent commits: what was modified, added, removed
2. **Summarize** — Provide detailed change summary with quality assessment
3. **Doc Check** — Cross-reference changed files against docs/ for staleness
4. **Lesson Learned** — Analyze AI mistakes/issues during the task and capture lessons
5. **Understand Handoff** — Invoke `/understand` as the final mandatory task so the developer gets the full review guide on the completed work, high level first then detail, in four parts: **Orient → Route → Depth → Prove & Push Back**. **The section contract lives in `understand/SKILL.md` Step 4 and is never re-listed here** — a copy of it in this file would go stale silently the next time it changes. Written to `tmp/reports/understand-*.md` — or delivered in full in chat when no git-ignored directory is available for it — and summarized in chat

**Key Rules:**

- READ-ONLY: only flag findings, never implement or fix anything
- Doc staleness check is REQUIRED (see mapping table below)
- Lesson-learned analysis is REQUIRED (see section below)
- Final review task MUST ATTENTION include doc-staleness check, lesson-learned analysis, AND the final `/understand` handoff
- MUST ATTENTION call `/understand` after the watzup summary/doc/mistake analysis and before the final Next Steps prompt

**Be skeptical. Apply critical thinking, sequential thinking. Every claim needs traced proof, confidence percentages (Idea should be more than 80%).**

Review my current branch and the most recent commits.
Provide a detailed summary of all changes, including what was modified, added, or removed.
Analyze the overall impact and quality of the changes.

**IMPORTANT**: Review and summarize only, never start implementing.

## Doc Staleness Check (REQUIRED)

After change summary, run `git diff --name-only` (against base branch or recent commits), cross-reference changed files against relevant docs:

| Changed file pattern    | Docs to check for staleness                                                                   |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `.claude/hooks/**`      | `.claude/docs/hooks/README.md`, hook count tables in `.claude/docs/hooks/*.md`                |
| `.claude/skills/**`     | `.claude/docs/skills/README.md`, skill count/catalog tables                                   |
| `.claude/workflows/**`  | `CLAUDE.md` workflow catalog table, `.claude/docs/` workflow references                       |
| `{configured-service-source-root}/**` | `docs/specs/` doc for the affected service (path from `docs/project-config.json`) |
| `{configured-frontend-source-root}/**` | `frontend-patterns-reference.md` in the project-reference docs root (default `docs/project-reference/`; path from `docsRoots.projectReference.path` in `docs/project-config.json`), relevant business-feature docs |
| `CLAUDE.md`             | `.claude/docs/README.md` (navigation hub must stay in sync)                                   |

**Output one of:**

- A bulleted list of docs that may need updating, with a brief note on what is likely stale (e.g., "hook count changed from 31 to 32").
- `No doc updates needed` — if no changed file pattern maps to a doc.

**Do not edit docs during watzup.** Only flag. The user decides whether to fix.

---

## Spec-Driven Development Health Check (REQUIRED when business code changed)

Run this check when `git diff --name-only` includes ANY changes under the backend service source paths or frontend app/domain source paths (resolve the concrete paths from the project's structure reference / `docs/project-config.json`).

### Step 1 — Feature Spec Root Check

```bash
SPEC_ROOT=docs/specs # default only — read specRoots.business.path from docs/project-config.json first
ls "$SPEC_ROOT"/ 2>/dev/null
```

> **Note:** Results are **app-bucket** names. To find a specific Feature Spec, probe `ls "$SPEC_ROOT"/{app-bucket}/` for canonical `README.{Feature}.md` files and derived bucket indexes/ERDs.

| Result                     | Action                                                                                                                                                                |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Directory missing or empty | ⚠️ Flag (naming the resolved root — default `docs/specs/`, overridden by `specRoots.business.path` in `docs/project-config.json`): `"No Feature Specs found under the business spec root. Consider running /workflow-code-to-spec (mode: init-full) to bootstrap spec-driven documentation for this codebase."` |
| Feature Specs exist        | Proceed to Step 2                                                                                                                                                     |

### Step 2 — Spec Staleness Check (only if bundle exists)

For each spec file in the business spec root (default `docs/specs/`; `specRoots.business.path` in `docs/project-config.json` overrides):

```bash
git log --since="30 days ago" --name-only -- "$SPEC_ROOT"/ | head -10
```

| Result                                                               | Action                                                                                                                                                    |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| No commits in last 30 days AND business code changed in this session | ⚠️ Flag: `"Engineering spec bundle may be stale (no updates in >30 days). Consider running /workflow-code-to-spec (mode: audit) to verify freshness."` |
| Recent commits found                                                 | ✅ Spec bundle is being maintained                                                                                                                        |

### Step 3 — Feature Docs Freshness Check

`$SPEC_ROOT` remains the business spec root resolved in Step 1 (default `docs/specs/`; `specRoots.business.path` in `docs/project-config.json` overrides).

```bash
git log --since="30 days ago" --name-only -- "$SPEC_ROOT"/ | head -10
```

| Result                                               | Action                                                                                  |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| No commits in last 30 days AND business code changed | ⚠️ Flag: `"Business feature docs may be stale. Consider running /docs-update to sync."` |
| Recent commits found                                 | ✅ Feature docs are being maintained                                                    |

**Output only flags that apply. Skip this section entirely if no business code changed.**

## AI Mistake & Lesson Learned Analysis (REQUIRED)

After doc staleness check, review entire session for AI mistakes and lessons learned.

### Step 1 — Surface all mistakes

List every error made during session. For each, note:

- What happened (observable symptom — build fail, test fail, wrong output)
- Where it happened (file:line if applicable)

Common mistake categories:

- Assumed an API/type/enum value existed without reading the source
- Assumed infrastructure availability without checking requirements
- Conflated "code exists" with "code executes" — missed path tracing
- Used a pattern without verifying the new context has the same preconditions
- Reported "done" without verifying ALL affected outputs across all stacks
- Hallucinated method names, class names, or file paths

### Step 2 — Extract root-cause lessons (NOT symptom fixes)

For each mistake, apply this 3-step extraction:

**2a. Name the failure mode** — NOT the symptom, the reasoning failure:

| Symptom (BAD lesson)                       | Failure mode (GOOD lesson)                                                             |
| ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "Used wrong enum value"                    | "Generated code using an assumed API without verifying it exists in the source"        |
| "Wrong namespace in using"                 | "Assumed project setup without reading project-specific configuration files first"     |
| "Happy-path assertion failed in CI"        | "Wrote assertions without tracing what infrastructure the handler requires at runtime" |
| "Set properties that don't exist on query" | "Assumed all types in a hierarchy share the same interface without reading base class" |

**2b. Find the class** — Where else could this SAME failure mode strike?

If failure mode applies in only one specific file or case → go up one abstraction level until it generalizes. Good lesson applies to ≥3 different contexts.

**2c. Write as a universal rule** — Strip ALL project-specific names:

- No file paths, class names specific to this codebase, or tool names
- Must read as useful advice on a completely different codebase in a different language
- If multiple mistakes share the same failure mode → consolidate into ONE lesson
- Test: "Would this prevent the same class of mistake in a Java, Go, or Python project?" If yes → good. If no → rewrite.

### Step 3 — Ask user to persist

> "Found [N] root-cause lesson(s). Should I use `/learn` to save them for future sessions?"

Wait for user confirmation before invoking `/learn`.

**Output one of:**

- A numbered list: failure mode → universal lesson → proposed `/learn` text
- `No AI mistakes identified in this session` — if genuinely none found

**Be honest and self-critical.** Surface-level symptom fixes ("always check file X") applying only to this codebase are NOT lessons — they are noise. Purpose: root-cause prevention compounding across sessions.

## Next Steps

**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION — NO EXCEPTIONS** before presenting these options, invoke `/understand` as the final mandatory todo task using the watzup summary and current change set as scope. If `/understand` is unavailable, stop and report that blocker instead of silently skipping the handoff.

After `/understand` completes, MUST ATTENTION use `AskUserQuestion` to present these options. NEVER skip because task seems "simple" or "obvious" — the user decides:

- **"/workflow-end (Recommended)"** — Complete and close the active workflow
- **"/commit"** — Commit changes if not using workflow
- **"Skip, continue manually"** — user decides

> **[IMPORTANT]** Use `TaskCreate` to break ALL work into small tasks BEFORE starting — including tasks for each file read. This prevents context loss from long files. For simple tasks, AI MUST ATTENTION ask user whether to skip.

> **External Memory:** For complex or lengthy work (research, analysis, scan, review), write intermediate findings and final results to a report file in `tmp/reports/` — prevents context loss and serves as deliverable.

> **Evidence Gate:** MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION — every claim, finding, and recommendation requires `file:line` proof or traced evidence with confidence percentage (>80% to act, <80% must verify first).

<!-- SYNC:nested-task-creation -->

> **Nested Task Expansion Contract** — For workflow-step invocation, the `[Workflow] ...` row is only a parent container; the child skill still creates visible phase tasks.
>
> 1. Call `TaskList` first. If a matching active parent workflow row exists, set `nested=true` and record `parentTaskId`; otherwise run standalone.
> 2. Create one task per declared phase before phase work. When nested, prefix subjects `[N.M] /skill-name — phase`.
> 3. When nested, link the parent with `TaskUpdate(parentTaskId, addBlockedBy: [childIds])`.
> 4. Orchestrators must pre-expand a child skill's phase list and link the workflow row before invoking that child skill or sub-agent.
> 5. Mark exactly one child `in_progress` before work and `completed` immediately after evidence is written.
> 6. Complete the parent only after all child tasks are completed or explicitly cancelled with reason.
>
> **Blocked until:** `TaskList` done, child phases created, parent linked when nested, first child marked `in_progress`.

<!-- SYNC:project-reference-docs-guide -->

> **Project Reference Docs Gate (static JIT)** — Run after task-tracking bootstrap and immediately before target/source file reads, grep, edits, tests, or analysis. Project docs override generic framework assumptions; hooks may remind or accelerate this gate, but never prove that it ran.
>
> 1. Identify scope: file types, domain area, and operation.
> 2. **Read the configured project-config file first, if it exists.** Resolve its path through the project-config loader (default `docs/project-config.json`). **The project config is OPTIONAL: a project with no config is a supported, first-class state, not an error.** When it is absent, run on the framework's portable defaults and derive project facts (paths, run commands, conventions, architecture, test and spec layout) from repository evidence — manifests, lockfiles, scripts, CI definitions, directory layout, root instruction files — stating the assumption whenever one is material; do not block, and do not demand a bootstrap route before ordinary work. When it IS present, the minimum valid shape has a non-empty `project.name`; omitted optional capability properties use neutral defaults or skip that capability. A section its author DECLARED but left malformed or incomplete is a configuration error: fail closed on that section and run `/project-init` or `/project-config` before relying on it, because silently substituting defaults would present wrong project facts as authoritative. Use valid config for the adopter's paths, commands, architecture, specs, tests, and workflows, then verify material hints against repository evidence; never assume generic defaults are project facts.
> 3. **Always-on vs task-specific references:** Project initialization owns and ensures the project's `lessons.md` and docs-index inputs at their configured owner paths. Read them under the static project-context contract independently of task-specific `referenceDocs`; do not append them to that selection. For task-specific docs, when the configured `referenceDocs` property is an array, follow it exactly, including subsets and `[]`. When absent, use the runtime capability-aware resolver: its portable baseline plus only configuration- or repository-evidenced capabilities; a minimal project with no capability evidence may resolve to an empty task-specific set. The full scan-target manifest is a registry of metadata/aliases, not a default selection. Resolve configured paths using `docsRoots.projectReference.path` when present (default `docs/project-reference`; `docsRoots.projectReference.path` in `docs/project-config.json` overrides it). A custom reference doc declares `filename` and `purpose`, with optional `sections`, `templatePath`, and `scanTarget`. Built-in filenames keep their exact framework-owned target; other custom docs default to manual ownership, while `scanTarget: "generic"` opts one exact selected file into evidence-based scanning. Manual docs are not freshness-tracked or impact-routed. Never infer a target by basename; config and runtime path resolution reject lexical traversal and physical symlink escapes.
> 4. Read selected task-specific docs just in time before target work, then state: `Reference docs read: ... | Not applicable: ...`; an explicit empty selection means no task-specific docs are selected by the catalog. Still honor separately required references named by the active skill or task. An absent project config is not a missing doc: proceed on repository evidence and, at most, OFFER `/project-init` or `/project-config` as an optional one-time recording of those facts. If an always-on input or a selected/otherwise required doc is missing or stale, or a declared config section is malformed, use `/project-init` or the narrow owner route (`/project-config`, `/docs-init`, `/scan --target=<key>`, `/ai-context-refresh`) before relying on that input. If Codex mirrors are stale, use the explicit `/sync-codex` route or its documented `/ai-context-refresh` completion handoff for the active source-authoring task. After compaction, resume, delegation, or material context change, repeat selection and reading; prior conversation and hook output are not proof of current loading.
>
> **Ready when:** scope evaluated, the configured project-config file consulted or its absence recorded and the portable-defaults fallback applied, root always-on inputs are confirmed (completing project initialization if they are missing or stale), the declared task-specific `referenceDocs` selection is applied exactly or, when absent, the runtime capability-aware resolver output is applied (which may be empty), selected docs are read or an explicit empty selection is recorded, and the citation emitted.

> **AI Mistake Prevention** — Failure modes to avoid on every task:
>
> **Project applicability gate.** Before applying a stack, layer, style, tool, or architecture rule, read the project's config and relevant references, then check local implementations. Treat framework examples as examples; honor explicit N/A and do not require a technology or convention the project does not use.
> **ROOT-CAUSE GATE — INVESTIGATE FIRST.** Before applying any project-related correction, always use the project's root-cause investigation protocol and establish the cause; the failure site may be only a symptom.
> **FAILED-TEST GATE.** For any failed or unstable test, use the project's test-investigation protocol before editing source or tests; never change either side merely to force green.
> **Re-read files after context changes.** Context compaction, resume, or long-running work can make memory stale; verify current files before acting.
> **Verify generated content against source evidence.** AI hallucinates APIs, names, claims, and document facts. Check the relevant source before documenting or referencing.
> **Check downstream references before deleting or renaming.** Removing an artifact can stale docs, generated mirrors, configs, and callers; map references first.
> **Trace the full impact chain after edits.** Changing a definition can miss derived outputs and consumers. Follow the affected chain before declaring done.
> **Verify ALL affected outputs, not just the first.** One green check is not all green checks; validate every output surface the change can affect.
> **Assume existing values are intentional — ask WHY before changing OR flagging one as a defect.** Before changing or reporting a constant, limit, flag, cutoff, wording, or pattern, read nearby context and history, the CALLER's ordering, and 2+ sibling call sites of the same convention. A doc stating WHAT without WHY is missing rationale, not proof of a missing guard.
> **Surface ambiguity before acting — don't pick silently.** Multiple valid interpretations require an explicit question or stated assumption with risk.
> **Assert the outcome your system owns, not the intermediate state your infrastructure owns.** When verifying async work, assert the final business state — never the delivery/retry bookkeeping held in shared infrastructure that any co-running process can write. Such a check passes when run alone and flakes the moment anything else shares that infrastructure.
> **Store disposable generated output in the project workspace.** If an output can be regenerated and is not source code, a canonical source-of-truth, or an intentionally versioned projection, write it under the project-root `tmp/` or `temp/` directory (prefer `tmp/`), scoped to the run. This includes temporary state, integration/E2E results, reports, logs, screenshots, traces, videos, coverage, dumps, and candidate evidence. Never put these outputs in source, docs, the plans root (default `plans/`; a `docsRoots.plans.path` entry in `docs/project-config.json` overrides the path), the team-artifacts root (default `team-artifacts/`; `docsRoots.teamArtifacts.path` in the same config overrides the path), or mirror directories; the project-root `.gitignore` must ignore `/tmp/` and `/temp/` by default. Committed fixtures, accepted baselines, canonical specs/docs, and explicitly versioned generated mirrors remain at their declared owner paths.
> **Judge the environment before judging the code.** A bug report, failed test, error, or unexpected output is not proof of a code defect. Before and during adjudication, weigh environment causes as a competing hypothesis — setup, config, version and dependency state, service dependencies, stale artifacts or leftover state, and transient resource pressure (RAM, CPU, disk, handles, network). State the discriminator you ran; fix an environment cause in the environment, never by editing product code or weakening a test to absorb it.
> **Keep shared guidance role-relevant.** Universal guidance must help every receiving skill or agent; code-specific obligations belong only in code-specific protocols.

- **MANDATORY** Bootstrap task tracking before target work; transition one task at a time.
- **MANDATORY** Persist plan/review findings to `tmp/reports/` incrementally and synthesize from disk.

<!-- /SYNC:task-tracking-external-report:reminder -->

<!-- SYNC:project-reference-docs-guide:reminder -->

- **MANDATORY** Before project-specific work, load the OPTIONAL project-config (default `docs/project-config.json`) via its loader. No config is supported — fall back to portable defaults plus repository evidence, state material assumptions, never block. When present: require non-empty `project.name`, use neutral defaults/skips for omitted optional capabilities, and fail closed on a declared malformed section.
- **MANDATORY** Apply an explicit `referenceDocs` array exactly, including `[]`; when absent use only the capability-aware resolver output, which may be empty. Cite `Reference docs read: ...` and note the selected or empty set.
- **MANDATORY** Load detail JUST IN TIME, immediately before the first target read/grep/edit/test — a hook event or a prior turn is NEVER evidence that the current files were read. Re-resolve selection and re-read after compaction, resume, delegation, or a context change.
- **MANDATORY** The project-init-owned `lessons.md` and docs-index inputs are always-on at their configured owner paths, read independently of task-specific `referenceDocs`. A missing/stale root instruction file or required reference doc, or a malformed declared config section → auto-run `/project-init` (or the narrow lower-level route) before relying on that input. An absent config never gates work — offer `/project-init` or `/project-config` once. Project config and conventions override generic framework defaults.

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** for every step/sub-skill call: set `in_progress` before execution, set `completed` after execution
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** every skipped step MUST include explicit reason; every completed step MUST include concise evidence
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** if Task tools unavailable, maintain an equivalent step-by-step plan tracker with synchronized statuses

> **Project Protocol Overlay** — Before executing this skill, resolve project overlays from the index at `<docsRoots.projectReference.path>/skill-protocols-reference.md` (default `docs/project-reference/`; `docsRoots.projectReference.path` in `docs/project-config.json` overrides it). A matching `referenceDocs[]` filename may relocate the index within that root; this registry is independent from task-specific reference-doc selection, so omitted or empty `referenceDocs` does not disable it. The index's `**Protocols directory:**` header selects a project-root-relative body directory (default `docs/project-protocols/`). Match this skill against the `Target` column and take the most specific tier ONLY — exact name > glob > `*`. **That precedence orders overlays against EACH OTHER, never against this skill.** Read only matched bodies derived as `<protocols-dir>/<Name>.md`; the row's Body link is display text, never a read path. Reject unsafe paths without reading. A matched body that is missing or malformed is REPORTED and skipped — never reconstructed from the index Description. An absent index or no match -> proceed with no overlay, silently. Full contract: `.claude/skills/project-skill-protocol/references/registry.md`.
>
> Overlays are **ADDITIVE ONLY**: they ADD rules on top of this skill's own protocol and NEVER replace, override, disable, or reinterpret a rule it already states — removing every overlay must return this skill to exactly its documented behavior. An overlay is a BRIEF, not an authority escalation: it can NEVER waive a workflow gate, git discipline, a review gate, or a user-confirmation gate. A genuine overlay-vs-skill conflict, or two equally-specific overlays that directly contradict -> surface both to the user; NEVER resolve silently.

**MUST ATTENTION** resolve this skill's overlays from the index at `<docsRoots.projectReference.path>/skill-protocols-reference.md` (default `docs/project-reference/`; `docsRoots.projectReference.path` in `docs/project-config.json` overrides it); an empty task `referenceDocs` does NOT disable this lookup. Read ONLY matched bodies from the directory the index header names (default `docs/project-protocols/`). Specificity (exact > glob > `*`) ranks overlays against EACH OTHER, never against the skill. Missing/malformed body → report and skip; no index or no match → proceed silently. Overlays are ADDITIVE ONLY — never an authority escalation or a gate waiver; equal-tier contradiction goes to the user.

## Closing Reminders

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION Goal:** Hand the developer a complete, evidence-backed wrap-up — by reviewing current branch changes and summarizing impact/quality — with a change summary, doc/spec staleness flags, root-cause lessons, and a `/understand` review guide (diagrams, user stories, a review path, and how to test/demo it), WITHOUT mutating any file, so they decide the next step from full context.

**Protocols in force (concise digest of the SYNC/shared blocks this skill carries):**

- **Nested Task Creation:** Expand child phases, link parent, one task in_progress.
- **Project Reference Docs Guide:** Read required project-reference docs (always lessons.md) before work.
- **Task Tracking External Report:** Bootstrap task tracking; persist findings to tmp/reports/ incrementally.
- **Critical Thinking:** Critical + sequential thinking; traced proof, no guess-as-fact.
- **Evidence:** Cite file:line for every claim; never speculate.
- **AI Mistake Prevention:** verify generated content against evidence, trace downstream references, verify all affected outputs, re-read after context loss, surface ambiguity.

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** stay READ-ONLY — only FLAG findings; NEVER edit, fix, implement, or update the docs or specs you flag — why: watzup is a review/handoff, not an edit pass; flagging-then-fixing silently breaks the read-only contract.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** run ALL three required gates after the change summary — doc-staleness (path→doc table), spec-driven health check (only when business code changed), root-cause lesson extraction — NEVER skip a gate because the change "looks small" — why: stale docs and missed lessons compound silently across sessions.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** invoke `/understand` as the FINAL mandatory handoff BEFORE the `AskUserQuestion` Next Steps prompt; if `/understand` is unavailable, STOP and report the blocker — NEVER silently skip the handoff — why: the developer's exit context is the explanation, not the raw diff.

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** extract lessons by ROOT CAUSE (the reasoning/assumption failure), NOT the symptom; write each as a universal rule that holds on ≥3 codebases; surface-level "always check file X" notes are noise — why: only root-cause prevention compounds across sessions.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** send lessons to `/learn` ONLY after explicit user confirmation — NEVER auto-persist or self-edit instruction files — why: lesson capture is a durable instruction change the user must own.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** use `AskUserQuestion` for the Next Steps decision — NEVER auto-decide the route even when it "seems obvious" — why: the user owns the workflow-end / commit / continue choice.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** break work into small todo tasks with `TaskCreate` BEFORE starting (one task per file read), keep exactly one `in_progress`, and add a final review todo to verify work quality — why: long files exhaust context; granular tasks survive compaction.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** cite `file:line` proof or traced evidence with a confidence % for every claim/finding (>80% to act, <80% verify first) — NEVER present a guess as fact — why: an unverified staleness/lesson flag misleads the developer's next decision.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** grep/glob to verify any referenced doc, path, or API actually exists before flagging it — NEVER hallucinate a doc mapping or count — why: AI invents file paths and method names; the change summary must match the real diff.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** read `CLAUDE.md` and the project-reference docs gate (`lessons.md` always) before the wrap-up — why: project conventions override generic staleness assumptions.

**Anti-Rationalization:**

| Evasion                                          | Rebuttal                                                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "Doc looks fine, skip the staleness gate"        | Run the path→doc table anyway — staleness is silent; flag or output `No doc updates needed`.   |
| "No real mistakes this session, skip lessons"    | Still run the gate — output `No AI mistakes identified` only after honest self-review.         |
| "It's obvious next they want a commit, just do it" | NEVER auto-decide — present the `AskUserQuestion` options; the user owns the route.           |
| "I can just fix this stale doc while I'm here"    | READ-ONLY — flag only. Fixing here breaks the contract; the user decides.                      |
| "Small change, skip `/understand`"               | `/understand` is the mandatory handoff — run it or report the blocker; never skip.             |

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION Goal echo:** Hand the developer a complete, evidence-backed wrap-up — by reviewing current branch changes and summarizing impact/quality — with a change summary, doc/spec staleness flags, root-cause lessons, and a `/understand` review guide (diagrams, user stories, a review path, and how to test/demo it), WITHOUT mutating any file, so they decide the next step from full context.
