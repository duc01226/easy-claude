## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Analyze npm package dependencies, research latest versions and breaking changes, and generate a phased upgrade plan.

**Workflow:**

1. **Inventory** — Discover all package.json files, catalog dependencies and usage
2. **Web Research** — Batch-research latest versions, breaking changes, migration guides (groups of 10)
3. **Risk Assessment** — Categorize risk (Critical/High/Medium/Low), build dependency upgrade order
4. **Report** — Generate comprehensive upgrade report with phased migration plan
5. **Approval Gate** — Present report for user confirmation before any action

**Key Rules:**

- Must read anti-hallucination protocols before executing
- Research only from official sources (npm, GitHub, official docs)
- Declare confidence level; if < 90%, request user verification

**Be skeptical. Apply critical thinking, sequential thinking. Every claim needs traced proof, confidence percentages (Idea should be more than 80%).**

# Frontend Package Upgrade Analysis & Planning

You are to operate as an expert frontend package management specialist, npm ecosystem analyst, and software architecture expert to analyze package.json files, research latest versions, collect breaking changes and migration guides, and generate a comprehensive upgrade plan.

**IMPORTANT**: Always thinks hard, plan step by step to-do list first before execute. Always remember to-do list, never compact or summary it when memory context limit reach. Always preserve and carry your to-do list through every operation.

---

## PHASE 1: PACKAGE INVENTORY & CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS

Build package inventory in `tmp/analysis/frontend-package-upgrade-analysis.md`.

### PHASE 1A: INITIALIZATION AND PACKAGE DISCOVERY

Initialize analysis file with:

- `## Metadata` - Original prompt and task description
- `## Progress` - Track phase, items processed, total items
- `## Package Inventory` - All package.json files and dependencies
- `## Version Research Results` - Latest versions and changelogs
- `## Breaking Changes Analysis` - Breaking changes catalog
- `## Migration Complexity Assessment` - Risk levels and effort estimates
- `## Upgrade Strategy` - Phased migration plan

**Find all package.json files**:

```
<frontend-workspace>/package.json
<frontend-workspace>/apps/*/package.json
<frontend-workspace>/libs/*/package.json
```

For each package.json, document:

- Project Name & Location
- Framework Version
- Dependencies (categorized: Framework, UI, Build Tools, Testing, Utilities)
- DevDependencies

Create **Master Package List** consolidating all unique packages.

### PHASE 1B: PACKAGE USAGE ANALYSIS

For each unique package, analyze codebase usage:

- **Projects Using**: Which projects depend on this
- **Import Count**: Number of files importing
- **Key Usage Areas**: Where primarily used
- **Configuration Files**: Config files for this package
- **Upgrade Risk Level**: Low/Medium/High/Critical based on usage breadth

---

## PHASE 2: WEB RESEARCH & VERSION DISCOVERY

**IMPORTANT: BATCH INTO GROUPS OF 10**

For EACH package in Master Package List:

### Latest Version Discovery

- Search: "[package-name] npm latest version"
- Check: https://www.npmjs.com/package/[package-name]
- Extract: Latest stable version, release date, downloads

### Breaking Changes Research

- Search: "[package-name] migration guide [old-version] to [new-version]"
- Search: "[package-name] v[X] breaking changes"
- Search: "[package-name] changelog"
- GitHub: Check CHANGELOG.md, releases

### Ecosystem Compatibility

- Frontend framework version compatibility
- Check peerDependencies
- Cross-package dependencies

Document:

- Current vs. Latest versions
- Version gap (major/minor/patch versions behind)
- Breaking changes with migration steps
- Deprecation warnings
- Peer dependency changes

---

## PHASE 3: RISK ASSESSMENT & PRIORITIZATION

### Risk Categories

- **Critical Risk**: 5+ major versions behind, framework packages, 50+ breaking changes
- **High Risk**: 3-4 major versions, state management, 20-30 breaking changes
- **Medium Risk**: 1-2 major versions, some breaking changes
- **Low Risk**: Patch/minor updates, backward compatible

### Dependency Graph (Upgrade Order)

1. Foundation packages (Node.js, TypeScript)
2. Framework packages (core packages, CLI/build tooling)
3. Framework extensions (Material, RxJS)
4. Third-party libraries
5. Dev tools last

---

## PHASE 4: COMPREHENSIVE REPORT GENERATION

Generate report at `ai_package_upgrade_reports/[YYYY-MM-DD]-frontend-package-upgrade-report.md`:

### Report Structure

1. **Executive Summary**
2. **Package Inventory by Project**
3. **Version Gap Analysis**
4. **Breaking Changes Catalog**
5. **Migration Complexity Assessment**
6. **Ecosystem Compatibility Analysis**
7. **Recommended Upgrade Strategy** (Phased Migration Plan)
8. **Detailed Migration Guides**
9. **Testing Strategy**
10. **Rollback Plan**
11. **Timeline & Resource Estimation**
12. **Appendices**

---

## PHASE 5: APPROVAL GATE

**CRITICAL**: Present comprehensive package upgrade report for explicit approval. **DO NOT** proceed without it.

---

## PHASE 6: CONFIDENCE DECLARATION

Before marking complete, provide:

### Solution Confidence Assessment

**Overall Confidence**: [High 90-100% / Medium 70-89% / Low <70%]

**Evidence Summary**:

- All package.json files discovered: [count]
- Web research completed: [X/Y packages]
- Breaking changes documented: [count]
- Official sources used: npm, GitHub, official docs

**Assumptions Made**: [List or "None"]

**User Confirmation Needed**:

- IF confidence < 90%: "Please verify [specific packages] before proceeding"
- IF confidence >= 90%: "Analysis is comprehensive, ready for migration"

---

## Package Upgrade Guidelines

- **Comprehensive Discovery**: Find ALL package.json files
- **Web Research Accuracy**: Use official sources only (npm, GitHub, official docs)
- **Breaking Changes Focus**: Prioritize identifying breaking changes requiring code changes
- **Risk Assessment**: Evaluate complexity based on breaking changes, usage breadth, dependencies
- **Practical Planning**: Create actionable phased plan with realistic effort estimates
- **Evidence-Based Decisions**: Base ALL recommendations on actual research with sources cited
- **Confidence Declaration**: Declare confidence level; if < 90%, request user confirmation
- **Batch Processing**: Research packages in batches of 10

> **[IMPORTANT]** Use `TaskCreate` to break ALL work into small tasks BEFORE starting — including tasks for each file read. This prevents context loss from long files. For simple tasks, AI MUST ATTENTION ask user whether to skip.

<!-- SYNC:source-test-drift-check -->

> **Source/test drift check.** For coding, fix, debug, investigation, test, or review work: when source behavior changes, inspect affected unit/integration/E2E tests and decide from evidence whether tests should change to match intended behavior or the source change is an unintended bug to fix. Do not write tests for migration code; schema/data migrations are one-time execution paths, not core application logic.

<!-- /SYNC:source-test-drift-check -->

<!-- SYNC:ai-mistake-prevention -->

> **AI Mistake Prevention** — Failure modes to avoid on every task:
>
> **Project applicability gate.** Before applying a stack, layer, style, tool, or architecture rule, read the project's config and relevant references, then check local implementations. Treat framework examples as examples; honor explicit N/A and do not require a technology or convention the project does not use.
> **ROOT-CAUSE GATE — INVESTIGATE FIRST.** Before applying any project-related correction, always use the project's root-cause investigation protocol and establish the cause; the failure site may be only a symptom.
> **FAILED-TEST GATE.** For any failed or unstable test, use the project's test-investigation protocol before editing source or tests; never change either side merely to force green.
> **Re-read files after context changes.** Context compaction, resume, or long-running work can make memory stale; verify current files before acting.
> **Verify generated content against source evidence.** AI hallucinates APIs, names, claims, and document facts. Check the relevant source before documenting or referencing.
> **Check downstream references before deleting or renaming.** Removing an artifact can stale docs, generated mirrors, configs, and callers; map references first.
> **Trace the full impact chain after edits.** Changing a definition can miss derived outputs and consumers. Follow the affected chain before declaring done.
> **Verify ALL affected outputs, not just the first.** One green check is not all green checks; validate every output surface the change can affect.
> **Assume existing values are intentional — ask WHY before changing OR flagging one as a defect.** Before changing or reporting a constant, limit, flag, cutoff, wording, or pattern, read nearby context and history, the CALLER's ordering, and 2+ sibling call sites of the same convention. A doc stating WHAT without WHY is missing rationale, not proof of a missing guard.
> **Surface ambiguity before acting — don't pick silently.** Multiple valid interpretations require an explicit question or stated assumption with risk.
> **Assert the outcome your system owns, not the intermediate state your infrastructure owns.** When verifying async work, assert the final business state — never the delivery/retry bookkeeping held in shared infrastructure that any co-running process can write. Such a check passes when run alone and flakes the moment anything else shares that infrastructure.
> **Store disposable generated output in the project workspace.** If an output can be regenerated and is not source code, a canonical source-of-truth, or an intentionally versioned projection, write it under the project-root `tmp/` or `temp/` directory (prefer `tmp/`), scoped to the run. This includes temporary state, integration/E2E results, reports, logs, screenshots, traces, videos, coverage, dumps, and candidate evidence. Never put these outputs in source, docs, the plans root (default `plans/`; a `docsRoots.plans.path` entry in `docs/project-config.json` overrides the path), the team-artifacts root (default `team-artifacts/`; `docsRoots.teamArtifacts.path` in the same config overrides the path), or mirror directories; the project-root `.gitignore` must ignore `/tmp/` and `/temp/` by default. Committed fixtures, accepted baselines, canonical specs/docs, and explicitly versioned generated mirrors remain at their declared owner paths.
> **Judge the environment before judging the code.** A bug report, failed test, error, or unexpected output is not proof of a code defect. Before and during adjudication, weigh environment causes as a competing hypothesis — setup, config, version and dependency state, service dependencies, stale artifacts or leftover state, and transient resource pressure (RAM, CPU, disk, handles, network). State the discriminator you ran; fix an environment cause in the environment, never by editing product code or weakening a test to absorb it.
> **Keep shared guidance role-relevant.** Universal guidance must help every receiving skill or agent; code-specific obligations belong only in code-specific protocols.

<!-- SYNC:evidence-based-reasoning -->

> **Evidence-Based Reasoning** — Do not present inference as fact; ground material claims in evidence appropriate to the task.
>
> 1. Cite `file:line` for repository claims, configuration or reference paths for project rules, and URLs or artifact locations for external or observed claims.
> 2. State confidence when a conclusion is uncertain; verify material assumptions before acting and withhold recommendations when evidence is insufficient.
> 3. Trace the consumers, boundaries, or dependencies that exist in the affected path; do not assume services, modules, or architectural styles that the project does not use.
> 4. "I don't have enough evidence" is valid and expected output.
>
> **BLOCKED until:** material claims have traceable evidence, relevant searches are complete, and uncertainties are stated. Search comparable patterns when the task has existing implementations; record when none are available.
>
> **Forbidden without proof:** "obviously", "I think", "should be", "probably", "this is because"
> **If incomplete →** output: `"Insufficient evidence. Verified: [...]. Not verified: [...]."`

<!-- SYNC:critical-thinking-mindset -->

> **Critical Thinking Mindset** — Apply critical thinking, sequential thinking. Every claim needs traced proof, confidence >80% to act.
> **Anti-hallucination:** Never present guess as fact — cite sources for every claim, admit uncertainty freely, self-check output for errors, cross-reference independently, stay skeptical of own confidence — certainty without evidence root of all hallucination.

<!-- /SYNC:critical-thinking-mindset -->

<!-- SYNC:project-reference-docs-guide -->

> **Project Reference Docs Gate (static JIT)** — Run after task-tracking bootstrap, immediately before target/source reads, grep, edits, tests, or analysis. Project docs override generic framework assumptions; hooks may remind or accelerate this gate but never prove it ran.
>
> 1. **Scope** — identify file types, domain area, and operation.
> 2. **Project config is OPTIONAL.** Read the configured project-config file via its loader (default `docs/project-config.json`) when it exists. Absent is a supported state, not an error: run on portable defaults, derive project facts (paths, commands, conventions, architecture, test/spec layout) from repository evidence (manifests, lockfiles, scripts, CI, layout, root instruction files), state material assumptions, never block, and at most OFFER `/project-init` or `/project-config` once. Present → minimum valid shape is a non-empty `project.name`; omitted optional capabilities use neutral defaults or skip. A DECLARED section left malformed or incomplete is a configuration error: fail closed on it and run `/project-init` or `/project-config` before relying on it — why: silent defaults would present wrong facts as authoritative. Verify material config hints against repository evidence; generic defaults are never project facts.
> 3. **Select docs.** Always-on: the project-init-owned `lessons.md` and docs-index inputs at their configured owner paths — read independently, never appended to `referenceDocs`. Task-specific: an explicit `referenceDocs` array is the exact selection, subsets and `[]` included; absent → the runtime capability-aware resolver (portable baseline plus configuration- or repository-evidenced capabilities; may be empty). The scan-target manifest is a registry, not a default selection. Filenames resolve under the reference-docs root (default `docs/project-reference`; `docsRoots.projectReference.path` in `docs/project-config.json` overrides it). Custom-doc schema, ownership, and path-safety rules: `.claude/skills/scan/references/targets.md`.
> 4. **Route by phase.** Just in time, read the selected docs the table names for the phase you are ABOUT to enter, plus any selected custom doc whose `purpose` covers that phase. An unmatched row is `Not applicable`, never a blocker.
>
> | About to… | Read first (when selected and present) |
> | --- | --- |
> | investigate, explain, plan, design, estimate | `project-structure-reference.md`, `domain-entities-reference.md`, plus the edit-row docs for every file type the plan will touch |
> | edit or write code | `code-review-rules.md`, plus server-side / non-UI code → `backend-patterns-reference.md`; UI → `frontend-patterns-reference.md`, `scss-styling-guide.md`, `design-system/README.md` |
> | write, run, fix, or review tests or test data | the matching kind: `integration-test-reference.md` · `e2e-test-reference.md` · `seed-test-data-reference.md` |
> | author or change specs, test cases, or docs | `feature-spec-reference.md`, `spec-system-reference.md`, `spec-principles.md`; `workflow-spec-test-code-cycle-reference.md` when specs, tests, and code must stay in sync |
> | review a diff, plan, spec, or artifact | `code-review-rules.md`, plus the edit/test/spec-row docs for every file type under review |
>
> 5. **Per-file conventions** (`contextGroups[]` in the project config) add rules for the exact file read or edited: hooks deliver them where they run; elsewhere run `node .claude/hooks/lib/file-conventions.cjs --lookup <path>` before the first edit of an unfamiliar path class.
> 6. **Cite and repair.** State `Reference docs read: ... | Not applicable: ...` (record an explicit empty selection); still honor references the active skill or task requires. A missing/stale always-on input or selected/required doc, or a malformed declared config section → `/project-init` or the narrow owner route (`/project-config`, `/docs-init`, `/scan --target=<key>`, `/ai-context-refresh`) before relying on it.
> 7. **Dedup within ~200K tokens.** A doc counts as loaded only when its full content came back to THIS context from your own read, after the last compaction and within roughly the last 200K tokens, and it has not changed since — list it in `Reference docs read:` as `<doc> (loaded)` and skip the re-read. Everything else is not loaded: a hook reminder, a summary, a doc merely named in the conversation, or a read by another agent. Re-select and re-read after compaction, resume, a material context change, or ~200K tokens of growth (= the file-convention hook default). A delegated sub-agent starts empty: name the resolved doc paths in its brief.
>
> **Ready when:** scope set · config read or its absence recorded · always-on inputs confirmed · selection applied (may be empty) · phase docs read or cited `(loaded)` · citation emitted.

<!-- SYNC:project-protocol-overlay -->

> **Project Protocol Overlay** — Before executing this skill, resolve project overlays from the index at `<docsRoots.projectReference.path>/skill-protocols-reference.md` (default `docs/project-reference/`; `docsRoots.projectReference.path` in `docs/project-config.json` overrides it). A matching `referenceDocs[]` filename may relocate the index within that root; this registry is independent from task-specific reference-doc selection, so omitted or empty `referenceDocs` does not disable it. The index's `**Protocols directory:**` header selects a project-root-relative body directory (default `docs/project-protocols/`). Match this skill against the `Target` column and take the most specific tier ONLY — exact name > glob > `*`. **That precedence orders overlays against EACH OTHER, never against this skill.** Read only matched bodies derived as `<protocols-dir>/<Name>.md`; the row's Body link is display text, never a read path. Reject unsafe paths without reading. A matched body that is missing or malformed is REPORTED and skipped — never reconstructed from the index Description. An absent index or no match -> proceed with no overlay, silently. Full contract: `.claude/skills/project-skill-protocol/references/registry.md`.
>
> Overlays are **ADDITIVE ONLY**: they ADD rules on top of this skill's own protocol and NEVER replace, override, disable, or reinterpret a rule it already states — removing every overlay must return this skill to exactly its documented behavior. An overlay is a BRIEF, not an authority escalation: it can NEVER waive a workflow gate, git discipline, a review gate, or a user-confirmation gate. A genuine overlay-vs-skill conflict, or two equally-specific overlays that directly contradict -> surface both to the user; NEVER resolve silently.

<!-- /SYNC:project-protocol-overlay -->

<!-- SYNC:project-protocol-overlay:reminder -->

**MUST ATTENTION** resolve this skill's overlays from the index at `<docsRoots.projectReference.path>/skill-protocols-reference.md` (default `docs/project-reference/`; overridable in `docs/project-config.json`); an empty task `referenceDocs` does NOT disable this lookup. Read ONLY matched bodies from the directory the index header names (default `docs/project-protocols/`). Specificity (exact > glob > `*`) ranks overlays against EACH OTHER, never against the skill. Missing/malformed body → report and skip; no index or no match → proceed silently. Overlays are ADDITIVE ONLY — never an authority escalation or a gate waiver; equal-tier contradiction goes to the user.

- **MANDATORY** Project config is OPTIONAL (default `docs/project-config.json`, via its loader): absent → portable defaults plus repository evidence, state material assumptions, never block; present → non-empty `project.name`, neutral defaults for omitted capabilities, fail closed on a declared malformed section.
- **MANDATORY** An explicit `referenceDocs` array is exact, including `[]`; absent → only the capability-aware resolver output, which may be empty. `lessons.md` and docs-index are always-on, outside that selection. A missing/stale required input or malformed declared section → `/project-init` or the narrow owner route before relying on it.
- **MANDATORY** Pick docs by the phase you are about to enter — plan/investigate, edit code, tests, specs/docs, review — from the gate's routing table, JUST IN TIME before the first target read/grep/edit/test, plus the file's `contextGroups[]` conventions before editing it; cite `Reference docs read: ...`.
- **MANDATORY** Dedup: skip a re-read only for your own full read after the last compaction, within ~200K tokens, unchanged since — a hook reminder, summary, or prior mention is NEVER evidence; re-read after compaction or resume, and give delegated sub-agents the resolved doc paths. Project config and conventions override generic framework defaults.

## Closing Reminders

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION — Protocols in force (concise digest of the SYNC/shared blocks this skill carries):**

- **Source/Test Drift:** on source change, evidence-decide whether tests update or source is a bug.
- **AI Mistake Prevention:** verify generated content against evidence, trace downstream references, verify all affected outputs, re-read after context loss, surface ambiguity.
- **Evidence:** cite `file:line` for every claim; confidence >80% to act, <60% don't recommend.
- **Critical Thinking:** apply critical + sequential thinking; never present a guess as fact.

- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** break work into small todo tasks using `TaskCreate` BEFORE starting
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** search codebase for 3+ similar patterns before creating new code
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** cite `file:line` evidence for every claim (confidence >80% to act)
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** add a final review todo task to verify work quality
  **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** READ the following files before starting:

**[TASK-PLANNING]** Before acting, analyze task scope and systematically break it into small todo tasks and sub-tasks using TaskCreate.
