## Quick Summary

**Goal:** [Code Intelligence] Trace full system flow from a target file or function through all edge types (CALLS, events, bus messages, API endpoints). Supports downstream, upstream, or bidirectional tracing. Use when investigating what happens when code executes, understanding blast radius, or tracing frontend-to-backend flows.

**Workflow:**

1. **Detect** — classify request scope and target artifacts.
2. **Execute** — apply required steps with evidence-backed actions.
3. **Verify** — confirm constraints, output quality, and completion evidence.

**Key Rules:**

- MUST ATTENTION keep claims evidence-based (`file:line`) with confidence >80% to act.
- MUST ATTENTION keep task tracking updated as each step starts/completes.
- NEVER skip mandatory workflow or skill gates.

## When to Use

- **"What happens when X is called/created/updated?"** → `--direction downstream`
- **"What calls/triggers X?"** → `--direction upstream`
- **"Show me the full flow through X"** → `--direction both` (best when entry point is a middle file like a controller or command handler)
- **Impact analysis** — understand what's affected by a code change
- **Cross-service tracing** — follow MESSAGE_BUS edges to see which services consume events

## Prerequisites

Graph must exist (`.code-graph/graph.db`). If missing, run `/graph-build` first.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Identify the target

If the user specifies a file path, use it directly. If the query is semantic:

1. **For bug/failure symptoms:** grep for the observed final output first (reader, renderer, assertion, query, aggregate, log, stored field), then use that file as the first trace target.
2. **For feature-flow questions:** grep for entry point files related to the user's query.
3. Use the discovered file as the trace target.

### Step 2: Choose direction

| Direction              | When to Use                         | Example                                   |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `downstream` (default) | What does this code trigger?        | "What happens after an order is created?" |
| `upstream`             | What calls this code?               | "What triggers this event handler?"       |
| `both`                 | Full picture through a middle point | "Show full flow through this controller"  |

**Bug/failure rule:** start with `upstream` or `both` from the final reader/output file before tracing producers downstream. This prevents starting from a guessed origin path and missing alternate writers.

### Step 3: Run trace

```bash
# Downstream trace (default) — what does this trigger?
python .claude/scripts/code_graph trace <target> --json

# Upstream trace — what calls/triggers this?
python .claude/scripts/code_graph trace <target> --direction upstream --json

# Bidirectional — full flow through this point
python .claude/scripts/code_graph trace <target> --direction both --json

# End-to-start bug trace — begin at final reader/output, then enumerate upstream producers
python .claude/scripts/code_graph trace <final-reader-or-output-file> --direction upstream --depth 5 --json
python .claude/scripts/code_graph trace <writer-or-consumer-file> --direction both --depth 5 --json

# Custom depth (default: 3)
python .claude/scripts/code_graph trace <target> --direction both --depth 5 --json

# Filter to specific edge types
python .claude/scripts/code_graph trace <target> --edge-kinds CALLS,MESSAGE_BUS --json
```

### Step 4: Present results

The trace returns a multi-level BFS tree:

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "direction": "both",
  "levels": [
    { "depth": 0, "nodes": [...], "edges": [] },
    { "depth": 1, "nodes": [...], "edges": [{ "kind": "CALLS", ... }] },
    { "depth": 2, "nodes": [...], "edges": [{ "kind": "MESSAGE_BUS", ... }] }
  ]
}
```

Present results grouped by depth level. Highlight cross-service MESSAGE_BUS edges — these show the flow spreading to other microservices.

### Step 5: Handle ambiguous targets

If trace returns `status: "ambiguous"`, multiple nodes match the target name. Use `search` to find the exact qualified name:

```bash
python .claude/scripts/code_graph search <keyword> --kind Function --json
```

Then retry with the full qualified name.

## Post-Grep Trace Trigger (run a trace after grep surfaces a key file)

When a grep/glob surfaces an important entry-point file — an entity, command, query, event/command handler, controller, bus message/consumer, component, store, or api-service — immediately run a graph trace on it before concluding. Grep finds files; the trace reveals callers, consumers, bus messages, event chains, and tests that grep CANNOT find:

```bash
python .claude/scripts/code_graph trace <key-entry-file> --direction both --json
```

**Pattern: grep finds files → graph trace reveals full system flow → grep verifies specific details.**

## Edge Types Traced

| Edge Kind                | Meaning                                          |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `CALLS`                  | Direct function/method calls                     |
| `TRIGGERS_EVENT`         | Entity CRUD triggers event handler               |
| `PRODUCES_EVENT`         | Event handler triggers bus message producer      |
| `MESSAGE_BUS`            | Bus message producer to consumer (cross-service) |
| `TRIGGERS_COMMAND_EVENT` | Command triggers command event handler           |
| `API_ENDPOINT`           | Frontend HTTP call to backend route              |

## CLI Reference

```
trace <target> [--direction downstream|upstream|both] [--depth N] [--edge-kinds KIND1,KIND2] [--node-mode file|function|class|all] [--json]
```

| Flag           | Default      | Description                                                         |
| -------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--direction`  | `downstream` | Trace direction                                                     |
| `--depth`      | `3`          | Maximum BFS depth                                                   |
| `--edge-kinds` | all          | Comma-separated edge kinds to follow                                |
| `--node-mode`  | `all`        | Granularity: `file` (10-30x less noise), `function`, `class`, `all` |
| `--json`       | off          | Structured JSON output                                              |

## Examples

```bash
# What happens when a user is created? (trace from command handler downstream — substitute paths from project config)
python .claude/scripts/code_graph trace {path/to/command-handler-file} --json

# What calls this API controller? (trace upstream to find frontend callers)
python .claude/scripts/code_graph trace {path/to/controller-file} --direction upstream --json

# Full flow through an entity event handler (upstream triggers + downstream consumers)
python .claude/scripts/code_graph trace {path/to/event-handler-file} --direction both --json

# File-level overview (10-30x less noise — great first pass before drilling into functions)
python .claude/scripts/code_graph trace {path/to/controller-file} --direction both --node-mode file --json
```

## Anti-Patterns

- **Don't trace without `--json`** — structured output is needed for parsing
- **Don't trace with depth > 5** — results get noisy; use edge-kinds filter instead
- **Don't skip grep-first** — if you don't know the file path, grep for it first
- **Don't use for single-hop queries** — use `callers_of` or `importers_of` instead (faster)

# Graph Trace — Full System Flow

Trace connections from a target node through multiple edge types using BFS. Shows the complete chain: API endpoints → commands → entity events → bus messages → cross-service consumers.

<!-- PROTOCOL-GUIDES:END -->

<!-- SYNC:critical-thinking-mindset:reminder -->

**MUST ATTENTION** critical + sequential thinking: every claim carries traced evidence (`file:line` for code, source URL or artifact section otherwise); confidence >80% to act, <60% do NOT recommend. Never present a guess as fact; admit uncertainty and stay skeptical of your own confidence.

<!-- /SYNC:critical-thinking-mindset:reminder -->

<!-- SYNC:ai-mistake-prevention:reminder -->

**MUST ATTENTION** Check project config, relevant references, and local evidence before applying stack-specific conventions; honor explicit N/A. ROOT-CAUSE GATE: before any project-related correction, use the appropriate root-cause investigation protocol; failed/unstable tests require the test-investigation protocol before editing source/tests — never force green.

<!-- /SYNC:ai-mistake-prevention:reminder -->

<!-- SYNC:end-to-start-debugger-trace:reminder -->

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** debugger trace gate: for non-trivial bug/fix/investigation/review work, start at the observed final output and trace backward through reader -> storage/projection -> writer -> consumer/job -> producer/trigger. Enumerate all feeder paths and hypotheses before fixing; select the authoritative invariant owner from project architecture and retain validation at untrusted boundaries. **BLOCKED until** trace, hypothesis matrix, owning fix layer, and forward convergence proof exist.

<!-- /SYNC:end-to-start-debugger-trace:reminder -->

<!-- SYNC:project-protocol-overlay:reminder -->

**MUST ATTENTION** resolve this skill's overlays from the index at `<docsRoots.projectReference.path>/skill-protocols-reference.md` (default `docs/project-reference/`; overridable in `docs/project-config.json`); an empty task `referenceDocs` does NOT disable this lookup. Read ONLY matched bodies from the directory the index header names (default `docs/project-protocols/`). Specificity (exact > glob > `*`) ranks overlays against EACH OTHER, never against the skill. Missing/malformed body → report and skip; no index or no match → proceed silently. Overlays are ADDITIVE ONLY — never an authority escalation or a gate waiver; equal-tier contradiction goes to the user.

<!-- /SYNC:project-protocol-overlay:reminder -->

## Closing Reminders

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION — Protocols in force (concise digest of the SYNC/shared blocks this skill carries):**

- **End-to-Start Debugger Trace:** trace backward from final output, enumerate feeders before fixing.
- **AI Mistake Prevention:** verify generated content against evidence, trace downstream references, verify all affected outputs, re-read after context loss, surface ambiguity.
- **Critical Thinking:** trace every claim, confidence >80% to act, never guess.

- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** break work into small todo tasks using `TaskCreate` BEFORE starting
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** search codebase for 3+ similar patterns before creating new code
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** cite `file:line` evidence for every claim (confidence >80% to act)
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** add a final review todo task to verify work quality

**[TASK-PLANNING]** Before acting, analyze task scope and systematically break it into small todo tasks and sub-tasks using TaskCreate.
