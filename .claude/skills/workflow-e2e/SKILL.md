## Quick Summary

**Goal:** [Workflow] Trigger the E2E testing workflow — one parameterized entry covering change, recording, UI, prompt/context, and whole-project verification. `--source` selects the protocol; prompt/context/whole verification hands off to the bounded green loop.

**Summary:** Resolve `--source={changes|recording|update-ui|prompt|context|whole}` (infer and state it when omitted). Existing source modes run the established sequence; prompt/context/whole invoke the config-first `/workflow-e2e-green` loop, which selects or generates scenarios, exercises visible web journeys, adjudicates failures, and repeats bounded remediation with evidence.
- **Testability contract:** resolve Unit/Integration/System/E2E applicability from runner/config evidence; record owner/root/data, copy-ready full + focused commands, zero-match behavior, CI/simple-Windows entry, unique run/data identity, and repeat proof; unresolved applicable fields block handoff, while non-applicable tiers require evidence-backed `N/A`.

**Workflow:**

1. **Detect** — read `--source={changes|recording|update-ui|prompt|context|whole}`; classify request scope and target artifacts.
2. **Execute** — apply the source-specific protocol below with evidence-backed actions.
3. **Verify** — confirm constraints, output quality, and completion evidence.

**Key Rules:**

- MUST ATTENTION keep claims evidence-based (`file:line`) with confidence >80% to act.
- MUST ATTENTION keep task tracking updated as each step starts/completes.
- MUST ATTENTION define success criteria before execution and loop until observable verification passes.
- MUST ATTENTION when creating/reviewing specs or tests, name `Business Intent / Invariant Guarded` or the protected business intent/invariant and ensure the test would fail if that intent breaks.
- NEVER skip mandatory workflow or skill gates.

**IMPORTANT MANDATORY Steps:** /investigate -> /e2e-test -> /experience-review -> /test -> /docs-update -> /workflow-end -> /watzup

**Green source handoff Steps:** /investigate -> /e2e-test-verify-loop -> /docs-update -> /workflow-end -> /watzup.

> **[BLOCKING]** Each step MUST ATTENTION invoke its `Skill` tool — marking a task `completed` without skill invocation is a workflow violation. NEVER batch-complete validation gates.

## Source Dispatch (`--source`)

Resolve `--source` from the invocation. If omitted, infer from the request (recording file present → `recording`; UI/SCSS/HTML diff → `update-ui`; otherwise `changes`) and state the chosen source before proceeding.

| `--source`  | Use when                                                                 | When NOT to use                                                        |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `changes`   | Test specs or source code changed and E2E tests need to be synced.       | New recordings (`recording`), visual-only changes (`update-ui`).       |
| `recording` | A Chrome DevTools recording JSON exists and a Playwright test is wanted. | Updating existing tests, writing from scratch, running existing tests. |
| `update-ui` | UI changed and E2E screenshot baselines need updating.                   | Generating new tests, fixing test logic, non-visual changes.           |
| `prompt`    | The user gives a feature, bugfix, journey, or QC request and the suitable E2E test may need to be selected or generated. | A narrowly scoped existing-test maintenance task. |
| `context`   | Current project/spec/code context should determine the E2E scope and cases. | A single known recording or baseline update. |
| `whole`     | The user asks for a project-wide E2E/QC verification run. | A feature-local change that does not require the full configured suite. |

The `changes`, `recording`, and `update-ui` sources run the established sequence: `/investigate → /e2e-test → /experience-review (conditional) → /test → /docs-update → /workflow-end → /watzup`. The downstream `e2e-test` leaf is mode-aware and performs the per-source work; `experience-review` classifies and inspects relevant observable evidence before any expectation promotion.

The `prompt`, `context`, and `whole` sources use `/workflow-e2e-green`: `/investigate` resolves project configuration and applicability, `/e2e-test-verify-loop` selects or generates Given/When/Then cases, exercises the configured lifecycle in a visible browser where applicable, evaluates human-QC evidence, and performs bounded debug/fix/retest rounds. `/docs-update`, `/workflow-end`, and `/watzup` remain mandatory after the loop.

### `--source=changes` — E2E from Changes

```
E2E FROM CHANGES PROTOCOL:
1. Detect change type from git diff:
   - Test spec changes in feature docs -> Generate new test cases
   - Code changes -> Update existing test assertions
   - API changes -> Update test data and API mocks
2. Load affected test specifications (TC-{FEATURE}-{NNN})
3. Update or generate test implementations
4. Ensure traceability: each TC has corresponding test
5. Run tests to verify changes work
6. Report updated test coverage
```

### `--source=recording` — E2E from Recording

```
E2E FROM RECORDING PROTOCOL:
1. Validate recording file exists (JSON format)
2. Identify target app and feature from user context
3. Run convert-recording.ts to generate initial test file
4. Load test specifications from feature docs Section 8
5. Map TC-{FEATURE}-{NNN} test cases to recording steps
6. Enhance generated code with project CSS conventions (from docs/project-config.json → workflowPatterns.cssMethodology)
7. Add screenshot assertions at key states
8. Generate Page Object if complex flow
9. Run test to verify it passes
10. Report generated files and any manual steps needed
```

### `--source=update-ui` — E2E Update UI

```
E2E UPDATE UI PROTOCOL:
1. Identify visual changes from git diff (SCSS, HTML, TS)
2. Map changed files to affected page objects
3. Find E2E specs using those page objects
4. Run affected tests to collect candidate screenshots/evidence without changing accepted expectations
5. Run /experience-review to exercise the intended journey, open and inspect the candidate evidence, and classify observed/judged/acceptance state
6. Update only the affected snapshots/baselines after an explicit acceptance record; otherwise preserve the previous accepted expectation and report ACCEPTANCE-PENDING, ENVIRONMENT-BLOCKED, or the applicable mismatch decision
7. Report updated files, evidence references, decision, and any remaining limitation
```

### `--source=prompt|context|whole` — E2E Verify Green Handoff

```
E2E VERIFY GREEN PROTOCOL:
1. Resolve the requested scope from the prompt, current context, feature/bugfix, or whole configured project.
2. Read docs/project-config.json and the linked E2E reference before choosing a runner, startup command, port, account, seed, selector, or evidence path.
3. If the E2E profile is absent or incomplete, perform bounded repository discovery; record N/A only when E2E is not applicable and ENVIRONMENT-BLOCKED when an applicable prerequisite cannot be verified.
4. Select suitable existing cases or generate cases from the governing spec and code intent. Record Given/When/Then, protected invariant, and settle condition for every case.
5. Exercise the configured project lifecycle. For web journeys use a visible Playwright CLI browser when the project supports it; use readiness/actionability waits for correctness and 200–300ms delays only after completed actions for human-QC presentation.
6. Capture, open, assess, and redact the configured evidence (screenshots, console/page errors, requests, trace, or video) as needed.
7. Run bounded fresh rounds. Classify each failure before changing source or test, fix at the owning layer, review each fix, and re-run the same scope until the configured convergence contract is met or escalate with exact evidence.
```

**UNIVERSAL RULES (all sources):**

- Goal-Driven Execution: define success criteria before execution; loop until observable checks pass.
- Tests Verify Intent: when creating or reviewing specs/tests, name the protected business intent or invariant and ensure the test would fail if that intent breaks.

Activate the `workflow-e2e` workflow for `changes`, `recording`, and `update-ui`. For `prompt`, `context`, or `whole`, run `/start-workflow workflow-e2e-green` with the user's prompt/current context and the resolved scope protocol above.

**Steps:** Existing source modes: `/investigate → /e2e-test → /experience-review → /test → /docs-update → /workflow-end → /watzup`. Green sources: `/investigate → /e2e-test-verify-loop` (nested `/experience-review` report-only) → `/docs-update → /workflow-end → /watzup`.

## Experience Acceptance Handoff

When the E2E source touches a configured or likely observable surface, carry the `experience-review` record through the workflow:

- Exercise the actual configured entry point and inspect the resulting screenshot, transcript, response, or artifact; generated evidence that was not opened and assessed is not verification.
- A first run creates candidate evidence only. Do not pass `--update-snapshots`, rewrite fixtures, or replace an expectation until the record has an explicit named acceptance decision.
- On mismatch, preserve the prior accepted expectation and classify the result before choosing source fix, test fix, intended-change acceptance, invalid condition, environment block, or escalation.
- `/experience-review` runs a BOUNDED remediation loop (`--rounds=N`, default 3): each round adjudicates the BLOCKING defects, fixes at the owning layer via `/fix`, `/changes-review`s that round's fix diff, and re-exercises from scratch. Only objectively-checkable defects open a round — ADVISORY/taste findings are recorded, never looped on. Pass `--rounds=0` when this workflow must audit without changing the product. Cap reached, count not shrinking, count rising, or `ENVIRONMENT-BLOCKED` → `NOT-CONVERGED` + escalation, never a partial pass.
- A skipped occurrence needs an evidence-backed `NOT-APPLICABLE` reason; a relevant but unavailable runner/device/inspection capability is `ENVIRONMENT-BLOCKED`, never a green result.

## Test Architecture Contract Handoff

Before `/e2e-test`, resolve and carry one evidence-backed contract record through the existing sequence:

| Field | Required handoff |
| --- | --- |
| `applicability` | Mark E2E `APPLICABLE` only with evidence of a configured framework, runner, and command; otherwise record `N/A — <evidence>`. Skill-local browser helpers are not project evidence. |
| `owner` | Name the delegated owner for setup, E2E implementation, execution evidence, and documentation; do not duplicate leaf responsibilities. |
| `fullCommand` / `focusedCommand` | Provide copy-ready configured commands for the full suite and focused/partial scope; invalid or zero-match selections must exit non-zero, with a simple/Windows entry point when required. |
| `runIdentity` / `dataStrategy` | Provide a unique non-sensitive run identity and business-data suffix, valid public-path setup, declared seed/accumulation mode, and parallel-worker isolation. |
| `repeatProof` / `result` | Carry exact counts, failing names, and exit status, plus repeat/parallel evidence and two consecutive no-reset full runs for each applicable persistent-state suite. |

`/investigate` resolves applicability and scope; `/e2e-test` owns E2E setup and configured commands; `/test` receives the command/scope/data record and reports exact results read-only; `/docs-update` receives the final evidence. If E2E is not configured, `/e2e-test` records the evidence-backed `N/A` and does not substitute an invented runner; the delegated order and explicit acceptance gate remain unchanged.

> **AI Mistake Prevention** — Failure modes to avoid on every task:
>
> **Re-read files after context changes.** Context compaction, resume, or long-running work can make memory stale; verify current files before acting.
> **Verify generated content against source evidence.** AI hallucinates APIs, names, claims, and document facts. Check the relevant source before documenting or referencing.
> **Check downstream references before deleting or renaming.** Removing an artifact can stale docs, generated mirrors, configs, and callers; map references first.
> **Trace the full impact chain after edits.** Changing a definition can miss derived outputs and consumers. Follow the affected chain before declaring done.
> **Verify ALL affected outputs, not just the first.** One green check is not all green checks; validate every output surface the change can affect.
> **Assume existing values are intentional — ask WHY before changing OR flagging one as a defect.** Before changing or reporting a constant, limit, flag, cutoff, wording, or pattern, read nearby context and history, the CALLER's ordering, and 2+ sibling call sites of the same convention. A doc stating WHAT without WHY is missing rationale, not proof of a missing guard.
> **Surface ambiguity before acting — don't pick silently.** Multiple valid interpretations require an explicit question or stated assumption with risk.
> **Assert the outcome your system owns, not the intermediate state your infrastructure owns.** When verifying async work, assert the final business state — never the delivery/retry bookkeeping held in shared infrastructure that any co-running process can write. Such a check passes when run alone and flakes the moment anything else shares that infrastructure.
> **Keep shared guidance role-relevant.** Universal guidance must help every receiving skill or agent; code-specific obligations belong only in code-specific protocols.

<!-- SYNC:nested-task-creation -->

> **Nested Task Expansion Contract** — For workflow-step invocation, the `[Workflow] ...` row is only a parent container; the child skill still creates visible phase tasks.
>
> 1. Call `TaskList` first. If a matching active parent workflow row exists, set `nested=true` and record `parentTaskId`; otherwise run standalone.
> 2. Create one task per declared phase before phase work. When nested, prefix subjects `[N.M] /skill-name — phase`.
> 3. When nested, link the parent with `TaskUpdate(parentTaskId, addBlockedBy: [childIds])`.
> 4. Orchestrators must pre-expand a child skill's phase list and link the workflow row before invoking that child skill or sub-agent.
> 5. Mark exactly one child `in_progress` before work and `completed` immediately after evidence is written.
> 6. Complete the parent only after all child tasks are completed or explicitly cancelled with reason.
>
> **Blocked until:** `TaskList` done, child phases created, parent linked when nested, first child marked `in_progress`.

> 2. **After each file/section reviewed:** Append findings, evidence, changed paths, and gaps immediately — never hold them in memory.
> 3. **Delegated return:** A sub-agent emits only the structured `SYNC:subagent-return-contract` envelope with exact totals, salient Critical/High findings (maximum ten), current attempt, and `Full report:` path. **Inline user-facing output:** Preserve the skill's requested explanation or teaching, with links to the persisted evidence; the delegated transport limit does not replace that deliverable. Do not paste a full review report into an envelope.
> 4. **Parent synthesis:** The main agent reads the full report for synthesis, acceptance, deduplication, and repair planning — not only when a named blocker exists. It preserves all severities beyond the transport cap.
> 5. **Read-only boundary:** A read-only leaf may write its report/repair proposal but MUST NOT edit source, generated output, or user data; the parent/owner performs repairs after acceptance.
> 6. **Advancement gate:** The parent records `ACCEPTED` for the current Attempt ID only after reconciling target, totals, gaps, and changed paths; stale or late attempts cannot advance dependent work.
>
> **Why:** Context cutoff mid-execution loses ALL in-memory findings. Each disk write survives compaction. Partial results are better than no results, while explicit identity prevents a late result from being mistaken for the current run.

<!-- /SYNC:subagent-return-contract -->

<!-- SYNC:test-architecture-execution-contract -->

> **Test Architecture & Execution Contract** — Treat testability as a setup/architecture acceptance condition. For every potentially applicable tier — Unit, Integration/System, E2E, and Performance/Scale (warranted at `T1+`/`B2+`) — record `APPLICABLE` only with evidence of its runner/framework/configuration; otherwise record `N/A — <evidence>` and never fabricate coverage.
>
> 1. **Matrix before implementation:** Record applicability, owner, runner/framework, test root, fixture/data strategy, full command, focused/partial command, zero-match behavior, CI gate, a simple/Windows entry point (a `.cmd` when the project needs one), the **host-mode AND container-mode commands** where the project supports both, and the **environment reach** (which of local / CI / production-shaped this tier can target).
> 1a. **E2E profile handoff:** For E2E, also record the selected `surfaceIds[]`, the linked `localRun` owner, auth mode/reference, seed/data mode, browser runner/engine/headed setting, action-delay policy, evidence root/capture/redaction policy, and convergence cap. Missing fields remain explicit blockers or N/A; they are never filled from generic browser defaults.
> 2. **Runnable scopes:** Full and focused commands must be copy-ready, fail on invalid or zero-match selections, report exact counts and exit status, and be safe to repeat. E2E uses only configured browser/service commands. A visible human-QC web run waits on readiness/actionability first and may add a deterministic 200–300ms post-action delay for presentation; the delay is never a readiness mechanism.
> 3. **Fresh valid state:** Each run/test owns a unique run identity and business-data suffix, arranges through supported public paths, and uses realistic valid data. Reference setup is count-before-create, idempotent, and restart-safe. Intentional accumulation is additive, keyed, and integrity-checked; never hide contamination with destructive reset.
>    Run-scoped cleanup, when supported, is opt-in and idempotent: after evidence capture it may remove only ephemeral resources owned by the current run; it must never delete persistent/additive data or another run's data, reset shared state, or replace no-reset proof.
> 4. **Isolation and fidelity:** Isolate mutable roots and parallel workers; share only immutable/reference data. Preserve real actor pacing and observable arrange barriers. Do not widen retries or weaken assertions to make a scenario pass.
> 5. **Evidence gate:** Report command, scope, identity, seed/accumulation mode, exact result, and repeat proof. For each applicable persistent-state suite, require two consecutive no-reset full runs. Treat line coverage as diagnostic only; use meaningful property/invariant, mutation, change, and behavior coverage signals.
> 6. **Execution modes and environment reach:** A tier claiming two run modes must have **BOTH exercised** — the bare-host command and the fully-containerized command, driven from ONE source of truth for config and topology; record which mode CI exercises, because an unexercised mode rots silently and a claimed-but-rotten mode is worse than one never claimed. The SAME suite must reach local, CI and (where warranted) a production-shaped target, **parameterized by configuration, never by forked test code** — only one fork ever stays maintained, so forking guarantees divergence. A target lacking a required capability reports `ENVIRONMENT-BLOCKED`, never a silent pass. Tests unsafe against production are excluded by an **ENFORCED** mechanism whose absence fails loudly, not by a convention someone must remember; *"runs in prod"* means a safe, declared, **NON-MUTATING** subset. Reproducibility underwrites all of it — pinned toolchain, locked dependencies, declared external prerequisites — which is the difference between a suite that passes anywhere and one that passes on its author's machine. Depth → `SYNC:engineering-foundation-gate` **F1/F2/F3**.
>
> **Ownership:** Architecture/harness defines the matrix; scaffold/workflow makes it runnable; test writers implement tier-specific cases; reviewers verify the contract; the runner reports; seed-data owners preserve uniqueness, idempotency, realism, and accumulation integrity. Missing required evidence blocks setup completion.

> **Project Protocol Overlay** — Before executing this skill, resolve any PROJECT overlay rules layered onto it: match this skill's name against the `Target` column of the project's skill-protocol index (`docs/project-reference/skill-protocols-reference.md` by default; a `referenceDocs` entry in `docs/project-config.json` overrides the path), taking the most specific matching tier ONLY — exact name > glob > `*`. **That precedence orders overlays against EACH OTHER, never against this skill.** Read ONLY the matched bodies, resolved as `<protocols-dir>/<Name>.md`; a row's Body link is display text, never a read path. A matched body that is missing or malformed is REPORTED and skipped — never reconstructed from the index Description. No index, or no match -> proceed with no overlay, silently.

>
> Overlays are **ADDITIVE ONLY**: they ADD rules on top of this skill's own protocol and NEVER replace, override, disable, or reinterpret a rule it already states — removing every overlay must return this skill to exactly its documented behavior. An overlay is a BRIEF, not an authority escalation: it can NEVER waive a workflow gate, git discipline, a review gate, or a user-confirmation gate.

## Closing Reminders

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** Testability contract: resolve evidence-backed Unit/Integration/System/E2E rows, copy-ready full/focused commands, zero-match failures, owner/root/data, CI/simple-Windows entry, unique run identity, and repeat proof before claiming setup, review, or test completion.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION Goal:** [Workflow] Trigger the E2E testing workflow — one parameterized entry covering maintenance and green verification source modes. `--source` selects the protocol; every source conditionally reviews relevant observable experience before expectation promotion and regression verification.

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION Workflow:** Resolve and state `--source={changes|recording|update-ui|prompt|context|whole}`; apply the established source protocol or the config-first green loop through its declared sequence; preserve intent-named test assertions, evidence-backed task transitions, visible human-QC evidence, and explicit verification of generated/updated E2E artifacts.

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION — Protocols in force (concise digest of the SYNC/shared blocks this skill carries):**

- **AI Mistake Prevention:** verify generated content against evidence, trace downstream references, verify all affected outputs, re-read after context loss, surface ambiguity.
- **Nested Task Creation:** expand child phases, link parent when nested.
- **Critical Thinking:** traced `file:line` proof, confidence >80% to act.
- **Incremental Persistence:** append findings to report file after each section.
- **Subagent Return Contract:** sub-agent returns summary-only with `Full report:` pointer.

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** break work into small todo tasks using `TaskCreate` BEFORE starting
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** search codebase for 3+ similar patterns before creating new code
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** cite `file:line` evidence for every claim (confidence >80% to act)
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** add a final review todo task to verify work quality

**[TASK-PLANNING]** Before acting, analyze task scope and systematically break it into small todo tasks and sub-tasks using TaskCreate.

> **[IMPORTANT]** Analyze how big the task is and break it into many small todo tasks systematically before starting — this is very important.
