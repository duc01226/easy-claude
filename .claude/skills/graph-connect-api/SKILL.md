version: 2.0.0

## Quick Summary

**Goal:** [Code Intelligence] Detect frontend-to-backend API connections using the knowledge graph. Matches configured frontend HTTP-call patterns with configured backend route patterns via project-config.json configuration.

**Workflow:**

1. **Detect** — classify request scope and target artifacts.
2. **Execute** — apply required steps with evidence-backed actions.
3. **Verify** — confirm constraints, output quality, and completion evidence.

**Key Rules:**

- MUST ATTENTION keep claims evidence-based (`file:line`) with confidence >80% to act.
- MUST ATTENTION keep task tracking updated as each step starts/completes.
- NEVER skip mandatory workflow or skill gates.

## How It Works

The connector scans frontend files for HTTP calls and backend files for route definitions, normalizes URL paths, and matches them using a multi-strategy algorithm:

1. **Exact match** — normalized paths identical
2. **Prefix-augmented** — prepends `routePrefix` to frontend path
3. **Suffix match** — strips `routePrefix` from backend, matches remainder
4. **Deep strip** — strips leading `{param}` segments from backend (handles class-level `{companyId}` routes)
5. **Controller resolution** — resolves configured route placeholders to actual route owner names

## Zero-Config Auto-Detection

**No configuration needed.** The connector auto-detects frameworks by scanning for marker files:

| Frontend | Markers                                                    |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Configured frontend framework | framework manifests and package metadata from project config |
| React    | `react` in package.json                                    |
| Vue      | `vue.config.js`, `vue` in package.json                     |
| Next.js  | `next.config.js`, `next` in package.json                   |
| Svelte   | `svelte.config.js`, `svelte` in package.json               |

| Backend | Markers                                     |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Configured backend framework | backend manifests and route metadata from project config |
| Spring  | `pom.xml`/`build.gradle` with `spring-boot` |
| Express | `express` in package.json                   |
| NestJS  | `@nestjs/core` in package.json              |
| FastAPI | `fastapi` in requirements.txt               |
| Django  | `manage.py` with django                     |
| Rails   | `Gemfile` with `rails`                      |
| Go      | `go.mod` (Gin/Echo patterns)                |

## Auto-Run Behavior

The connector runs **automatically** in these situations:

| When                                    | Behavior                                                     |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| After `build` / `update` / `sync`       | Always runs via `_auto_connect()`                            |
| First `trace` / `query` / `connections` | Runs once via `_ensure_connectors_ran()` if never run before |

**You almost never need to run this manually.** The graph CLI handles it automatically.

## Custom Config (Optional)

For projects with custom HTTP patterns (e.g., base class API service), add to `docs/project-config.json`:

```json
{
    "graphConnectors": {
        "apiEndpoints": {
            "enabled": true,
            "frontend": {
                "framework": "{configured-frontend-framework}",
                "paths": ["{frontend-source-root}/"],
                "customPatterns": ["this\\.\\s*(get|post|put|delete|patch)\\s*[<(]\\s*['\"]([^\"']+)"]
            },
            "backend": {
                "framework": "dotnet",
                "paths": ["{api-source-root}/"],
                "routePrefix": "api",
                "customPatterns": []
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Custom patterns **extend** (not replace) built-in framework patterns. Explicit config **overrides** auto-detected config for paths.

## Manual Run

```bash
python .claude/scripts/code_graph connect-api --json
```

## Steps (when manually invoked)

1. **Run connector** via Bash:
    ```bash
    python .claude/scripts/code_graph connect-api --json
    ```
2. **Report results:** Frontend calls found, backend routes found, matches created, edge count

## Matching Strategies

The connector tries 5 strategies in order (highest confidence first):

| #   | Strategy         | Confidence | Example                                           |
| --- | ---------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Exact match      | 1.0        | FE `/api/users` = BE `/api/users`                 |
| 2   | Prefix-augmented | 0.95       | FE `/users` + prefix `api` → `/api/users`         |
| 3   | Suffix match     | 0.9        | BE `/api/users` stripped → `/users` = FE `/users` |
| 4   | Deep strip       | 0.85       | BE `/api/{param}/users` → `/users` = FE `/users`  |
| 5   | Deep strip both  | 0.8        | Both sides have `{param}` segments stripped       |

> **AI Mistake Prevention** — Failure modes to avoid on every task:
>
> **Project applicability gate.** Before applying a stack, layer, style, tool, or architecture rule, read the project's config and relevant references, then check local implementations. Treat framework examples as examples; honor explicit N/A and do not require a technology or convention the project does not use.
> **ROOT-CAUSE GATE — INVESTIGATE FIRST.** Before applying any project-related correction, always use the project's root-cause investigation protocol and establish the cause; the failure site may be only a symptom.
> **FAILED-TEST GATE.** For any failed or unstable test, use the project's test-investigation protocol before editing source or tests; never change either side merely to force green.
> **Re-read files after context changes.** Context compaction, resume, or long-running work can make memory stale; verify current files before acting.
> **Verify generated content against source evidence.** AI hallucinates APIs, names, claims, and document facts. Check the relevant source before documenting or referencing.
> **Check downstream references before deleting or renaming.** Removing an artifact can stale docs, generated mirrors, configs, and callers; map references first.
> **Trace the full impact chain after edits.** Changing a definition can miss derived outputs and consumers. Follow the affected chain before declaring done.
> **Verify ALL affected outputs, not just the first.** One green check is not all green checks; validate every output surface the change can affect.
> **Assume existing values are intentional — ask WHY before changing OR flagging one as a defect.** Before changing or reporting a constant, limit, flag, cutoff, wording, or pattern, read nearby context and history, the CALLER's ordering, and 2+ sibling call sites of the same convention. A doc stating WHAT without WHY is missing rationale, not proof of a missing guard.
> **Surface ambiguity before acting — don't pick silently.** Multiple valid interpretations require an explicit question or stated assumption with risk.
> **Assert the outcome your system owns, not the intermediate state your infrastructure owns.** When verifying async work, assert the final business state — never the delivery/retry bookkeeping held in shared infrastructure that any co-running process can write. Such a check passes when run alone and flakes the moment anything else shares that infrastructure.
> **Store disposable generated output in the project workspace.** If an output can be regenerated and is not source code, a canonical source-of-truth, or an intentionally versioned projection, write it under the project-root `tmp/` or `temp/` directory (prefer `tmp/`), scoped to the run. This includes temporary state, integration/E2E results, reports, logs, screenshots, traces, videos, coverage, dumps, and candidate evidence. Never put these outputs in source, docs, the plans root (default `plans/`; a `docsRoots.plans.path` entry in `docs/project-config.json` overrides the path), the team-artifacts root (default `team-artifacts/`; `docsRoots.teamArtifacts.path` in the same config overrides the path), or mirror directories; the project-root `.gitignore` must ignore `/tmp/` and `/temp/` by default. Committed fixtures, accepted baselines, canonical specs/docs, and explicitly versioned generated mirrors remain at their declared owner paths.
> **Judge the environment before judging the code.** A bug report, failed test, error, or unexpected output is not proof of a code defect. Before and during adjudication, weigh environment causes as a competing hypothesis — setup, config, version and dependency state, service dependencies, stale artifacts or leftover state, and transient resource pressure (RAM, CPU, disk, handles, network). State the discriminator you ran; fix an environment cause in the environment, never by editing product code or weakening a test to absorb it.
> **Keep shared guidance role-relevant.** Universal guidance must help every receiving skill or agent; code-specific obligations belong only in code-specific protocols.

> **Critical Thinking Mindset** — Apply critical thinking, sequential thinking. Every claim needs traced proof, confidence >80% to act.
> **Anti-hallucination:** Never present guess as fact — cite sources for every claim, admit uncertainty freely, self-check output for errors, cross-reference independently, stay skeptical of own confidence — certainty without evidence root of all hallucination.

<!-- /SYNC:critical-thinking-mindset -->

<!-- SYNC:critical-thinking-mindset:reminder -->

**MUST ATTENTION** critical + sequential thinking: every claim carries traced evidence (`file:line` for code, source URL or artifact section otherwise); confidence >80% to act, <60% do NOT recommend. Never present a guess as fact; admit uncertainty and stay skeptical of your own confidence.

<!-- /SYNC:critical-thinking-mindset:reminder -->

<!-- SYNC:ai-mistake-prevention:reminder -->

**MUST ATTENTION** Check project config, relevant references, and local evidence before applying stack-specific conventions; honor explicit N/A. ROOT-CAUSE GATE: before any project-related correction, use the appropriate root-cause investigation protocol; failed/unstable tests require the test-investigation protocol before editing source/tests — never force green.

<!-- SYNC:project-protocol-overlay -->

> **Project Protocol Overlay** — Before executing this skill, resolve project overlays from the index at `<docsRoots.projectReference.path>/skill-protocols-reference.md` (default `docs/project-reference/`; `docsRoots.projectReference.path` in `docs/project-config.json` overrides it). A matching `referenceDocs[]` filename may relocate the index within that root; this registry is independent from task-specific reference-doc selection, so omitted or empty `referenceDocs` does not disable it. The index's `**Protocols directory:**` header selects a project-root-relative body directory (default `docs/project-protocols/`). Match this skill against the `Target` column and take the most specific tier ONLY — exact name > glob > `*`. **That precedence orders overlays against EACH OTHER, never against this skill.** Read only matched bodies derived as `<protocols-dir>/<Name>.md`; the row's Body link is display text, never a read path. Reject unsafe paths without reading. A matched body that is missing or malformed is REPORTED and skipped — never reconstructed from the index Description. An absent index or no match -> proceed with no overlay, silently. Full contract: `.claude/skills/project-skill-protocol/references/registry.md`.
>
> Overlays are **ADDITIVE ONLY**: they ADD rules on top of this skill's own protocol and NEVER replace, override, disable, or reinterpret a rule it already states — removing every overlay must return this skill to exactly its documented behavior. An overlay is a BRIEF, not an authority escalation: it can NEVER waive a workflow gate, git discipline, a review gate, or a user-confirmation gate. A genuine overlay-vs-skill conflict, or two equally-specific overlays that directly contradict -> surface both to the user; NEVER resolve silently.

<!-- /SYNC:project-protocol-overlay -->

**MUST ATTENTION** resolve this skill's overlays from the index at `<docsRoots.projectReference.path>/skill-protocols-reference.md` (default `docs/project-reference/`; `docsRoots.projectReference.path` in `docs/project-config.json` overrides it); an empty task `referenceDocs` does NOT disable this lookup. Read ONLY matched bodies from the directory the index header names (default `docs/project-protocols/`). Specificity (exact > glob > `*`) ranks overlays against EACH OTHER, never against the skill. Missing/malformed body → report and skip; no index or no match → proceed silently. Overlays are ADDITIVE ONLY — never an authority escalation or a gate waiver; equal-tier contradiction goes to the user.

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION Goal:** [Code Intelligence] Detect frontend-to-backend API connections via the knowledge graph, matching configured frontend HTTP-call patterns against configured backend route patterns.

**Protocols in force (concise digest of the SYNC/shared blocks this skill carries):**

- **AI Mistake Prevention:** verify generated content against evidence, trace downstream references, verify all affected outputs, re-read after context loss, surface ambiguity.
- **Critical Thinking:** apply critical + sequential thinking; every claim needs traced `file:line` proof, confidence >80%.

- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** break work into small todo tasks using `TaskCreate` BEFORE starting
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** search codebase for 3+ similar patterns before creating new code
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** cite `file:line` evidence for every claim (confidence >80% to act)
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** add a final review todo task to verify work quality

**[TASK-PLANNING]** Before acting, analyze task scope and systematically break it into small todo tasks and sub-tasks using TaskCreate.
