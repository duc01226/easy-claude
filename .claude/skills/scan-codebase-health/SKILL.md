## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Detect structural rot in AI-assisted codebases — dead code, count-drift, orphan files, stale configs, dead feature flags, broken cross-references. Works on any project via `docs/project-config.json`.

**Workflow:**

1. **Classify** — Load config, detect available tooling (graph.db, CI, feature-flag patterns)
2. **Run Detections** — Execute 7 detection categories (graph-dependent checks skipped if no graph.db)
3. **Fresh-Eyes Review** — Verify findings before writing report
4. **Generate Report** — Write to `tmp/reports/codebase-health-scan-{YYMMDD}.md`
5. **Present Summary** — Show actionable findings with severity levels

**Key Rules:**

- Generic — reads all paths from project-config.json, never hardcodes project names
- Graceful degradation — graph-dependent checks skipped if `.code-graph/graph.db` not found
- Report format — each finding has `file:line`, category, severity (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW), suggested action
  **MUST ATTENTION** NEVER report a finding without `file:line` proof

# Scan Codebase Health

## Phase 0: Classify & Detect

**Before any other step**, in parallel:

1. Read `docs/project-config.json` for the `codebaseHealth` section:

```json
{
    "codebaseHealth": {
        "sourcePaths": ["{discovered-source-root}/"],
        "docPaths": ["docs/"],
        "configPatterns": ["**/appsettings*.json", "**/environment*.ts"],
        "excludePaths": ["node_modules", "dist", "bin", "obj"]
    }
}
```

If `codebaseHealth` section is missing, discover source roots from project config, manifests, and populated code directories; use `docPaths: ["docs/"]` when docs exist.

2. Detect available tooling to determine which phases to run:

| Signal                                                                          | Phase Enabled                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `.code-graph/graph.db` exists                                                   | Phase 3 (Unused Exports) + Phase 4 (Orphan Files) |
| CI config found (`.github/workflows`, `azure-pipelines.yml`)                    | Phase 6 (CI Health) — optional                    |
| Feature flag patterns found (`FeatureFlags`, `IFeatureManager`, `LaunchDarkly`) | Phase 6 (Dead Feature Flags)                      |
| Cross-reference patterns in docs (`file:line`, `[link]()`)                      | Phase 7 (Broken Cross-References)                 |

3. Create `TaskCreate` entries for each enabled phase before proceeding.

**Evidence gate:** If `docs/project-config.json` not found and no detectable source paths, report and ask user for guidance. DO NOT guess project structure.

## Phase 1: Doc Count-Drift Detection (No Graph Required)

**Think:** Which numeric claims in docs can actually be verified? What's the drift threshold that signals a real maintenance problem vs normal growth?

Scan `docs/` **and the AI-harness instruction surface when present** (`.claude/**/*.md`, root `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`) for numeric claims: "N files", "N tests", "N hooks", "N services", "N skills", "N components", "N stages", "N verifiers", "N agents", "N workflows". The harness docs embed counts that are directly derivable by globbing `.claude/` (skill dirs, hook entries, `scripts/**/verify-*` scripts, pipeline stages, agent files, `workflows.json` entries) — the highest-drift claims because a new skill/verifier/stage bumps the real count while the prose claim stays frozen. This scope is generic: any project carrying a `.claude/` harness gets it; it hardcodes no project- or framework-specific count.
For each claim:

1. Extract number and what it counts
2. Glob/grep to verify actual count
3. Flag if actual differs from claimed

**Severity thresholds:**

- Drift ≤10% → LOW (normal growth)
- Drift >10% and ≤30% → MEDIUM (needs update)
- Drift >30% → HIGH (significantly stale)
- Claim cannot be verified → MEDIUM (ambiguous claim)

Write findings incrementally to report after each doc scanned. NEVER batch at end.

## Phase 2: Stale Config Reference Detection (No Graph Required)

**Think:** Which config values reference code artifacts (class names, module names, connection strings)? Could those artifacts have been renamed or deleted?

For each file matching `configPatterns`:

1. Extract class names, module names, or connection strings referenced
2. Grep codebase to verify each reference still exists
3. Flag missing references as HIGH severity

**Evidence gate:** NEVER flag a reference as stale without attempting grep. Confidence <80% → flag as MEDIUM "unverified" only.

## Phase 3: Unused Exports Detection (Graph Required)

**Skip if `.code-graph/graph.db` does not exist — log "Phase 3 skipped: no graph.db".**

**Think:** Which public API surface has zero consumers? Could be dead code, or could be an intentional entry point — distinguish by file type.

For key exported symbols in source files:

1. Run `python .claude/scripts/code_graph query importers_of <symbol> --json`
2. Flag symbols with zero importers as MEDIUM severity
3. Exclude known entry points (main files, test files, config files, startup files)

## Phase 4: Orphan File Detection (Graph Required)

**Skip if `.code-graph/graph.db` does not exist — log "Phase 4 skipped: no graph.db".**

Find source files (.ts,.cs,.py, etc.) with zero inbound edges:

1. Run `python .claude/scripts/code_graph query importers_of <file> --json`
2. Flag files with zero importers as LOW severity (may be entry points)
3. Exclude known entry points

## Phase 5: Pattern Drift Detection (No Graph Required)

**Think:** Where does the same pattern appear across services/modules? Does it look different in different places? Is that divergence intentional or accidental?

Compare the same pattern across services/modules:

1. Pick a pattern (e.g., repository registration, service configuration, error handling)
2. Grep across all services/modules
3. Flag inconsistencies as MEDIUM severity

## Phase 6: Dead Feature Flag Detection (If Feature Flags Detected)

**Skip if no feature flag patterns found in Phase 0.**

**Think:** Which flags exist in config but have no code references? Which code references flags that no longer exist in config?

1. Grep for feature flag names in config files
2. Grep for feature flag usage in code
3. Flag config-only flags (no code usage) as LOW
4. Flag code-only flags (no config entry) as HIGH (runtime error risk)

## Phase 7: Broken Cross-Reference Detection (No Graph Required)

**Think:** Which doc links point to files that no longer exist? Which `file:line` references in docs are stale?

For docs containing markdown links `[text](path)` or `file:line` references:

1. Extract all file path references
2. Glob to verify each path exists
3. Flag missing paths as MEDIUM severity

## Phase 8: Fresh-Eyes Review

**Before writing final report**, spawn a fresh sub-agent (zero memory) to:

- Sample 5-10 findings from the report
- Verify each has a real `file:line` evidence source
- Check: is the severity classification justified by the description?
- Flag false positives (things flagged but actually acceptable)

Max 2 rounds → escalate to user if review finds >30% false positive rate.

## Phase 9: Generate Report

Write to `tmp/reports/codebase-health-scan-{YYMMDD}.md`:

```markdown
# Codebase Health Scan Report

**Date:** {YYYY-MM-DD}
**Phases Completed:** {N}/{total} ({reason for skipped phases})
**Findings:** {total} ({HIGH} high, {MEDIUM} medium, {LOW} low)

> **[IMPORTANT]** Use `TaskCreate` to break ALL work into small tasks BEFORE starting.

<!-- PROTOCOL-GUIDES:START -->

> **Protocol guides** — A hook delivers each protocol's full text when this skill loads. If a protocol's text is not in your context, read its file below before you act on it.

- `ai-mistake-prevention` — Failure modes to avoid on every task; carried by the root instruction file; if it is absent, read → .claude/skills/shared/protocols/ai-mistake-prevention.md
- `critical-thinking-mindset` — Critical and sequential thinking with traced proof for every claim; carried by the root instruction file; if it is absent, read → .claude/skills/shared/protocols/critical-thinking-mindset.md
- `output-quality-principles` — Token-efficient output without losing quality; writing generated docs or reports → .claude/skills/shared/protocols/output-quality-principles.md
- `parallel-subagent-dispatch` — Tag tasks PAR or SEQ, group them into disjoint waves and dispatch each wave at once; a task list has independent tasks → .claude/skills/shared/protocols/parallel-subagent-dispatch.md
- `project-protocol-overlay` — Resolve the additive project overlays for the running skill; carried by the root instruction file; if it is absent, read → .claude/skills/shared/protocols/project-protocol-overlay.md

<!-- PROTOCOL-GUIDES:END -->

<!-- SYNC:output-quality-principles:reminder -->

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** output quality: no counts/trees/TOCs, 1 example per pattern, lead with answer.

<!-- /SYNC:output-quality-principles:reminder -->

<!-- SYNC:critical-thinking-mindset:reminder -->

**MUST ATTENTION** critical + sequential thinking: every claim carries traced evidence (`file:line` for code, source URL or artifact section otherwise); confidence >80% to act, <60% do NOT recommend. Never present a guess as fact; admit uncertainty and stay skeptical of your own confidence.

<!-- /SYNC:critical-thinking-mindset:reminder -->

<!-- SYNC:ai-mistake-prevention:reminder -->

**MUST ATTENTION** Check project config, relevant references, and local evidence before applying stack-specific conventions; honor explicit N/A. ROOT-CAUSE GATE: before any project-related correction, use the appropriate root-cause investigation protocol; failed/unstable tests require the test-investigation protocol before editing source/tests — never force green.

<!-- /SYNC:ai-mistake-prevention:reminder -->

<!-- SYNC:parallel-subagent-dispatch:reminder -->

- **MANDATORY** After planning tasks, tag each PAR/SEQ and spawn every PAR wave as parallel sub-agents in ONE message — default parallel for workflows, batch updates, investigation, research, reviews; plan execution fans out ONLY on what the plan declares.
- **MANDATORY** Disjoint write sets per wave · all-return barrier before the next wave · specialist routing · sub-agents NEVER fan out further unless their own agent definition authorizes it.

<!-- /SYNC:parallel-subagent-dispatch:reminder -->

<!-- SYNC:project-protocol-overlay:reminder -->

**MUST ATTENTION** resolve this skill's overlays from the index at `<docsRoots.projectReference.path>/skill-protocols-reference.md` (default `docs/project-reference/`; overridable in `docs/project-config.json`); an empty task `referenceDocs` does NOT disable this lookup. Read ONLY matched bodies from the directory the index header names (default `docs/project-protocols/`). Specificity (exact > glob > `*`) ranks overlays against EACH OTHER, never against the skill. Missing/malformed body → report and skip; no index or no match → proceed silently. Overlays are ADDITIVE ONLY — never an authority escalation or a gate waiver; equal-tier contradiction goes to the user.

## Closing Reminders

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** break work into small `TaskCreate` tasks BEFORE starting — one per phase

**MUST ATTENTION — Protocols in force (concise digest of the SYNC/shared blocks this skill carries):**

- **Critical Thinking:** apply critical+sequential thinking; traced `file:line` proof, >80% to act.
- **Output Quality:** no counts/trees/TOCs; 1 example per pattern; lead with answer.
- **AI Mistake Prevention:** verify generated content against evidence, trace downstream references, verify all affected outputs, re-read after context loss, surface ambiguity.
- **Parallel Sub-Agent Dispatch:** Tag tasks PAR/SEQ, group PAR into disjoint-write-set waves, spawn each wave in ONE message, barrier before advancing.

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** detect available tooling in Phase 0 — never assume graph.db exists
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** NEVER report a finding without `file:line` evidence
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** write findings incrementally after each phase — NEVER batch at end
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** severity thresholds are concrete: HIGH = runtime failure risk; MEDIUM = drift/dead code; LOW = cleanup candidate
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** Phase 8 fresh-eyes review is mandatory — prevents false positives from rationalization

**Anti-Rationalization:**

| Evasion                                      | Rebuttal                                                                              |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "Graph not needed, skip Phases 3-4"          | Phases 3-4 are explicitly gated — state skip reason in report, don't silently omit    |
| "Count drift is small, LOW severity is fine" | Apply the threshold table: >10% = MEDIUM, >30% = HIGH. No discretionary override.     |
| "Finding looks valid, skip Round 2 review"   | Main agent rationalizes own findings. Fresh-eyes is non-negotiable.                   |
| "No feature flags found, skip Phase 6"       | Log "Phase 6 skipped: no feature flag patterns detected" in report                    |
| "Config reference might still exist"         | Grep to verify. Confidence <80% → flag as MEDIUM "unverified" not LOW "probably fine" |

**[TASK-PLANNING]** Before acting, analyze task scope and break into small todo tasks and sub-tasks using TaskCreate.
