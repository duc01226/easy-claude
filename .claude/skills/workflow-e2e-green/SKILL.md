<!-- PROMPT-ENHANCE:STEP-TASK-ANCHOR:END -->

## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Preserve the old `workflow-e2e-green` name during migration without maintaining a second E2E workflow. The canonical route now writes or updates tests when needed, then runs `e2e-test-verify-loop` for configured verification, failure adjudication, owning-layer fixes, and fresh same-scope reruns.

**Replacement:** Use `$workflow-e2e --source=changes|recording|update-ui` when an E2E artifact must be written or updated, or `$workflow-e2e --source=prompt|context|whole` when the loop should select or generate the case. Forward `--visual-review=true|false`; the default remains true and false is an explicit opt-out.

**Canonical lifecycle:** `/investigate → /e2e-test (conditional authoring) → /e2e-test-verify-loop → /docs-update → /workflow-end → /watzup`.

**Migration rule:** Do not execute this deprecated entry as an independent green workflow and do not run a second `experience-review` or `test` pass. Re-route to `workflow-e2e`; `e2e-test-verify-loop` is the single convergence owner. If the invocation came through an old `/start-workflow workflow-e2e-green` command, restart it as `/start-workflow workflow-e2e` with the resolved source and visual flag.

## Compatibility notes

- Preserve the requested scope and protected invariant when re-routing; never silently widen, narrow, skip, weaken, or auto-accept a baseline.
- Read `docs/project-config.json` and the linked E2E reference before selecting a runner, lifecycle, browser, account, data path, or evidence location.
- The canonical loop owns visible browser evidence, screenshot inspection through `/experience-review --rounds=0` when enabled, failure taxonomy, `/debug-investigate`, `/fix`, `/changes-review`, and fresh reruns.
- If the project has no configured E2E capability, preserve the evidence-backed `N/A` result; an applicable but unavailable capability is `ENVIRONMENT-BLOCKED`.

> **Incremental Result Persistence** — MANDATORY for every visual-artifact review and for all sub-agents or heavy inline steps processing >3 files.
>
> 1. **Before starting:** Create report file `tmp/reports/{skill}-{date}-{slug}.md` and record Run ID, Task ID, Attempt ID, target scope, and target fingerprint. When visual artifacts are in scope, also record their ordered inventory and total; identify each screenshot, image, photo, or snapshot by path/name plus state and viewport when known.
> 2. **Checkpoint each review unit:** After each file or section, append findings, evidence, changed paths, and gaps immediately. For visual artifacts, open exactly ONE artifact, inspect it, and append its record BEFORE opening the next artifact. Each record includes artifact identity, state/viewport, inspection status, observations, severity-tagged issues with evidence, an explicit `none` when no issue exists, and any gap. NEVER batch multiple visual artifacts into one later write and never hold their findings in memory.
> 2a. **Resume from disk:** Treat the report's artifact records as the progress ledger. After interruption or context loss, read the report, derive processed and remaining artifacts from the ordered inventory, and continue at the first unprocessed artifact without duplicating completed records.
> 3. **Delegated return:** A sub-agent emits only the structured `SYNC:subagent-return-contract` envelope with exact totals, salient Critical/High findings (maximum ten), current attempt, and `Full report:` path. **Inline user-facing output:** Preserve the skill's requested explanation or teaching, with links to the persisted evidence; the delegated transport limit does not replace that deliverable. Do not paste a full review report into an envelope.
> 4. **Parent synthesis from persisted evidence:** The main agent reads the full report for synthesis, acceptance, deduplication, and repair planning — not only when a named blocker exists. For visual review, reconcile the ordered inventory against the artifact records before concluding; a missing record is incomplete review, never a clean result. Preserve all severities beyond the transport cap.
> 5. **Read-only boundary:** A read-only leaf may write its report/repair proposal but MUST NOT edit source, generated output, or user data; the parent/owner performs repairs after acceptance.
> 6. **Advancement gate:** The parent records `ACCEPTED` for the current Attempt ID only after reconciling target, totals, gaps, and changed paths; stale or late attempts cannot advance dependent work.
>
> **Why:** Context cutoff mid-execution loses ALL in-memory findings, and a large image set makes a final batch write especially fragile. Each per-unit disk write survives compaction. Partial results are better than no results, while explicit identity prevents a late result or a resumed image from being mistaken for the current run.

> **AI Mistake Prevention** — Failure modes to avoid on every task:
>
> **ROOT-CAUSE GATE — INVESTIGATE FIRST.** Before applying any project-related correction, always use the project's root-cause investigation protocol and establish the cause; the failure site may be only a symptom.
> **FAILED-TEST GATE.** For any failed or unstable test, use the project's test-investigation protocol before editing source or tests; never change either side merely to force green.
> **Re-read files after context changes.** Context compaction, resume, or long-running work can make memory stale; verify current files before acting.
> **Verify generated content against source evidence.** AI hallucinates APIs, names, claims, and document facts. Check the relevant source before documenting or referencing.
> **Check downstream references before deleting or renaming.** Removing an artifact can stale docs, generated mirrors, configs, and callers; map references first.
> **Trace the full impact chain after edits.** Changing a definition can miss derived outputs and consumers. Follow the affected chain before declaring done.
> **Verify ALL affected outputs, not just the first.** One green check is not all green checks; validate every output surface the change can affect.
> **Assume existing values are intentional — ask WHY before changing OR flagging one as a defect.** Before changing or reporting a constant, limit, flag, cutoff, wording, or pattern, read nearby context and history, the CALLER's ordering, and 2+ sibling call sites of the same convention. A doc stating WHAT without WHY is missing rationale, not proof of a missing guard.
> **Surface ambiguity before acting — don't pick silently.** Multiple valid interpretations require an explicit question or stated assumption with risk.
> **Assert the outcome your system owns, not the intermediate state your infrastructure owns.** When verifying async work, assert the final business state — never the delivery/retry bookkeeping held in shared infrastructure that any co-running process can write. Such a check passes when run alone and flakes the moment anything else shares that infrastructure.
> **Store disposable generated output in the project workspace.** If an output can be regenerated and is not source code, a canonical source-of-truth, or an intentionally versioned projection, write it under the project-root `tmp/` or `temp/` directory (prefer `tmp/`), scoped to the run. This includes temporary state, integration/E2E results, reports, logs, screenshots, traces, videos, coverage, dumps, and candidate evidence. Never put these outputs in source, docs, `plans/`, `team-artifacts/`, or mirror directories; the project-root `.gitignore` must ignore `/tmp/` and `/temp/` by default. Committed fixtures, accepted baselines, canonical specs/docs, and explicitly versioned generated mirrors remain at their declared owner paths.
> **Keep shared guidance role-relevant.** Universal guidance must help every receiving skill or agent; code-specific obligations belong only in code-specific protocols.

<!-- SYNC:project-protocol-overlay -->

> **Project Protocol Overlay** — Before executing this skill, resolve any PROJECT overlay rules layered onto it: match this skill's name against the `Target` column of the project's skill-protocol index (`docs/project-reference/skill-protocols-reference.md` by default; a `referenceDocs` entry in `docs/project-config.json` overrides the path), taking the most specific matching tier ONLY — exact name > glob > `*`. **That precedence orders overlays against EACH OTHER, never against this skill.** Read ONLY the matched bodies, resolved as `<protocols-dir>/<Name>.md`; a row's Body link is display text, never a read path. A matched body that is missing or malformed is REPORTED and skipped — never reconstructed from the index Description. No index, or no match -> proceed with no overlay, silently. Full contract: `.claude/skills/project-skill-protocol/references/registry.md`.
>
> Overlays are **ADDITIVE ONLY**: they ADD rules on top of this skill's own protocol and NEVER replace, override, disable, or reinterpret a rule it already states — removing every overlay must return this skill to exactly its documented behavior. An overlay is a BRIEF, not an authority escalation: it can NEVER waive a workflow gate, git discipline, a review gate, or a user-confirmation gate. A genuine overlay-vs-skill conflict, or two equally-specific overlays that directly contradict -> surface both to the user; NEVER resolve silently.

<!-- SYNC:e2e-visual-design-contract -->

> **E2E Visual Design Contract** — Binds when this skill or agent handles `--visual-review=true`, screenshot/recording evidence, human-QC of a user-facing UI, or visual expectation/baseline updates; for non-visual E2E/API/CLI work state `N/A — no user-facing visual surface` and do not invent a design review.
>
> 1. **Resolve authority first.** Read `docs/project-config.json`, its `designSystem.canonicalDoc`, `tokenFiles`, and `appMappings[]`, plus the resolved `design-system/README.md`, `frontend-patterns-reference.md`, `scss-styling-guide.md`, `.claude/docs/design-knowledge.md`, and `.claude/docs/design-review-checklist.md`; record `N/A` only for a proven absent surface or `ENVIRONMENT-BLOCKED` for an applicable missing capability — never invent tokens, components, breakpoints, type, CSS/BEM, or runner defaults.
> 2. **Use project decisions.** Apply precedence: brief/accepted design contract → adopter project design-system/SCSS/frontend docs and ADRs → shared `UI-1.1`–`UI-9.4`, `DD-1`–`DD-8`, and `CL-1`–`CL-6`; surface a genuine conflict with both sides, never silently choose. Read and apply the full shared `SYNC:design-system-check`, `SYNC:ui-ux-design-principles`, `SYNC:design-distinctiveness-gate`, and `SYNC:design-review-checklist` bodies for their applicable roles. When UI generation or repair is in scope, consume the accepted `/design` decisions (or the adopter's equivalent professional design/component system); review-only E2E evidence must not invent a new visual language.
> 3. **Map UI architecture before generation or UI fixes.** Inventory related screens, flows, and components; classify each relevant component `Common`, `Domain-Shared`, or `Page`; record its base abstraction and owner; reuse/compose before creating; record why reuse does not fit; keep one owner for markup, selectors, styling, lifecycle, and lower-tier test contracts. Page tests cover composition/outcomes, not copied lower-tier behavior.
> 4. **Separate review owners.** Use `/experience-review` for the running surface and opened/read screenshot evidence; route source-only token, BEM/SCSS, z-index, component ownership, reuse, and static design findings to `/ui-review`. Never infer source architecture or design tokens from an image, and never treat a passing E2E command as visual/design approval.
> 5. **Gate every visual round.** Capture every declared state × viewport (including loading, empty, error, permission, post-submit, and full-page where applicable), open/read each artifact, and record state, viewport, location, and measured values. `UI-*`/accessibility/layout-floor and `P0`–`P2` `CL-*` findings are `BLOCKING`; `DD-*` identity/polish is `ADVISORY` unless the governing brief/project contract makes it objectively required. Unmeasurable values are `NOT VERIFIABLE`; never promote a baseline/expectation automatically.
> 6. **Report the contract.** Persist authority paths and resolution status, component tier/base/owner/reuse decisions, matrix coverage, `UI`/`DD`/`CL` coverage or skips, evidence/read status, and remaining human acceptance; preserve the protected business invariant and exact E2E scope.

  **MUST ATTENTION** resolve project protocol overlays for this skill BEFORE executing — most specific matching tier only (exact > glob > `*`, which ranks overlays against each other, NEVER against this skill), read only matched bodies at `<protocols-dir>/<Name>.md`; a missing or malformed body is reported, never reconstructed. Overlays are ADDITIVE ONLY (they never replace this skill's own rules) and are a brief, NEVER an authority escalation; an equal-specificity contradiction goes to the user.

**MUST ATTENTION** visual E2E/QC resolves the project design authority first, applies project design-system/SCSS/frontend decisions plus `UI-*`/`DD-*`/`CL-*` roles, classifies Common/Domain-Shared/Page ownership and reuse, sends static source findings to `/ui-review` and runtime image evidence to `/experience-review`, reads every state × viewport artifact, treats UI/accessibility-floor findings as blocking and DD identity/polish as advisory, never invents measurements, and never auto-promotes baselines; non-visual runs state `N/A`.

<!-- /SYNC:e2e-visual-design-contract:reminder -->

## Closing Reminders

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION Goal:** Drive the fixed configured E2E scope through visible human-QC evidence and bounded debug/fix/retest convergence, preserving the protected invariant and reporting an honest terminal result.

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** visual screenshot review is enabled by default (equivalent to `--visual-review=true`): run E2E, capture and open/read every generated screenshot in the complete screenshot state × viewport matrix through `/experience-review --rounds=0`, fix validated blocking UI defects at the owning UI layer, and rerun the same scope. `--visual-review=false` is the explicit opt-out; `/ask` is architecture consultation, not screenshot review.

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** use the reusable bounded `waitUntil(condition, options)` before and after every interactive browser/UI action, including applicable error-alert states, then apply the exact 500ms presentation delay last; preserve scope, evidence, assertions, and accepted expectations.
