# Presentation principles

Use this as the content and structure rubric for any subject. It is a decision aid, not a fixed template: audience, goal, environment, subject, and time determine the final sequence.

## 1. Communication foundation

1. Name the **audience**, **goal**, and **environment** before choosing a slide pattern. The same material needs different altitude, vocabulary, evidence, and interaction for a boardroom, classroom, conference, async reader, or technical review.
2. Write one sentence answering: “After this presentation, what should the audience understand, believe, decide, remember, or do?” If there are several jobs, identify the primary one and make the others supporting jobs.
3. Set the evidence boundary. Separate fact, interpretation, recommendation, scenario, and illustration. Mark uncertainty instead of using confident language to hide it.
4. Choose a length by the audience job and available time. There is no universal slide count; remove anything that does not advance the outcome.
5. Design for the audience’s view, not the presenter’s script. Slides should carry the minimum information needed to establish context, understand, compare, remember, or act; notes carry delivery detail.

## 2. Narrative architecture

1. **Open with context and relevance.** State the subject, why it matters now, and what the audience will get. Use a hook only when it serves the subject; novelty without relevance is noise.
2. **State the thesis early.** For a decision or persuasive deck, use BLUF: recommendation, consequence, and the decision/ask. For teaching or reporting, state the central question or finding.
3. **Preview the route.** Give a short roadmap when the audience benefits from knowing the sequence. Replace a ceremonial agenda with a useful map of questions, stages, or decisions.
4. **Give the story a tension or question.** A problem, contrast, trade-off, mystery, user need, failed assumption, or change over time gives the audience a reason to continue.
5. **Progress by an intelligible relationship.** Each adjacent slide should connect by cause, contrast, chronology, increasing specificity, question/answer, or evidence/implication. Add a signpost when the relationship is not obvious.
6. **Make every slide do one job.** Put one primary claim or question in the title/body relationship. If two claims need different evidence, split or redesign the slide.
7. **Use assertion-led titles when appropriate.** “Retention falls after the second handoff” is more useful than “Retention analysis.” Topic titles are acceptable when the slide is genuinely establishing context rather than arguing.
8. **Earn credibility.** Show the important evidence, baseline, method, source, limitations, alternatives, and trade-offs. Do not make the audience infer the strongest counterargument.
9. **Move from meaning to action.** After evidence, state the insight or implication, then options, recommendation, plan, ownership, timing, and risk. Do not end at “here is the problem.”
10. **Close deliberately.** Re-state the memorable takeaway, connect back to the opening question, and make the next action/decision, owner, and timing explicit. A close is not a smaller copy of the agenda.

## 3. Narrative archetypes

| Job | Minimum sequence | Use when | Failure to avoid |
|---|---|---|---|
| Decision | BLUF → context → evidence → options/trade-offs → recommendation → risks/plan → ask | The audience must choose or authorize | Hiding the decision until the last slide |
| Persuasion | relevance → tension → insight → proof → objection handling → value → call to action | The audience must change a belief or behavior | Hype without proof or a concrete action |
| Teaching | learning objective → prior knowledge → concept → worked example → practice/check → recap → next step | The audience must learn and use a concept | Definitions without an observable example |
| Story | setting → character/need → obstacle → attempts → turning point → resolution → meaning | A human or organizational change is the message | Chronology without stakes or interpretation |
| Research/report | question → method/scope → findings → interpretation → limitations → implications | The audience needs a trustworthy account of inquiry | Showing data without answering “so what?” |
| Demo | promise → starting context → guided path → key moments → result → boundary/next step | The audience must see an experience or workflow | A feature tour with no user goal or end state |
| Comparison | decision criteria → candidates → evidence by criterion → trade-offs → recommendation | Options are being evaluated | A scorecard with hidden weights or false precision |
| Status/roadmap | outcome since last point → current state → evidence → risks/blockers → next milestones → ask | The audience needs alignment on progress | Activity lists without outcomes or ownership |
| Portfolio/case study | brief → constraint → choices → artifact/process → result → reflection | The work itself demonstrates judgment | Beauty shots with no reasoning or result |

Use a hybrid only when the transition is explicit. For example, a research deck may become a decision deck after the findings; label that turn rather than repeating the same context.

## 4. Slide map and slide-level contract

Before generating the artifact, make a map with these fields:

| Field | Required question |
|---|---|
| `slide-id` | Can the slide be named and jumped to stably? |
| `purpose` | What audience job does it perform? |
| `claim` | What one sentence should be understood or remembered? |
| `evidence/visual` | What earns the claim, and is it sourced/labelled? |
| `transition` | Why does the next slide follow this one? |
| `timing` | How much of the talk budget does it consume? |
| `notes-status` | Are detailed notes complete, or is the slide blocked? |

Each slide should answer, in order appropriate to its job:

- What is this slide about?
- What should the audience notice first?
- What is the claim or question?
- What evidence, example, diagram, or comparison supports it?
- What should the audience conclude or do next?

Recommended anchors are cover/opening context, thesis or question, context, tension, evidence, insight, options/plan, risks/limitations, ask/next action, and close. Add methodology, definitions, appendix, or source detail only when they serve the audience or enable trust.

## 5. Content and visual reasoning

1. Use a title that carries meaning; use body copy to support it, not repeat it.
2. Make the first visual glance answer “where am I?” and “what matters?” Use scale, position, contrast, and whitespace as a hierarchy, not decoration.
3. Prefer one meaningful image, diagram, or chart over a wall of prose. A visual must explain a relationship, object, process, place, person, or emotion; decorative imagery consumes attention without carrying the story.
4. Simplify charts: clear units, time range, denominator, baseline, source, direct labels, honest scale, and a takeaway. Never use 3D, decoration, or colour to imply significance the data does not support.
5. Use progressive disclosure when detail is necessary: headline first, evidence second, caveat/definition third. Keep dense material in notes or appendix when it is not needed for the live decision.
6. Keep labels, legends, acronyms, and technical terms close to the thing they explain. Use the audience’s words and define unavoidable specialist language once.
7. Vary layout when the information relationship changes. A repeated card grid, uniform bullets, or identical title treatment on every slide signals that the content was fitted to a template.
8. Ground visual choices in the subject. Name why the palette, type, metaphor, material, diagram style, and focal image belong to this story; reject a generic default when the brief leaves an axis open.
9. Make every visual accessible: meaningful alternative text or label, logical reading order, sufficient text and edge contrast, non-colour encoding, captions/transcripts where needed, and a semantic text path for complex diagrams.

## 6. Delivery, notes, and pacing

1. Notes are a presenter layer, not a dumping ground. Every slide gets notes even when the visible slide is sparse.
2. Per-slide notes should include: **Say** (natural talk track), **Why** (interpretation and audience relevance), **Evidence** (source/method/caveat), **Transition**, **Timing**, and **Question** (likely challenge plus concise answer). Add pronunciation, demo setup, or backup detail when relevant.
3. Write notes for handoff: another presenter should know the intended emphasis, what not to claim, what to point at, and how to recover if the audience asks a predictable question.
4. Rehearse the real path aloud. Check total time, transitions, opening/close memorability, audience comprehension, dense slides, and whether a slide can be removed without breaking the story.
5. Provide a self-serve reading path for asynchronous use: descriptive titles, visible source/caveat labels, stable slide IDs/jump links, and enough context for a reader who cannot hear the notes.
6. Never auto-advance a decision or teaching deck. Let the presenter control the pace and provide a pause path for animations, demos, captions, and questions.

## 7. Final structure review

| Review question | Pass condition |
|---|---|
| Can the audience name the thesis after the opening? | Yes, in their words, without waiting for the conclusion. |
| Does every slide advance the thesis/question? | Yes; repeated, ornamental, or “because we had the data” slides are removed. |
| Can each transition be explained? | Yes; the sequence is causal, contrastive, chronological, or explicitly signposted. |
| Is the strongest proof visible? | Yes; source, comparison, uncertainty, and relevant counterpoint are not buried. |
| Does the recommendation follow from the evidence? | Yes; options and trade-offs make the reasoning inspectable. |
| Is the ask actionable? | Yes; decision/action, owner, timing, and immediate next step are named. |
| Does the close land? | Yes; one memorable takeaway and a clear next action remain after the final slide. |
| Could a new presenter deliver it? | Yes; every slide has complete notes and known caveats. |
| Could a reader use it without the presenter? | Yes; titles, sources, labels, navigation, and context survive self-serve reading. |
