# Security audit — D9 CI/CD & Build Pipeline

> Read when D9 is in scope: `full`, or `changes` with CI/workflow files changed.

- [ ] No script injection: workflow files never interpolate untrusted input (PR titles, branch names, issue bodies) into `run:` shell lines
- [ ] `pull_request_target` / elevated-permission triggers never check out and execute PR code
- [ ] Third-party actions/plugins pinned by commit SHA, not floating tags
- [ ] Secrets scoped per-job/environment minimum; not exposed to PR builds from forks; never echoed to logs
- [ ] Build artifacts: integrity verified between build and deploy; deploy creds not reachable from build steps that run third-party code
- [ ] Branch protection on default branches; force-push restricted
