## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Converge a review scope to a **clean no-op pass** by re-running the ENTIRE `/workflow-review-changes` workflow INLINE, round after round, over a fixed scope combined with the fixes accumulated so far — stopping when a complete round applies **zero fixes**. **From round 2 the severity floor applies: LOW findings are no longer fixed, so a round that surfaces only LOW findings, with no other edit landing, is a zero-fix round and ENDS the loop.**

**Summary:**

- **Steps (in order):** (0) resolve scope + Goal Contract → (0b) bind the convergence loop (protocol loop primary + optional `/goal` accelerator) → (1) round loop { run `/workflow-review-changes` INLINE → detect fixes-applied → log iteration } → (2) converge on a zero-fix round OR escalate on non-progress → (3) recap.
- **Convergence:** stop ONLY when a whole round applies **zero fixes** (its fix cycle skipped, working tree unchanged, reviews clean) — not merely one clean review.
- **Inline invariant:** run `/workflow-review-changes` via the `Skill` tool, NEVER the `Agent` tool — it self-binds its own review-loop obligation (owning the session Stop hook for its `/goal` gate WHEN available), which a sub-agent cannot own or carry back to this loop.
- **Severity floor — from round 2, LOW stops blocking.** Round 1 fix every validated severity. **From round 2 tell the inner `/workflow-review-changes` to fix only CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM and to defer LOW findings** — a round whose validated findings are ALL LOW therefore applies no review fix and CONVERGES once no other edit (such as a `/code-simplifier` change) lands. Carry every deferred LOW into the recap and Goal Contract; NEVER re-tier a real CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM down to LOW to reach the exit. Severity tiers per `SYNC:severity-rubric`.
- **Bounded:** round cap default 2 plus one conditional extension to round 3, granted ONLY when round 2 leaves a validated CRITICAL/HIGH open (round 3 is the review hard cap); a failing test gate has NO round cap — keep fixing and re-running until the tests pass; review blockers not shrinking across 2 rounds (checked only after the round-2 CRITICAL/HIGH extension, which is granted first), or the budget spent with fixes still landing (CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM fixes, or edits with no review blocker open) → **STOP & escalate** via `AskUserQuestion`.

**Why this skill exists (READ FIRST — it is the whole justification):** `/workflow-review-changes` already converges *internally* to a clean pass, BUT its inner loop does **NOT** re-run the 7 specialist reviewers from scratch. Per the `Conditional Inline Re-Review Protocol` in `.claude/skills/workflow-review-changes/SKILL.md`, the step-15 inline re-review re-runs only `/changes-review`'s own BE/FE/SCSS/UI dimensions plus *scoped* re-runs of the specific specialist that raised a finding — `/architecture-review`, `/performance-review`, `/security-review`, `/integration-test-review`, `/production-readiness-review`, `/domain-entities-review`, and `/ui-review` fire ONCE (steps 4–10). Only a **fresh full re-invocation** re-runs ALL specialists over the now-fixed code — catching **second-order defects the fixes themselves introduced** and killing whole-workflow confirmation bias. Without this outer loop those regressions ship unreviewed.

**Workflow:** resolve scope + Goal Contract → bind the convergence loop (protocol loop + optional `/goal` accelerator) → **round loop** { run `/workflow-review-changes` INLINE → detect fixes-applied → log iteration } → converge when a round applies zero fixes → recap.

**Key Rules:**

- **MUST run INLINE in the main session — NEVER dispatch `/workflow-review-changes` as a sub-agent.** It self-binds its own review-loop obligation (owning the session Stop hook for its `/goal` gate when available); as a sub-agent that in-session guarantee is silently lost (see the `[WORKFLOW-IN-WORKFLOW]` execution block in `workflow-review-changes/SKILL.md`). This loop skill therefore also runs inline.
- **Convergence = a whole round applied ZERO fixes** (its fix cycle, steps 12–15, was skipped because reviews passed clean). That, not "one clean review", ends the loop.
- **Scope base is FIXED across rounds; the working tree grows.** Recompute the scope each round as `branch-diff base` ∪ current uncommitted changes — the diff base never moves, so convergence is measured against a stable target.
- **Round cap (default 2, extendable ONCE to 3)** and **review-blockers-increasing → STOP & escalate** via `AskUserQuestion`. NEVER loop open-ended. Round 3 is granted only when round 2 leaves a validated CRITICAL/HIGH open (a failed non-test binary gate counts as CRITICAL), is checked before the count-based stops, never renews, and round 2 blocked by MEDIUM alone escalates instead. A failing test gate is never capped: the loop keeps fixing and re-running until the tests pass. Cap exhaustion escalates whenever fixes are still landing — CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM fixes, or edits with no review blocker open — while a zero-fix LOW-only round converges via the severity floor.
- **The severity floor bounds ITERATION, never the standard.** It ends the loop; it never authorizes shipping a known CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM, and it never applies to a binary gate inside the inner workflow (a failing test is a failure, not a LOW finding).

---

## First Principle — Convergence, Not Motion

> A round that changes files is progress **only if** the next round finds fewer things to fix.
> The loop exists to reach a fixed point (zero fixes), not to keep churning the diff.
> If findings stop shrinking, that is a signal to **escalate**, not to spin another round — except the one round-2 CRITICAL/HIGH extension, which is granted first.

---

## Step 0 — Resolve Scope + Goal Contract (FIRST ACTION)

1. **Parse the review scope** from the user prompt into a stable, reusable scope string. It has two parts UNIONed:
   - **Branch-diff base** — a branch-to-branch or PR diff, e.g. `fix/timelog-org-business-timezone` into `develop`. Capture it as `git diff develop...HEAD` (three-dot: changes on the feature branch since it forked from `develop`) so the base is a **fixed merge-base**, not a moving target.
   - **Current changes** — the uncommitted working-tree changes (`git status --porcelain`, `git diff` + `git diff --staged`).
   - **Scope string (recompute each round):** `{branch-diff base} ∪ {current uncommitted changes}`. The base commit is fixed for the whole loop; the uncommitted set legitimately grows as fixes land.
   - If the prompt names no branch diff (pure "current changes" review), the scope is just the working-tree changes — the loop still applies.
2. **Resolve/create the Goal Contract** per `SYNC:goal-contract-satisfaction-loop` (`plans/goals/{YYMMDD-HHmm}-{slug}/goal.md`, template `.claude/templates/goal-contract-template.md`). Its single **required** Success Criterion:
   > *A complete `/workflow-review-changes` run over `{scope}` applies **zero fixes** (a clean no-op pass — no `/plan-execute` file changes; **round 1** no validated findings of any severity, **round 2** no validated CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM, with remaining LOW findings deferred rather than fixed).*
   Record the round cap (default 2, extendable once to 3 on an open CRITICAL/HIGH at round 2; failing test gates uncapped until green), the severity floor (LOW non-blocking from round 2), and the scope string in **Constraints**.

## Step 0b — Bind the Convergence Loop (protocol-first; `/goal` is an optional accelerator)

The convergence loop is bound by TWO layers. The **protocol loop (Steps 1–2) is the BINDING mechanism** and MUST be self-driven by you, the running agent, on every host — with or without any command or hook. The **`/goal` command is an OPTIONAL accelerator** layered on top; it is never the primary mechanism, and its absence NEVER weakens the loop. This mirrors the project rule that hooks/trackers are accelerators only — correctness must not depend on them.

**1. Protocol loop — ALWAYS binding (hook/command-independent).** You are personally responsible for not stopping until the loop converges or bounded-escalates. This binds Claude, Codex, and Copilot equally, whether or not `/goal` exists:

> Repeatedly run `/workflow-review-changes` INLINE over `{scope}` (branch-diff base ∪ current uncommitted changes, recomputed each round). After each round, detect whether it applied any fix. From round 2 on, instruct the inner workflow to fix only CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM validated findings and to defer LOW ones. Do NOT stop while the last round still applied fixes. Converge when a full round applies ZERO fixes (reviews clean, `/plan-execute` changed no files) — which from round 2 includes a round whose only validated findings were LOW and that landed no other edit. Cap at `{N=2}` rounds, extendable ONCE to round 3 only when round 2 leaves a validated CRITICAL/HIGH open (a failed non-test binary gate counts as CRITICAL); a failing test gate is outside the cap and the no-progress rule — keep fixing and re-running until the tests pass, never forcing green; if review blockers do not shrink across 2 consecutive rounds (checked only after the round-2 CRITICAL/HIGH extension, which is granted first), or the review budget (round 2, or round 3 when extended) is spent with fixes still landing (CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM fixes, or edits with no review blocker open) → STOP and escalate via `AskUserQuestion`. Never loop open-ended.

Treat this as a standing obligation you re-read at every Step 2 checkpoint — NOT a one-time note you can rationalize away after the first round. The Goal Contract's required Success Criterion (Step 0) is its durable, host-independent record.

**2. `/goal` command — invoke as an accelerator WHEN AVAILABLE.** If a `/goal` command exists and you are permitted to run it in this environment, ALSO invoke it (a real tool/command call, NOT a paraphrase, NOT a Goal Contract file substituted for it) with the SAME condition, so a session Stop hook mechanically enforces the loop:

```
/goal review-changes convergence loop: repeatedly run /workflow-review-changes INLINE over {scope} (branch-diff base ∪ current uncommitted changes, recomputed each round). After each round, detect whether it applied any fix; if fixes>0 → run another round; if a full round applied ZERO fixes (reviews clean, /plan-execute changed no files) → CONVERGED, clear the gate. From round 2 on, the inner workflow fixes only CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM and defers LOW, so a LOW-only round that landed no other edit is a zero-fix round and CONVERGES. Do NOT stop while the last round still applied fixes. Cap at {N=2} rounds, extendable ONCE to round 3 only when round 2 leaves a validated CRITICAL/HIGH open (a failed non-test binary gate counts as CRITICAL); a failing test gate is outside the cap and the no-progress rule — keep fixing and re-running until the tests pass, never forcing green; if review blockers do not shrink across 2 consecutive rounds (checked only after the round-2 CRITICAL/HIGH extension, which is granted first), or the review budget (round 2, or round 3 when extended) is spent with fixes still landing (CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM fixes, or edits with no review blocker open) → STOP and escalate via AskUserQuestion. Never loop open-ended.
```

The `/goal` Stop hook blocks stopping until the condition holds and auto-clears when met — do not tell the user to clear it.

**If `/goal` is unavailable, unregistered, or not permitted** (e.g. Codex/Copilot, or a Claude run without the command): DO NOT error, DO NOT block, and DO NOT invent a stand-in gate. Record ONE line in the Goal Contract — `/goal accelerator unavailable — loop bound by protocol (Steps 1–2) + this Goal Contract` — and proceed. The protocol loop above plus the Goal Contract are the same gate, enforced by discipline instead of a hook.

> **Nested gates (by design, safe):** each inner `/workflow-review-changes` round self-binds its OWN Step 0 review-loop obligation (and installs its own `/goal` gate WHEN available) that clears when that round reaches its internal clean pass. This OUTER loop persists across rounds and **subsumes** the inner ones (a converged loop implies every inner round ended clean). All self-clear on satisfaction — no orphaned gate. Do NOT tell the user to clear either.

## Step 1 — Round Loop (run → detect → log)

For each round `R` (starting at 1), do ALL of:

1. **Snapshot before:** record the working-tree fingerprint — `git status --porcelain` + `git diff --stat` (or `git rev-parse` of `git stash create` for an exact hash). This is the fixes-applied baseline for the round.
2. **Run the workflow INLINE:** invoke `/workflow-review-changes` via the `Skill` tool (NEVER the `Agent` tool) with the recomputed `{scope}` as its prompt. Let it run its full 20-step sequence including its own internal fix→re-review loop.
3. **Detect fixes-applied (objective):** compare the working tree after the round to the before-snapshot AND read the workflow's own result:
   - **Fixes applied (>0)** if the working tree changed during the round OR the workflow reported its fix cycle (steps 12–15) ran / `/plan-execute` modified files.
   - **Zero fixes** if the working tree is byte-identical to the before-snapshot AND the workflow reported either no validated findings, or (round 2) validated findings that are ALL LOW with the fix phase explicitly skipped.
   - If a claimed LOW-only exit has a changed fingerprint, re-review in the next round (Step 2 row (7)); it is not a no-op convergence pass.
4. **Append an Iteration Log entry** to the Goal Contract: round number, files changed this round (`file:line`), fixes-applied count, the review verdict, and remaining gaps.

## Step 2 — Convergence & Escalation Gate

Evaluate after every round, **in this order — the first matching row decides** (rows (1), (4) and (5) are the outcomes `SYNC:double-round-trip-review` and `review-policy.cjs` enforce; the count-based stops (2) and (3) are this loop's stricter exit on top of them, evaluated after the extension so they never pre-empt it, and rows (6) and (7) are this loop's own zero-fix convergence and its zero-fix proof round; count only review blockers — validated findings at each round's own bar plus failed non-test binary gates, never failing test gates): (1) round 2 left a validated CRITICAL/HIGH review blocker open → the one extension round, even when the blocker count did not shrink; (2) review blockers increased vs the prior round → STOP & escalate; (3) review blockers are still open and did not shrink across 2 consecutive rounds → STOP & escalate (the EARLIER exit before the budget); (4) the review budget is spent with a review blocker still open (round 2 without a CRITICAL/HIGH, or round 3 and later) → STOP & escalate, even while a test gate is also red; (5) a test gate is failing and no review blocker is open → keep looping with no round cap, and never converge while it is red; (6) the round applied ZERO fixes (no review, simplifier, or `/plan-execute` edit, and from round 2 a LOW-only round applies none) and no test gate is failing → CONVERGED; (7) the round applied fixes but no review blocker is open and no test gate is failing (for example only `/code-simplifier` edited) → run the next round to prove a zero-fix pass while within budget, and STOP & escalate once the review budget is spent; (8) review blockers are open within budget and shrank (or this is round 1) → fix them and any failing test, then run the next round. A MATERIAL trade-off pauses the loop at any step before its fix lands.

| Condition | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Round applied **ZERO fixes** (clean no-op pass) AND no test gate is failing | **CONVERGED** → mark the required criterion PASS in the Goal Satisfaction matrix → clear the `/goal` gate → go to Step 3. |
| Round applied fixes AND round `< N` AND findings shrank vs prior round | Recompute `{scope}`, run round `R+1`. |
| Round applied fixes but **no review blocker is open** AND no test gate is failing (for example only `/code-simplifier` edited) | Within budget: recompute `{scope}` and run round `R+1` to prove a zero-fix pass. At a spent review budget: **STOP & escalate** via `AskUserQuestion` — never converge on edits no zero-fix pass has followed. |
| Review blockers are still open and did **not shrink** across 2 consecutive rounds (same/increasing count; failing tests excluded — they loop until green; a round-2 CRITICAL/HIGH takes the extension row first) | **STOP & escalate** via `AskUserQuestion` — a non-converging loop is a signal, not a reason to spin. |
| Round `R ≥ 2` whose validated findings are **ALL LOW** (zero CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM) AND the round applied zero fixes (no simplifier or other edit landed either) AND no test gate is failing | **CONVERGED on the severity floor** → do NOT run another round for LOW alone → record every remaining LOW as a deferred finding in the recap + Goal Contract → mark the required criterion PASS → go to Step 3. |
| Round 2 completed with a validated **CRITICAL or HIGH** still open | **ONE extension round is granted** → land the validated fixes and run round 3 (fresh full re-review), even when the blocker count did not shrink. Granted once per loop; it never renews. A failed non-test binary gate counts as CRITICAL here. |
| A **test gate** is failing (a suite that must actually pass) and no review blocker is open, at any round within or past the budget | **Keep looping — NO round cap.** Run the failed-test investigation gate, fix at the owning layer, re-run the tests, and continue past round 3 until they pass. NEVER weaken an assertion, add a skip, or relax a timeout to force green. A failing test never counts toward the no-progress escalation or the round-3 extension. |
| Round cap `N` hit with CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM fixes still landing — round 2 blocked by MEDIUM or an unresolved `NOT VERIFIABLE` alone, or round 3 (the review hard cap) blocked by any review blocker | **STOP & escalate** via `AskUserQuestion` — report the still-open findings; do not silently continue. (LOW-only at the cap converges via the severity-floor row above.) |

> **Increasing review blockers = STOP.** If round `R` surfaces MORE review blockers (validated findings at its own bar plus failed non-test binary gates) than round `R-1`, the fixes are regressing the code — STOP and escalate immediately (mirrors the **Review blockers increasing** rule under **Iteration Tracking (Conversation-Scoped)** in `workflow-review-changes/SKILL.md`), unless round 2 left a validated CRITICAL/HIGH open, which takes the one extension round first. A LOW-only round 2 has zero review blockers, so it is never an increase. Never trade one fix for two new findings across rounds.

## Step 3 — Recap

Emit a concise convergence recap: rounds run, total fixes applied per round (the shrinking sequence), the final clean-pass evidence, and the Goal Satisfaction matrix (required criterion PASS). Point to each round's report under `tmp/reports/` and the Goal Contract Iteration Log. Do NOT commit or push unless the user explicitly asks.

---

## Convergence Detection — Why Two Conditions

A round counts as converged ONLY when **both** hold: (a) the working tree is unchanged by the round, AND (b) the reviews reported clean at that round's bar — no validated findings in round 1, no validated CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM from round 2 (deferred LOWs listed, not fixed). Both are required because:

- Working-tree-unchanged alone is ambiguous — a round can make no changes because a finding was **unfixable/escalated**, not because it was clean. That is escalation, not convergence.
- Reviews-clean alone is insufficient — an orchestrator can rationalize a "clean" verdict; the objective `git`-diff comparison is the backstop that proves no fix actually landed.

When (a) is true but (b) is false → **escalate** (a real finding the loop cannot close). When (b) is true but (a) is false → the round DID fix things → run another round to re-prove clean.

---

**IMPORTANT MANDATORY sequence:** Step 0 (scope + Goal Contract) → Step 0b (bind the convergence loop: protocol loop primary + optional `/goal` accelerator) → Step 1 (round loop: run `/workflow-review-changes` INLINE → detect fixes → log) → Step 2 (converge on zero-fix round / escalate on non-progress) → Step 3 (recap).

<!-- SYNC:review-policy -->

> **Executable review policy — one predicate, one durable transition model.** Review skills and their tooling MUST use the canonical helper `.claude/scripts/lib/review-policy.cjs` (policy version 4) for round eligibility. The helper's `blockingFindings(round, findings, hardGates)` predicate returns every validated finding in round 1, and only CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM findings from round 2 onward; `NOT VERIFIABLE` is a separate unresolved-evidence state that remains blocking at every round. Failed binary gates are synthetic CRITICAL blocking findings at every round; record a test-green gate with `kind: 'test'` and every other gate with `kind: 'binary'` (the default). `evaluateRound` retains floor-round LOWs in `deferredLow`, never treats a LOW-only round as blocked after the floor applies, reports `extensionGranted` plus an `ESCALATE` status when the review budget is spent with review blockers open, and reports `failingTestGates` / `testLoopContinues` when failing test gates keep the round open. Severity is assigned before the predicate and never changed to obtain a PASS.
>
> **Round and minimum rules.** `MAX_ROUNDS` (the base budget) is 2 and `HARD_MAX_ROUNDS` is 3; both are ceilings, never targets. Round 3 is an EXTENSION, not part of the default budget: the helper grants it only when the recorded round-2 evaluation still has a validated CRITICAL or HIGH review blocker — a finding, or a failed non-test binary gate carried as synthetic CRITICAL — (`extensionGranted`), grants it at most once per run, and rejects any attempt to reach round 3 without that evidence, except the failing-test continuation below, when round 2's only blockers are failing test gates. **Failing test gates are outside the review budget:** they never earn the extension and never escalate, so while failing `kind: 'test'` gates are the ONLY blockers the helper keeps the run in `CONTINUE` and accepts the next round — past round 3 if needed — until the tests pass. A review blocker past the budget still escalates, and a round with no failing test gate never re-opens the run past its budget. A round-2 evaluation whose blockers are only MEDIUM or `NOT VERIFIABLE` ends the budget and escalates. A clean review ends once `round >= minRounds`; the default minimum is 1 and an explicit `minRounds` may not exceed the base budget of 2 — the extension is earned by evidence, never declared up front. The declaration is persisted and cannot be inferred from a round counter. A failing test-green, security-must-fix, required-artifact, or other binary gate is never waived by the severity floor.
>
> **Durable run record.** A review run MUST identify `runId`, target fingerprint, policy version, target revision, minimum/maximum rounds, completed rounds, full findings/gate evidence, interruption/resume metadata, and acceptance. Use the atomic, lock-serialized transitions in `review-policy.cjs`: `start`, `record`, `accept`, `interrupt`, `resume`, `invalidate`, and `check`. Repeating an identical completed round is idempotent and MUST NOT consume budget twice. A changed target fingerprint invalidates prior evidence and acceptance but MUST preserve the bounded round budget; stale evidence cannot be accepted. A policy-version change (including the round-2 LOW floor and the conditional round-3 extension) invalidates old records; start a new run rather than interpreting old evidence under new semantics. Interrupted/resumed runs retain completed rounds and findings. The record is bookkeeping, not consent, native permission, or proof that a host actually performed the review.
>
> **CLI boundary.** The helper CLI accepts JSON on stdin and uses its own real clock; a supplied `now` is rejected. State directories must be absolute, non-root real directories, records are size-bounded, and malformed/locked state fails closed for the transition. Full reports remain on disk; an inline result envelope is only a transport summary. Any new review policy consumer must add a semantic fixture, boundary counter-cases, a seeded mutant, and a report with the target fingerprint and command exit status.

When you are running in such a context, the obligation is **redirected, never waived** — do ALL of: (a) complete questions 1 and 2 normally; (b) decide materiality and record it in the Trade-Off Assessment row with `confirmed? = NO — cannot ask from this context`; (c) **name the unconfirmed MATERIAL trade-off explicitly in your returned summary/verdict so the CALLER (or parent orchestrator) escalates it via `AskUserQuestion` on your behalf** — a material trade-off mentioned only inside a report file on disk is NOT a handoff; (d) do not emit an unqualified PASS — mark the verdict as carrying an unconfirmed material trade-off, so the caller's gate stays closed until the user answers. The caller inherits the escalation duty the moment it reads your return.
>
> This carve-out is about **reachability, not convenience**: it applies ONLY where the tool genuinely cannot reach the user (spawned sub-agent, terminal validate/verdict-only mode, non-interactive/headless run). It is NEVER a licence to skip the question, to self-approve a one-way door, or to downgrade materiality because asking is inconvenient — if you CAN ask, you MUST ask.
>
> **Emit a Trade-Off Assessment row** per reviewed decision and per recommendation: `| decision | sacrifices | gain (metric) | who pays, when | WORTH IT/NOT/UNCLEAR | material? | confirmed? |`.
>
> **BLOCKED until:** trade-off named (or dimensions-checked justification given) · worth-it verdict emitted · materiality decided · every MATERIAL trade-off either confirmed with the user OR — in a non-asking context — handed off in the returned verdict for the caller to confirm. A MATERIAL trade-off that is neither confirmed nor handed off can NEVER be PASS, and NEVER gets buried as a Low-severity note.
>
> **NEVER** answer "no trade-off" without checking · decide a material trade-off silently on the user's behalf · let convergence/delivery pressure authorize walking through a one-way door · bundle several material trade-offs into one vague "proceed?".

> **Project Protocol Overlay** — Before executing this skill, resolve any PROJECT overlay rules layered onto it: match this skill's name against the `Target` column of the project's skill-protocol index (`docs/project-reference/skill-protocols-reference.md` by default; a `referenceDocs` entry in `docs/project-config.json` overrides the path), taking the most specific matching tier ONLY — exact name > glob > `*`. **That precedence orders overlays against EACH OTHER, never against this skill.** Read ONLY the matched bodies, resolved as `<protocols-dir>/<Name>.md`; a row's Body link is display text, never a read path. A matched body that is missing or malformed is REPORTED and skipped — never reconstructed from the index Description. No index, or no match -> proceed with no overlay, silently. Full contract: `.claude/skills/project-skill-protocol/references/registry.md`.
>
> Overlays are **ADDITIVE ONLY**: they ADD rules on top of this skill's own protocol and NEVER replace, override, disable, or reinterpret a rule it already states — removing every overlay must return this skill to exactly its documented behavior. An overlay is a BRIEF, not an authority escalation: it can NEVER waive a workflow gate, git discipline, a review gate, or a user-confirmation gate. A genuine overlay-vs-skill conflict, or two equally-specific overlays that directly contradict -> surface both to the user; NEVER resolve silently.

<!-- SYNC:severity-rubric -->

> **Severity Rubric** — Classify every finding by consequence, not by effort, reviewer preference, or how annoying the fix is. One scale applies to every review, skill, agent, workflow, and host so a tier has the same meaning everywhere. Choose the highest credible consequence supported by evidence; do not lower a tier to make a round pass.
>
> **Finding vs observation (required):** An observation becomes a finding only when it names the affected user/system/data/contract, the shipped consequence, the evidence location, and the normalized tier. `INFO`, advice, preference, duplicate wording, or an unsubstantiated concern is not a finding and must not reopen a loop. If the concern might affect a required behavior or gate but evidence is incomplete, emit `NOT VERIFIABLE` with the missing evidence and keep it unresolved; never silently convert uncertainty into LOW.
>
> | Severity | Action | Definition and examples |
> | --- | --- | --- |
> | CRITICAL | Block immediately; escalate | Immediate material risk if shipped: authentication/authorization or safety bypass; secrets/PII exposure; irreversible destructive action; data loss/corruption; or a silent failure on a critical path. A failed binary gate that makes the result untrustworthy is represented as a separate synthetic blocker by the executable policy (not as an ordinary severity judgment). |
> | HIGH | Must fix before PASS/merge | Material correctness or contract risk: wrong behavior on a supported path; violated business/data invariant; meaningful privacy or authority gap; breaking API/schema/compatibility change; likely harm to users/downstream systems; or a missing proof for a behavior-changing fix. |
> | MEDIUM | Must clear the current round; escalate if the fix needs an owner decision | Bounded but consequential risk: an edge case, resilience/observability/testability/maintainability gap, credible future defect, or local architectural drift whose impact is real but not immediate material loss. An explicit follow-up records the escalation/residual risk; it does not make an open MEDIUM a clean pass. |
> | LOW | Record and defer; never open another fix/re-review round from round 2 onward, and never counts toward the round-3 extension | Non-blocking polish with no credible present correctness, security, privacy, authority, availability, or data-integrity impact: wording/formatting, minor documentation or convention drift, optional defensive cleanup, or a cosmetic/refinement suggestion. |
>
> **Consequence decision tree (apply in order):** (1) Is a binary gate failed? Keep it as a separate hard blocker (the executable helper represents it as synthetic CRITICAL); do not use the ordinary severity label to hide what failed. Otherwise, would shipping permit immediate material security/safety/authority harm, irreversible destruction, data loss/corruption, or a critical-path silent failure? → **CRITICAL**. (2) Otherwise, does a supported path, invariant, public contract, privacy/authority boundary, compatibility promise, or behavior-changing proof fail with material user/downstream impact? → **HIGH**. (3) Otherwise, is there a bounded but consequential edge, resilience, observability, testability, maintainability, or architectural gap with a credible impact? → **MEDIUM**. (4) Otherwise, is the evidence sufficient to show only non-blocking polish with no credible present material impact? → **LOW**. (5) If the evidence needed to choose between steps 1–4 is missing, → **NOT VERIFIABLE**, not LOW. When multiple tiers fit, select the highest credible consequence; effort, implementation cost, reviewer discomfort, frequency alone, proximity to the round cap, and whether a tier would unlock or forfeit the conditional round-3 extension never decide the tier.
>
> **Boundary examples (normalize before applying the round predicate):** an auth bypass, exposed secret/PII, destructive command without an authority gate, or failed required test/generation/parity gate is **CRITICAL**; a wrong supported response, broken invariant/API/schema, meaningful privacy/authority defect, or unproven behavior-changing fix is **HIGH**; a bounded retry/timeout/alert/testability gap or credible maintainability drift is **MEDIUM**; a typo, formatting inconsistency, optional cleanup, or cosmetic suggestion proven not to affect present behavior is **LOW**. A missing fact about any of those boundaries is **NOT VERIFIABLE** until evidence or an explicitly documented residual-risk decision exists.
>
> **Classification procedure (required for every finding):** (1) state the affected user, system, data, contract, or gate; (2) assess consequence if the issue ships; (3) assess exposure/likelihood and reversibility/detectability; (4) select the highest tier justified by those facts; (5) cite `file:line` or equivalent evidence and a confidence percentage. Effort, implementation cost, reviewer discomfort, and proximity to the round cap are never severity inputs. `NOT VERIFIABLE` is a pending evidence state, not one of the four tiers and never a LOW escape hatch: if the unresolved claim could affect required behavior, security, privacy, authority, availability, data integrity, or a binary gate, it remains an open evidence blocker until resolved or explicitly owner-accepted with documented residual risk. Classify an item LOW only when evidence supports the absence of credible present material impact.
>
> **Hard-gate rule:** Binary gates (tests, required artifacts, security must-fix checks, generated parity, policy compliance) are not ordinary severity-rated findings. The executable helper records a failed gate as a synthetic CRITICAL blocker solely so one predicate can carry it; the report must still name the gate and failure evidence. A failed gate blocks at every round, including when all ordinary findings are LOW; never disguise a failed gate as LOW. A failed non-test gate counts as CRITICAL for the round-3 extension; a failing test gate is outside the round budget and loops until the tests pass.
>
> **Score-based skills** map their numeric scale onto these tiers — do not invent a parallel vocabulary:
>
> - **0-2 criterion scoring** (e.g. production-readiness-review): `0` = CRITICAL/HIGH (criterion unmet, blocks readiness), `1` = MEDIUM (partial, consequential gap), `2` = pass (no finding). If the criterion is only polish, use LOW rather than forcing a `0`.
> - **Two-axis scoring** (e.g. performance-review, impact × likelihood): high impact + high exposure → CRITICAL/HIGH; material impact with bounded exposure → HIGH/MEDIUM; low impact and low exposure → LOW. Record the axes and why the selected tier is the highest credible consequence.
> - **Scorecards / `/20` grades** (e.g. architecture-scalability-review): the aggregate score and verdict band are separate from finding severity. A sub-80 area is evidence to investigate, not an automatic CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW label; classify each underlying gap by the consequence decision tree and keep advisory score deductions separate from blocking findings.
>
> **Domain-vocabulary normalization (mandatory):** Specialized skills may keep a local reporting vocabulary, but it MUST feed this same four-tier round predicate — never a second severity system:
>
> - `BLOCKED`, `HARD FAIL`, or `FAIL` is a blocking local verdict, not an automatic CRITICAL label. Classify the underlying consequence as CRITICAL when it is an immediate material risk or failed binary gate; otherwise classify it as HIGH or MEDIUM with evidence, while preserving the local block until the owning gate is satisfied.
> - `WARN` is not permission to ignore a finding. Map it to MEDIUM when the gap is consequential, to LOW only when evidence supports no credible present material impact, or upward to HIGH/CRITICAL when the consequence warrants it. `PASS`/compliant is not a finding.
> - UI `P0`/`P1`/`P2`/`P3`/`P4` map to CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW/LOW respectively as a starting point; override upward only when the evidence shows a higher shipped consequence. A P0/P1 accessibility or task-completion floor remains a blocking gate even when a local UI report calls it a priority rather than a severity.
> - Numeric SRE/readiness or impact/likelihood scores are evidence inputs, not replacement tiers. Emit the score, the consequence, and the normalized CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW tier together. `INFO`/advisory observations are not findings unless the evidence shows a material consequence.
>
> A finding's tier drives the gate: CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM remain actionable and blocking under the round policy, and only an open CRITICAL/HIGH at round 2 (a failed non-test binary gate counts as CRITICAL) unlocks the single conditional extension round; LOW may be tracked as a follow-up and, from round 2, does not by itself justify another fix/re-review. An owner decision may explain or schedule an open MEDIUM but does not turn it into a clean pass; owner acceptance never makes a failed binary gate pass and must record scope, rationale, and residual risk.

<!-- SYNC:goal-contract-satisfaction-loop:reminder -->

- **MANDATORY** Resolve the active Goal Contract BEFORE work (active plan `goal.md` → `plans/goals/{YYMMDD-HHmm}-{slug}/goal.md` → create from current request) and read saved success criteria before editing.
- **MANDATORY** Append iteration evidence after execution; emit a Goal Satisfaction matrix (PASS/FAIL/BLOCKED) before reporting PASS; loop on validated FAIL; escalate repeated no-progress or blockers. NEVER store secrets in goal files.

- **MANDATORY MUST ATTENTION ALWAYS ASK THE 3 TRADE-OFF QUESTIONS** — on the thing under review AND on every recommendation you make: (1) **is there any trade-off?** name what it SACRIFICES (change cost · complexity · perf · coupling · reversibility · migration · ops load · blast radius · security · testability · delivery time · UX) — "none"/"pure win" is an unfinished analysis, so state the dimensions checked; (2) **is it worth it?** gain (with a metric) vs cost, WHO pays, WHEN → emit **WORTH IT / NOT WORTH IT / UNCLEAR**; NOT WORTH IT → withdraw or replace it; (3) **is it material enough to confirm with the user?** irreversible/one-way door · cost shifted onto another team/ops/maintainer/user · one quality attribute traded for another · a tier/service/event/library boundary crossed · auth/money/data-integrity/breaking-change/High-or-Medium-risk path · verdict UNCLEAR → **STOP and confirm via `AskUserQuestion` BEFORE the verdict**.
- **MANDATORY** A MATERIAL trade-off with no user confirmation can NEVER be PASS; NEVER bury one as a Low-severity note, NEVER decide it silently, and NEVER let delivery or convergence pressure authorize a one-way door. — why: an un-walked-back one-way door is the user's call to make, not the reviewer's.
- **MANDATORY — non-asking contexts escalate BY HANDOFF, never by silence.** `AskUserQuestion` reaches only the main interactive agent: a sub-agent cannot ask the user, and a terminal/verdict-only mode asks nothing by design. There the duty is REDIRECTED, not waived — still name the trade-off, still decide materiality, record `confirmed? = NO — cannot ask from this context`, **state the unconfirmed MATERIAL trade-off in your RETURNED verdict/summary so the CALLER escalates it** (a note only in an on-disk report is not a handoff), and never emit an unqualified PASS. Applies ONLY where the user is genuinely unreachable (spawned sub-agent, terminal validate mode, headless run) — if you CAN ask, you MUST ask.

> **Review Applicability / Current-Principles Awareness** — Every review must first classify the change context (greenfield foundation, brownfield feature/refactor, test/docs/config/UI/infra, or actor-facing/machine surface) and take notice of the applicable current principles below. This is an evidence-gated applicability check, not a mandate to flag or build every item.
>
> **Detailed protocol routing — read/apply only when warranted:**
> - `SYNC:scale-ready-foundation` — greenfield foundation is blocking; big-feature brownfield fit/adapt/defer; architecture review is advisory when auditing. Detailed carriers: `workflow-greenfield-init`, `workflow-big-feature`.
> - `SYNC:test-architecture-execution-contract` — assertion-bearing tests use explicit `Given` → `When` → `Then`, name the guarded intent/technical contract, and assert an owned outcome. Detailed carriers: `integration-test`, `workflow-greenfield-init`, and the test-architecture review path.
> - `SYNC:ai-agent-as-user-access` — when an AI/machine actor or future contract is evidenced, inspect identity/delegation, capability boundaries, selected API/CLI/MCP/WebMCP/event/SDK surface, safety/consent, audit/observability, and GWT contract tests. Detailed carriers: `workflow-greenfield-init`, `workflow-big-feature`, `architecture-review`.
> - `SYNC:design-system-check` — when UI changes, inspect the design-system and component-contract obligations; route visual/UX depth to the owning UI review.
>
> **Review behavior:** Check only principles applicable to the reviewed scope; record `APPLY-NOW`, `ADAPT-IN-SLICE`, `DEFER-AS-OPPORTUNITY`, `NOT-APPLICABLE`, `BLOCKED`, or `UNVERIFIED` with `file:line`/config/CI evidence, status/severity, owner/route, and next step/revisit trigger. Do not invent findings from a generic checklist, flag unrelated pre-existing gaps as regressions, silently expand the requested scope, or mutate a parent gate merely because advice exists.
>
> **Ownership:** `changes-review` coordinates the applicability pass and routes depth to the owning specialist (`architecture-review`, `integration-test-review`, `security-review`, `performance-review`, `ui-review`, `production-readiness-review`, or another matching review). A specialist reports its own lens and does not duplicate or override another review's verdict; existing brownfield gaps stay advisory unless new, safety-relevant, or explicitly in scope.
>
> **Required review note:** `context/scope | principle/protocol checked | evidence | status/verdict | severity | owner/route | next step/revisit trigger`.
>
> **BLOCKED when:** an applicable principle is required for safety/correctness but missing, unowned, or untestable. Otherwise record an evidence-backed `NOT-APPLICABLE`, advisory, `DEFER-AS-OPPORTUNITY`, or `UNVERIFIED` result according to the lifecycle and change context; creating a greenfield foundation remains subject to its own blocking protocol.

## Closing Reminders

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION Goal:** Re-run the WHOLE `/workflow-review-changes` inline, round after round, over a fixed scope ∪ accumulated fixes, until a complete round applies **zero fixes**.

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION main steps (in order):** (0) resolve scope + Goal Contract → (0b) bind the convergence loop (protocol loop primary + optional `/goal` accelerator) → (1) round loop: run `/workflow-review-changes` INLINE → detect fixes-applied → append Iteration Log → (2) converge on a zero-fix round / escalate on non-progress → (3) recap.

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION [BLOCKING] plan the detailed todo tasks FIRST — before running the loop.** Before the first round, create a detailed todo-task plan that enumerates every planned step and every planned round; a round MUST NOT start until that round's fresh todo-task plan exists. On EVERY re-run (each new round), REGENERATE a fresh loop todo-task plan — NEVER reuse the prior round's task list — so each round's work is explicitly planned before it executes.

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** the convergence loop is bound by the **AI-driven protocol loop (Steps 1–2) — that is the primary, host-independent mechanism you MUST self-drive whether or not any command exists.** The `/goal` command is an OPTIONAL accelerator: invoke it (a real call) ONLY when available and permitted; if it is absent/unregistered/not-permitted, record one line in the Goal Contract and proceed — NEVER error, block, or fake a gate. Correctness must not depend on `/goal`.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** run `/workflow-review-changes` **INLINE via the `Skill` tool — NEVER as a sub-agent** (it self-binds its own review-loop obligation + a session `/goal` gate when available).
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** convergence = a whole round applied **ZERO fixes** (fix cycle skipped, working tree unchanged, reviews clean at that round's bar) — not merely one clean review. **From round 2 the severity floor applies: LOW findings are deferred not fixed, so a LOW-only round that landed no other edit is a zero-fix round and ENDS the loop.**
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** the outer loop's value is the **fresh full specialist sweep** the inner loop never re-runs (see the **Conditional Inline Re-Review Protocol** in `workflow-review-changes/SKILL.md`) — that is why this skill exists.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** keep the diff **base fixed** across rounds; recompute `{scope}` = branch-diff base ∪ current uncommitted changes each round.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** enforce the **round cap (default 2, extendable ONCE to round 3 when round 2 leaves a validated CRITICAL/HIGH open)**; review blockers not shrinking across 2 rounds (checked only after the round-2 CRITICAL/HIGH extension, which is granted first), or the budget spent with fixes still landing (CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM fixes, or edits with no review blocker open) → **STOP & escalate** via `AskUserQuestion`. NEVER loop past round 3 on review blockers, or open-ended — only failing test gates continue, until green.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** do NOT commit or push unless the user explicitly asks.
