## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Create or run database migrations following the repository's documented patterns.

**Workflow:**

1. **Identify** — Determine migration type (schema migration vs data/document migration)
2. **Create** — Generate migration using the configured migration tool or data migration executor (see backend-patterns-reference.md under the reference-docs root, default docs/project-reference, overridable via docsRoots.projectReference.path in docs/project-config.json)
3. **Verify** — Run migration and confirm schema/data changes

**Key Rules:**

- Follow the repository's migration patterns (see CLAUDE.md / project-reference docs)
- For CREATE: present the migration design and wait for explicit user approval before creating migration files
- Always backup data before destructive migrations
- Use the configured data migration executor for data/document migrations (see backend-patterns-reference.md under the reference-docs root, default docs/project-reference, overridable via docsRoots.projectReference.path in docs/project-config.json)

**Be skeptical. Apply critical thinking, sequential thinking. Every claim needs traced proof, confidence percentages (Idea should be more than 80%).**

Database migration: $ARGUMENTS

## Instructions

1. **Parse arguments**:
    - `add <name>` → Create new schema/data migration with the configured tool
    - `update` → Apply pending migrations
    - `list` → List all migrations and status
    - `rollback` → Revert last migration
    - No argument → Show migration status

2. **Identify database provider + migration tooling** from project config and project-reference docs:
    - Relational stores: managed by the configured schema-migration tool.
    - Document/key-value/event stores: may use code-based migrations or startup executors defined by the repository.

3. **For schema migrations**:

Add migration:

    ```bash
    {configured-migration-add-command} <MigrationName>
    ```

Update database:

    ```bash
    {configured-migration-update-command}
    ```

List migrations:

    ```bash
    {configured-migration-list-command}
    ```

4. **For data/document migrations**:
    - Often code-based migrations run by the configured migration executor (see backend-patterns-reference.md under the reference-docs root, default docs/project-reference, overridable via docsRoots.projectReference.path in docs/project-config.json)
    - Location: the repository's configured migration folder — discover from `backend-patterns-reference.md` under that same reference-docs root (`docsRoots.projectReference.path` in `docs/project-config.json`)
    - Migrations run automatically on application startup
    - To create: Generate new migration class following existing patterns

5. **Safety checks**:
    - Warn before applying migrations to production
    - Show what changes will be applied
    - Recommend backup before destructive operations

6. **Migration Safety Review (MANDATORY for non-local environments)**:
    - Before applying to staging/production, spawn `database-admin` sub-agent (`subagent_type: "database-admin"`) for safety review
    - Review criteria: locking behavior on large tables, index creation impact under concurrent writes, rollback strategy, zero-downtime feasibility
    - Present findings and get explicit user approval before running the configured migration apply command on non-local environments

## Sub-Agent Type Override

> **MANDATORY for non-local migration apply:** Spawn `database-admin` sub-agent (`subagent_type: "database-admin"`) for safety review BEFORE applying to staging or production.
> **Rationale:** `database-admin` specializes in query plans, index impact analysis, locking behavior, backup/restore, and replication — context the main agent lacks for production-safe migration decisions.

---

> **[IMPORTANT]** Use `TaskCreate` to break ALL work into small tasks BEFORE starting — including tasks for each file read. This prevents context loss from long files. For simple tasks, AI MUST ATTENTION ask user whether to skip.

**Prerequisites:** **MUST ATTENTION READ** before executing:

- `domain-entities-reference.md` under the reference-docs root (default `docs/project-reference`; `docsRoots.projectReference.path` in `docs/project-config.json` overrides) — Domain entity catalog, relationships, cross-service sync (read when task involves business entities/models)

<!-- SYNC:source-test-drift-check -->

> **Source/test drift check.** For coding, fix, debug, investigation, test, or review work: when source behavior changes, inspect affected unit/integration/E2E tests and decide from evidence whether tests should change to match intended behavior or the source change is an unintended bug to fix. Do not write tests for migration code; schema/data migrations are one-time execution paths, not core application logic.

<!-- SYNC:ai-mistake-prevention -->

> **AI Mistake Prevention** — Failure modes to avoid on every task:
>
> **Project applicability gate.** Before applying a stack, layer, style, tool, or architecture rule, read the project's config and relevant references, then check local implementations. Treat framework examples as examples; honor explicit N/A and do not require a technology or convention the project does not use.
> **ROOT-CAUSE GATE — INVESTIGATE FIRST.** Before applying any project-related correction, always use the project's root-cause investigation protocol and establish the cause; the failure site may be only a symptom.
> **FAILED-TEST GATE.** For any failed or unstable test, use the project's test-investigation protocol before editing source or tests; never change either side merely to force green.
> **Re-read files after context changes.** Context compaction, resume, or long-running work can make memory stale; verify current files before acting.
> **Verify generated content against source evidence.** AI hallucinates APIs, names, claims, and document facts. Check the relevant source before documenting or referencing.
> **Check downstream references before deleting or renaming.** Removing an artifact can stale docs, generated mirrors, configs, and callers; map references first.
> **Trace the full impact chain after edits.** Changing a definition can miss derived outputs and consumers. Follow the affected chain before declaring done.
> **Verify ALL affected outputs, not just the first.** One green check is not all green checks; validate every output surface the change can affect.
> **Assume existing values are intentional — ask WHY before changing OR flagging one as a defect.** Before changing or reporting a constant, limit, flag, cutoff, wording, or pattern, read nearby context and history, the CALLER's ordering, and 2+ sibling call sites of the same convention. A doc stating WHAT without WHY is missing rationale, not proof of a missing guard.
> **Surface ambiguity before acting — don't pick silently.** Multiple valid interpretations require an explicit question or stated assumption with risk.
> **Assert the outcome your system owns, not the intermediate state your infrastructure owns.** When verifying async work, assert the final business state — never the delivery/retry bookkeeping held in shared infrastructure that any co-running process can write. Such a check passes when run alone and flakes the moment anything else shares that infrastructure.
> **Store disposable generated output in the project workspace.** If an output can be regenerated and is not source code, a canonical source-of-truth, or an intentionally versioned projection, write it under the project-root `tmp/` or `temp/` directory (prefer `tmp/`), scoped to the run. This includes temporary state, integration/E2E results, reports, logs, screenshots, traces, videos, coverage, dumps, and candidate evidence. Never put these outputs in source, docs, the plans root (default `plans/`; a `docsRoots.plans.path` entry in `docs/project-config.json` overrides the path), the team-artifacts root (default `team-artifacts/`; `docsRoots.teamArtifacts.path` in the same config overrides the path), or mirror directories; the project-root `.gitignore` must ignore `/tmp/` and `/temp/` by default. Committed fixtures, accepted baselines, canonical specs/docs, and explicitly versioned generated mirrors remain at their declared owner paths.
> **Judge the environment before judging the code.** A bug report, failed test, error, or unexpected output is not proof of a code defect. Before and during adjudication, weigh environment causes as a competing hypothesis — setup, config, version and dependency state, service dependencies, stale artifacts or leftover state, and transient resource pressure (RAM, CPU, disk, handles, network). State the discriminator you ran; fix an environment cause in the environment, never by editing product code or weakening a test to absorb it.
> **Keep shared guidance role-relevant.** Universal guidance must help every receiving skill or agent; code-specific obligations belong only in code-specific protocols.

<!-- SYNC:sub-agent-selection -->

> **Sub-Agent Selection** — Full routing contract: `.claude/skills/shared/sub-agent-selection-guide.md`
> **Rule:** Route specialized domains (architecture, security, performance, DB, E2E, integration-test, git) to the matching specialist agent (see guide above) — NEVER use `code-reviewer` for these. — why: `code-reviewer` lacks each domain's checklist, so specialized issues slip through.

<!-- SYNC:nested-task-creation -->

> **Nested Task Expansion Contract** — For workflow-step invocation, the `[Workflow] ...` row is only a parent container; the child skill still creates visible phase tasks.
>
> 1. Call `TaskList` first. If a matching active parent workflow row exists, set `nested=true` and record `parentTaskId`; otherwise run standalone.
> 2. Create one task per declared phase before phase work. When nested, prefix subjects `[N.M] /skill-name — phase`.
> 3. When nested, link the parent with `TaskUpdate(parentTaskId, addBlockedBy: [childIds])`.
> 4. Orchestrators must pre-expand a child skill's phase list and link the workflow row before invoking that child skill or sub-agent.
> 5. Mark exactly one child `in_progress` before work and `completed` immediately after evidence is written.
> 6. Complete the parent only after all child tasks are completed or explicitly cancelled with reason.
>
> **Blocked until:** `TaskList` done, child phases created, parent linked when nested, first child marked `in_progress`.

<!-- /SYNC:nested-task-creation -->

<!-- SYNC:project-reference-docs-guide -->

> **Project Reference Docs Gate (static JIT)** — Run after task-tracking bootstrap, immediately before target/source reads, grep, edits, tests, or analysis. Project docs override generic framework assumptions; hooks may remind or accelerate this gate but never prove it ran.
>
> 1. **Scope** — identify file types, domain area, and operation.
> 2. **Project config is OPTIONAL.** Read the configured project-config file via its loader (default `docs/project-config.json`) when it exists. Absent is a supported state, not an error: run on portable defaults, derive project facts (paths, commands, conventions, architecture, test/spec layout) from repository evidence (manifests, lockfiles, scripts, CI, layout, root instruction files), state material assumptions, never block, and at most OFFER `/project-init` or `/project-config` once. Present → minimum valid shape is a non-empty `project.name`; omitted optional capabilities use neutral defaults or skip. A DECLARED section left malformed or incomplete is a configuration error: fail closed on it and run `/project-init` or `/project-config` before relying on it — why: silent defaults would present wrong facts as authoritative. Verify material config hints against repository evidence; generic defaults are never project facts.
> 3. **Select docs.** Always-on: the project-init-owned `lessons.md` and docs-index inputs at their configured owner paths — read independently, never appended to `referenceDocs`. Task-specific: an explicit `referenceDocs` array is the exact selection, subsets and `[]` included; absent → the runtime capability-aware resolver (portable baseline plus configuration- or repository-evidenced capabilities; may be empty). The scan-target manifest is a registry, not a default selection. Filenames resolve under the reference-docs root (default `docs/project-reference`; `docsRoots.projectReference.path` in `docs/project-config.json` overrides it). Custom-doc schema, ownership, and path-safety rules: `.claude/skills/scan/references/targets.md`.
> 4. **Route by phase.** Just in time, read the selected docs the table names for the phase you are ABOUT to enter, plus any selected custom doc whose `purpose` covers that phase. An unmatched row is `Not applicable`, never a blocker.
>
> | About to… | Read first (when selected and present) |
> | --- | --- |
> | investigate, explain, plan, design, estimate | `project-structure-reference.md`, `domain-entities-reference.md`, plus the edit-row docs for every file type the plan will touch |
> | edit or write code | `code-review-rules.md`, plus server-side / non-UI code → `backend-patterns-reference.md`; UI → `frontend-patterns-reference.md`, `scss-styling-guide.md`, `design-system/README.md` |
> | write, run, fix, or review tests or test data | the matching kind: `integration-test-reference.md` · `e2e-test-reference.md` · `seed-test-data-reference.md` |
> | author or change specs, test cases, or docs | `feature-spec-reference.md`, `spec-system-reference.md`, `spec-principles.md`; `workflow-spec-test-code-cycle-reference.md` when specs, tests, and code must stay in sync |
> | review a diff, plan, spec, or artifact | `code-review-rules.md`, plus the edit/test/spec-row docs for every file type under review |
>
> 5. **Per-file conventions** (`contextGroups[]` in the project config) add rules for the exact file read or edited: hooks deliver them where they run; elsewhere run `node .claude/hooks/lib/file-conventions.cjs --lookup <path>` before the first edit of an unfamiliar path class.
> 6. **Cite and repair.** State `Reference docs read: ... | Not applicable: ...` (record an explicit empty selection); still honor references the active skill or task requires. A missing/stale always-on input or selected/required doc, or a malformed declared config section → `/project-init` or the narrow owner route (`/project-config`, `/docs-init`, `/scan --target=<key>`, `/ai-context-refresh`) before relying on it.
> 7. **Dedup within ~200K tokens.** A doc counts as loaded only when its full content came back to THIS context from your own read, after the last compaction and within roughly the last 200K tokens, and it has not changed since — list it in `Reference docs read:` as `<doc> (loaded)` and skip the re-read. Everything else is not loaded: a hook reminder, a summary, a doc merely named in the conversation, or a read by another agent. Re-select and re-read after compaction, resume, a material context change, or ~200K tokens of growth (= the file-convention hook default). A delegated sub-agent starts empty: name the resolved doc paths in its brief.
>
> **Ready when:** scope set · config read or its absence recorded · always-on inputs confirmed · selection applied (may be empty) · phase docs read or cited `(loaded)` · citation emitted.

> 2. Read the target area and its configured project references; identify actual structure, owners, and conventions without assuming a framework, layer model, or base class.
> 3. Run `python .claude/scripts/code_graph trace <file> --direction both --json` when `.code-graph/graph.db` exists and the task concerns code relationships.
> 4. Map affected dependencies and callers with available repository tools; do not block on an absent graph or unsupported tool.
> 5. Write investigation to `tmp/analysis/` for non-trivial tasks (3+ files).

- **MANDATORY** Project config is OPTIONAL (default `docs/project-config.json`, via its loader): absent → portable defaults plus repository evidence, state material assumptions, never block; present → non-empty `project.name`, neutral defaults for omitted capabilities, fail closed on a declared malformed section.
- **MANDATORY** An explicit `referenceDocs` array is exact, including `[]`; absent → only the capability-aware resolver output, which may be empty. `lessons.md` and docs-index are always-on, outside that selection.

- **MANDATORY** Pick docs by the phase you are about to enter — plan/investigate, edit code, tests, specs/docs, review — from the gate's routing table, JUST IN TIME before the first target read/grep/edit/test, plus the file's `contextGroups[]` conventions before editing it; cite `Reference docs read: ...`.
- **MANDATORY** Dedup: skip a re-read only for your own full read after the last compaction, within ~200K tokens, unchanged since — a hook reminder, summary, or prior mention is NEVER evidence; re-read after compaction or resume, and give delegated sub-agents the resolved doc paths.

## Prompt-Enhance Closing Anchors

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** follow declared step order for this skill; NEVER skip, reorder, or merge steps without explicit user approval
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** for every step/sub-skill call: set `in_progress` before execution, set `completed` after execution
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** every skipped step MUST include explicit reason; every completed step MUST include concise evidence
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** if Task tools unavailable, maintain an equivalent step-by-step plan tracker with synchronized statuses

<!-- PROMPT-ENHANCE:STEP-TASK-CLOSING:END -->

<!-- SYNC:parallel-subagent-dispatch -->

> **Parallel Sub-Agent Dispatch** — Plan parallelism the moment a task breakdown exists, BEFORE executing it — running provably independent tasks sequentially wastes wall-clock. Applies to every multi-step job: workflow steps, planning, batch updates, investigation, research, scans, reviews, doc sync. **Plan execution is metadata-gated, NEVER default-parallel** — fan-out follows ONLY what the plan declares (`PAR`/`SEQ` tags + per-phase write set); an untagged plan runs sequentially — why: a derived write set cannot see cascade or generated writes.
>
> 1. **Tag every task `PAR` or `SEQ`.** `PAR` = inputs exclude every pending task's output AND write set disjoint from every other `PAR`. Else `SEQ` — MUST ATTENTION name the dependency forcing it.
> 2. **Group `PAR` into waves.** No edge between members. Two writers of one file NEVER share a wave. Read-only work (search, investigation, review, research) parallelizes freely.
> 3. **Declare before dispatch:** `Parallel plan: wave 1 = [...] · wave 2 = [...] · SEQ = [...] (reason)`.
> 4. **Spawn each wave in ONE message** — every `Agent` call in one response, NEVER dripped per turn. Route each task to its specialist (`.claude/skills/shared/sub-agent-selection-guide.md`); NEVER `code-reviewer` as catch-all.
> 5. **Brief each sub-agent self-contained:** goal · scope + owned files · reference docs · return contract (summary + `Full report:` path, per SYNC:subagent-return-contract) · incremental persistence to `tmp/reports/` (per SYNC:incremental-persistence).
> 6. **Barrier per wave.** Advance ONLY after EVERY member returns (a skipped conditional counts as returned). Merge, mark each task completed/skipped, THEN dispatch the next wave. Mutating steps wait for the barrier.
> 7. **One level deep.** A dispatched sub-agent executes its own brief; further fan-out stays the orchestrator's job unless that agent's `.claude/agents/*.md` definition authorizes it.
>
> **NEVER parallelize:** tasks sharing a write target · a task consuming a pending task's output · trivial single-file work (dispatch overhead > gain) · an order a skill or workflow explicitly fixes · gates awaiting user approval.
>
> **Blocked until:** MUST ATTENTION every task tagged PAR/SEQ with a named reason per SEQ · waves declared + write-set disjointness checked · each wave spawned in ONE message · barrier honored before the next wave.

<!-- /SYNC:parallel-subagent-dispatch -->

<!-- SYNC:parallel-subagent-dispatch:reminder -->

- **MANDATORY** After planning tasks, tag each PAR/SEQ and spawn every PAR wave as parallel sub-agents in ONE message — default parallel for workflows, batch updates, investigation, research, reviews; plan execution fans out ONLY on what the plan declares.
- **MANDATORY** Disjoint write sets per wave · all-return barrier before the next wave · specialist routing · sub-agents NEVER fan out further unless their own agent definition authorizes it.

<!-- /SYNC:parallel-subagent-dispatch:reminder -->

<!-- SYNC:project-protocol-overlay -->

> **Project Protocol Overlay** — Before executing this skill, resolve project overlays from the index at `<docsRoots.projectReference.path>/skill-protocols-reference.md` (default `docs/project-reference/`; `docsRoots.projectReference.path` in `docs/project-config.json` overrides it). A matching `referenceDocs[]` filename may relocate the index within that root; this registry is independent from task-specific reference-doc selection, so omitted or empty `referenceDocs` does not disable it. The index's `**Protocols directory:**` header selects a project-root-relative body directory (default `docs/project-protocols/`). Match this skill against the `Target` column and take the most specific tier ONLY — exact name > glob > `*`. **That precedence orders overlays against EACH OTHER, never against this skill.** Read only matched bodies derived as `<protocols-dir>/<Name>.md`; the row's Body link is display text, never a read path. Reject unsafe paths without reading. A matched body that is missing or malformed is REPORTED and skipped — never reconstructed from the index Description. An absent index or no match -> proceed with no overlay, silently. Full contract: `.claude/skills/project-skill-protocol/references/registry.md`.
>
> Overlays are **ADDITIVE ONLY**: they ADD rules on top of this skill's own protocol and NEVER replace, override, disable, or reinterpret a rule it already states — removing every overlay must return this skill to exactly its documented behavior. An overlay is a BRIEF, not an authority escalation: it can NEVER waive a workflow gate, git discipline, a review gate, or a user-confirmation gate. A genuine overlay-vs-skill conflict, or two equally-specific overlays that directly contradict -> surface both to the user; NEVER resolve silently.

**MUST ATTENTION** resolve this skill's overlays from the index at `<docsRoots.projectReference.path>/skill-protocols-reference.md` (default `docs/project-reference/`; overridable in `docs/project-config.json`); an empty task `referenceDocs` does NOT disable this lookup. Read ONLY matched bodies from the directory the index header names (default `docs/project-protocols/`). Specificity (exact > glob > `*`) ranks overlays against EACH OTHER, never against the skill. Missing/malformed body → report and skip; no index or no match → proceed silently. Overlays are ADDITIVE ONLY — never an authority escalation or a gate waiver; equal-tier contradiction goes to the user.

## Closing Reminders

**Protocols in force (concise digest of the SYNC/shared blocks this skill carries):**

- **Source/Test Drift:** Source change → inspect affected tests; don't test migration code.
- **AI Mistake Prevention:** verify generated content against evidence, trace downstream references, verify all affected outputs, re-read after context loss, surface ambiguity.
- **Sub-Agent Selection:** Route specialized domains to matching specialist agent; NEVER `code-reviewer`.
- **Nested Task Creation:** Expand child phases, link parent when nested, one `in_progress`.
- **Project Reference Docs:** Read required project docs (always `lessons.md`) before target work.
- **Critical Thinking:** Traced `file:line` proof per claim; confidence >80% to act.
- **Understand Code First:** Search 3+ patterns and read code before any modification.

- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** break work into small todo tasks using `TaskCreate` BEFORE starting
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** search codebase for 3+ similar patterns before creating new code
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** cite `file:line` evidence for every claim (confidence >80% to act)
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** add a final review todo task to verify work quality
- **Parallel Sub-Agent Dispatch:** Tag tasks PAR/SEQ, group PAR into disjoint-write-set waves, spawn each wave in ONE message, barrier before advancing.
  **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** READ the following files before starting:

**[TASK-PLANNING]** Before acting, analyze task scope and systematically break it into small todo tasks and sub-tasks using TaskCreate.

> **[IMPORTANT]** Analyze how big the task is and break it into many small todo tasks systematically before starting — this is very important.
