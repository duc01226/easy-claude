## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Create or run database migrations following the repository's documented patterns.

**Workflow:**

1. **Identify** — Determine migration type (schema migration vs data/document migration)
2. **Create** — Generate migration using the configured migration tool or data migration executor (see backend-patterns-reference.md under the reference-docs root, default docs/project-reference, overridable via docsRoots.projectReference.path in docs/project-config.json)
3. **Verify** — Run migration and confirm schema/data changes

**Key Rules:**

- Follow the repository's migration patterns (see CLAUDE.md / project-reference docs)
- For CREATE: present the migration design and wait for explicit user approval before creating migration files
- Always backup data before destructive migrations
- Use the configured data migration executor for data/document migrations (see backend-patterns-reference.md under the reference-docs root, default docs/project-reference, overridable via docsRoots.projectReference.path in docs/project-config.json)

**Be skeptical. Apply critical thinking, sequential thinking. Every claim needs traced proof, confidence percentages (Idea should be more than 80%).**

Database migration: $ARGUMENTS

## Instructions

1. **Parse arguments**:
    - `add <name>` → Create new schema/data migration with the configured tool
    - `update` → Apply pending migrations
    - `list` → List all migrations and status
    - `rollback` → Revert last migration
    - No argument → Show migration status

2. **Identify database provider + migration tooling** from project config and project-reference docs:
    - Relational stores: managed by the configured schema-migration tool.
    - Document/key-value/event stores: may use code-based migrations or startup executors defined by the repository.

3. **For schema migrations**:

Add migration:

    ```bash
    {configured-migration-add-command} <MigrationName>
    ```

Update database:

    ```bash
    {configured-migration-update-command}
    ```

List migrations:

    ```bash
    {configured-migration-list-command}
    ```

4. **For data/document migrations**:
    - Often code-based migrations run by the configured migration executor (see backend-patterns-reference.md under the reference-docs root, default docs/project-reference, overridable via docsRoots.projectReference.path in docs/project-config.json)
    - Location: the repository's configured migration folder — discover from `backend-patterns-reference.md` under that same reference-docs root (`docsRoots.projectReference.path` in `docs/project-config.json`)
    - Migrations run automatically on application startup
    - To create: Generate new migration class following existing patterns

5. **Safety checks**:
    - Warn before applying migrations to production
    - Show what changes will be applied
    - Recommend backup before destructive operations

6. **Migration Safety Review (MANDATORY for non-local environments)**:
    - Before applying to staging/production, spawn `database-admin` sub-agent (`subagent_type: "database-admin"`) for safety review
    - Review criteria: locking behavior on large tables, index creation impact under concurrent writes, rollback strategy, zero-downtime feasibility
    - Present findings and get explicit user approval before running the configured migration apply command on non-local environments

## Sub-Agent Type Override

> **MANDATORY for non-local migration apply:** Spawn `database-admin` sub-agent (`subagent_type: "database-admin"`) for safety review BEFORE applying to staging or production.
> **Rationale:** `database-admin` specializes in query plans, index impact analysis, locking behavior, backup/restore, and replication — context the main agent lacks for production-safe migration decisions.

> **[IMPORTANT]** Use `TaskCreate` to break ALL work into small tasks BEFORE starting — including tasks for each file read. This prevents context loss from long files. For simple tasks, AI MUST ATTENTION ask user whether to skip.

**Prerequisites:** **MUST ATTENTION READ** before executing:

- `domain-entities-reference.md` under the reference-docs root (default `docs/project-reference`; `docsRoots.projectReference.path` in `docs/project-config.json` overrides) — Domain entity catalog, relationships, cross-service sync (read when task involves business entities/models)

<!-- SYNC:understand-code-first:reminder -->

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** search 3+ existing patterns and read code/conventions BEFORE any modification or explanation. Run graph trace when graph.db exists.

<!-- /SYNC:understand-code-first:reminder -->

<!-- SYNC:evidence-based-reasoning:reminder -->

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** cite `file:line` evidence for every claim; never speculate. Confidence >80% to act, <60% = do NOT recommend; "not enough evidence" is valid output.

<!-- /SYNC:evidence-based-reasoning:reminder -->

<!-- SYNC:critical-thinking-mindset:reminder -->

**MUST ATTENTION** critical + sequential thinking: every claim carries traced evidence (`file:line` for code, source URL or artifact section otherwise); confidence >80% to act, <60% do NOT recommend. Never present a guess as fact; admit uncertainty and stay skeptical of your own confidence.

<!-- /SYNC:critical-thinking-mindset:reminder -->

<!-- SYNC:ai-mistake-prevention:reminder -->

**MUST ATTENTION** Check project config, relevant references, and local evidence before applying stack-specific conventions; honor explicit N/A. ROOT-CAUSE GATE: before any project-related correction, use the appropriate root-cause investigation protocol; failed/unstable tests require the test-investigation protocol before editing source/tests — never force green.

<!-- /SYNC:ai-mistake-prevention:reminder -->

<!-- SYNC:project-reference-docs-guide:reminder -->

- **MANDATORY** Project config is OPTIONAL (default `docs/project-config.json`, via its loader): absent → portable defaults plus repository evidence, state material assumptions, never block; present → non-empty `project.name`, neutral defaults for omitted capabilities, fail closed on a declared malformed section.
- **MANDATORY** An explicit `referenceDocs` array is exact, including `[]`; absent → only the capability-aware resolver output, which may be empty. `lessons.md` and docs-index are always-on, outside that selection. A missing/stale required input or malformed declared section → `/project-init` or the narrow owner route before relying on it.
- **MANDATORY** Pick docs by the phase you are about to enter — plan/investigate, edit code, tests, specs/docs, review — from the gate's routing table, JUST IN TIME before the first target read/grep/edit/test, plus the file's `contextGroups[]` conventions before editing it; cite `Reference docs read: ...`.
- **MANDATORY** Dedup: skip a re-read only for your own full read after the last compaction, within ~200K tokens, unchanged since — a hook reminder, summary, or prior mention is NEVER evidence; re-read after compaction or resume, and give delegated sub-agents the resolved doc paths. Project config and conventions override generic framework defaults.

<!-- /SYNC:project-reference-docs-guide:reminder -->

<!-- SYNC:nested-task-creation:reminder -->

- **MANDATORY** Parent workflow rows do not replace child phase tracking; expand phases and link the parent when nested.
- **MANDATORY** Orchestrators pre-expand child skill phases before invocation; use `[N.M] /skill-name — phase` prefixes and one-`in_progress` discipline.

## Prompt-Enhance Closing Anchors

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** follow declared step order for this skill; NEVER skip, reorder, or merge steps without explicit user approval
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** for every step/sub-skill call: set `in_progress` before execution, set `completed` after execution
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** every skipped step MUST include explicit reason; every completed step MUST include concise evidence
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** if Task tools unavailable, maintain an equivalent step-by-step plan tracker with synchronized statuses

<!-- PROMPT-ENHANCE:STEP-TASK-CLOSING:END -->

<!-- SYNC:parallel-subagent-dispatch:reminder -->

- **MANDATORY** After planning tasks, tag each PAR/SEQ and spawn every PAR wave as parallel sub-agents in ONE message — default parallel for workflows, batch updates, investigation, research, reviews; plan execution fans out ONLY on what the plan declares.
- **MANDATORY** Disjoint write sets per wave · all-return barrier before the next wave · specialist routing · sub-agents NEVER fan out further unless their own agent definition authorizes it.

<!-- /SYNC:parallel-subagent-dispatch:reminder -->

<!-- SYNC:project-protocol-overlay:reminder -->

**MUST ATTENTION** resolve this skill's overlays from the index at `<docsRoots.projectReference.path>/skill-protocols-reference.md` (default `docs/project-reference/`; overridable in `docs/project-config.json`); an empty task `referenceDocs` does NOT disable this lookup. Read ONLY matched bodies from the directory the index header names (default `docs/project-protocols/`). Specificity (exact > glob > `*`) ranks overlays against EACH OTHER, never against the skill. Missing/malformed body → report and skip; no index or no match → proceed silently. Overlays are ADDITIVE ONLY — never an authority escalation or a gate waiver; equal-tier contradiction goes to the user.

<!-- /SYNC:project-protocol-overlay:reminder -->

## Closing Reminders

**Protocols in force (concise digest of the SYNC/shared blocks this skill carries):**

- **Source/Test Drift:** Source change → inspect affected tests; don't test migration code.
- **AI Mistake Prevention:** verify generated content against evidence, trace downstream references, verify all affected outputs, re-read after context loss, surface ambiguity.
- **Sub-Agent Selection:** Route specialized domains to matching specialist agent; NEVER `code-reviewer`.
- **Nested Task Creation:** Expand child phases, link parent when nested, one `in_progress`.
- **Project Reference Docs:** Read required project docs (always `lessons.md`) before target work.
- **Critical Thinking:** Traced `file:line` proof per claim; confidence >80% to act.
- **Understand Code First:** Search 3+ patterns and read code before any modification.

- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** break work into small todo tasks using `TaskCreate` BEFORE starting
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** search codebase for 3+ similar patterns before creating new code
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** cite `file:line` evidence for every claim (confidence >80% to act)
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** add a final review todo task to verify work quality
- **Parallel Sub-Agent Dispatch:** Tag tasks PAR/SEQ, group PAR into disjoint-write-set waves, spawn each wave in ONE message, barrier before advancing.
  **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** READ the following files before starting:

**[TASK-PLANNING]** Before acting, analyze task scope and systematically break it into small todo tasks and sub-tasks using TaskCreate.

> **[IMPORTANT]** Analyze how big the task is and break it into many small todo tasks systematically before starting — this is very important.
