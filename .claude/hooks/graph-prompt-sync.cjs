/**
 * UserPromptSubmit hook — keep the code graph in step with git HEAD.
 *
 * Trigger: UserPromptSubmit (every prompt)
 * Behavior: Compare the current git HEAD against the last HEAD this hook
 *           evaluated. Identical -> return immediately (no Python spawned).
 *           Changed -> run the graph `sync`, which diffs the graph's
 *           last_synced_commit against HEAD and re-parses what moved.
 *
 * Why this exists: `graph-session-init` only fires at SessionStart, and
 * `graph-auto-update` only fires PostToolUse on Edit|Write|MultiEdit. Neither
 * observes a `git pull` / `git checkout` / `git merge` performed mid-session or
 * between sessions, so code that arrived from someone else was never re-parsed
 * and the graph silently answered from a stale node set.
 *
 * Cost: one `git rev-parse HEAD` (~10-20ms) on a prompt where HEAD is
 * unchanged, which is the overwhelmingly common case. Python is spawned only
 * when HEAD actually moved.
 *
 * Unavailable-dependency case: when HEAD HAS moved but the graph toolchain is
 * not installed, the HEAD gate can never fire — the marker is only written on a
 * decided sync — so EVERY prompt paid two Python spawns to rediscover the same
 * missing package, and the state never self-healed. A bounded negative cache
 * records that verdict for `DEPS_UNAVAILABLE_TTL_MS`; `graph-session-init`
 * clears it the moment an install succeeds. The `.last-seen-head` marker is
 * still NOT written on this path — the graph genuinely is not synced, and
 * claiming otherwise would suppress the sync that follows the repair.
 *
 * Total budget: the component timeouts below sum past this hook's own declared
 * timeout, and `execFileSync` blocks the event loop so that declared timeout
 * cannot fire to stop them. HOOK_BUDGET_MS is therefore enforced HERE, by
 * handing `invokeGraph` only the wall time actually left.
 *
 * Older-checkout case: when HEAD is BEHIND the graph (an older branch or
 * commit the graph already covers), `sync` returns `graph_ahead_skipped` and
 * changes nothing — that rule lives in the Python sync, not here, so every
 * caller of `sync` gets it. This hook still records the HEAD as evaluated so
 * the no-op is not recomputed on every subsequent prompt.
 *
 * Graph mode 'off' (`hooks.codeGraph.enabled` in docs/project-config.json) keeps
 * this hook inert even when an old graph.db exists: no git, no Python.
 *
 * Exit: Always 0 (non-blocking). The prompt is never gated on graph freshness.
