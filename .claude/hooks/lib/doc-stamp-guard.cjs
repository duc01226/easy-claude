/**
 * Doc Stamp Guard — the single owner of one invariant:
 *
 *   A git-TRACKED doc's bytes change ONLY when its meaning changes.
 *
 * Generated and scanned docs carry volatile tokens — `<!-- Last scanned: -->`,
 * `<!-- Last verified: -->`, `last_updated:`, `Regenerated:` — that move on every
 * regeneration whether or not a single word of content changed. Each such rewrite
 * is an unmergeable line at the top of a file that many branches touch, so two
 * branches that both merely RE-RAN a scan conflict over a date neither of them
 * decided. The churn carries zero information and costs a manual merge.
 *
 * Two writers in this repo already discovered the need and solved it privately:
 * `generate-tech-specs.mjs` masks its date before comparing and skips the write
 * (`normalizeGeneratedContent` + the `changed` gate), and `generate_catalogs.py`
 * masks `last_updated` — but only on its `--check` path, never on its write path.
 * This module lifts that rule to one place every writer consults.
 *
 * Whitespace is NOT meaning: line endings, trailing spaces, and runs of blank
 * lines are normalized away before comparing, so a formatter pass alone never
 * counts as a real change. Indentation INSIDE a line is preserved — it is
 * semantic in code fences and nested lists, and masking it would hide real edits.
 *

/**
 * Volatile tokens: text whose value is derived from the CLOCK, not from content.
 *
 * Each entry masks the VALUE and keeps the surrounding text, so a doc that gains
 * or loses a stamp line still reads as changed — only a moved value is masked.
 *
 * Content-derived tokens (the AGENTS.md SHA fingerprint, `[[convention:name@hash]]`,
 * `<!-- COUNT:x -->N<!-- /COUNT -->`) are deliberately ABSENT: they change only
 * when the thing they describe changes, so masking them would hide real drift.

/**
 * DELIBERATELY NOT MASKED — `last_updated:` and `generated_at:`.
 *
 * They look like sibling clock stamps, and masking them was the first instinct.
 * They are not safe here, for two independent reasons:
 *
 *  1. In business-spec front matter (default root docs/specs; a `specRoots.business.path` entry in docs/project-config.json overrides it), `last_updated:` is the spec-sync SIGNAL —
 *     `doc-sync-gate.cjs` reads it (`LAST_SYNC_RE`) to decide whether a spec is in
 *     sync with its code. A `/spec [mode=sync]` run whose whole point is to bump
 *     that date would be classified as churn and unstaged by the commit guard, so
 *     the marker would never land and the sync warning would never clear. One
 *     framework rule would silently defeat another.
 *  2. `last_updated:` and `generated_at:` are ordinary identifiers in source code —
 *     `code_graph/graph.py` declares a `last_updated: Optional[str]` field and
 *     `codex/sync-hooks.mjs` builds a `generated_at:` property. A line-anchored
 *     mask makes a real one-line code edit look like a no-op.
 *
 * The one writer that genuinely needs `last_updated` treated as volatile —
 * `generate_catalogs.py` — owns that decision locally in
 * `normalize_catalog_for_check`, scoped to the catalogs it generates. That is the
 * right altitude: a token is clock-derived in a FILE, never in the abstract.
