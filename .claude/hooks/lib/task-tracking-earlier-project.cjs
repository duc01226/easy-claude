 * The two vocabularies differ in structure: a group kept the list of its members, where each record now names its own
 * areas and initiatives. No record can therefore be put into current terms by itself, and the whole project is mapped at
 * once. Both readers of an earlier project (the working copy and a pinned commit) show this mapping's result, and the
 * migration writes exactly that result, so what is read before a migration is what is stored after it.
 *
 * Pure: it reads the records it is given and nothing else, and changes none of them. The single-word facts it applies
 * (which kinds were groups, what each purpose and state becomes) belong to the vocabulary owner.
