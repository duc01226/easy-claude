/**
 * Workflow route delivery for UserPromptSubmit: the ONLY carrier of the workflow route text.
 * No root instruction file carries routing text; the route arrives here, in the mode the
 * person chose. Resolved by `routing.resolveWorkflowRouteMode` (owner: .claude/scripts/lib/workflow-routing-config.cjs):
 *   - ask  (default): the gate and the catalog; the workflow question is asked only when the model's own route is to start a catalog workflow (direct, single-skill and custom-simple routes ask nothing).
 *   - auto: the gate and the catalog; a matched workflow starts without asking, by its tier.
 *   - off:  a short state notice only (no gate, no catalog): nothing starts without an explicit request.
 * Runs on every host that runs hooks: Claude (settings.json), Codex (the mirrored .codex/hooks.json
 * launcher) and the OpenCode bridge (compiled from settings.json); all three run the same two entry files.
 * Delivery is advisory plaintext, never a blocking decision. A session-scoped ledger suppresses
 * duplicates until content changes (a mode change is a content change), context is compacted, or the
 * transcript grows by about 4.5 MB (the framework's ~200k-token proxy).
 *
 * An optional project-supplied protocol (`portability.workflowRouteProtocol`, team or local,
 * local wins) is appended to the route output in its own marker block. It is part of the delivery
 * content, so a protocol edit re-arms delivery; when nothing is configured the payload is byte-identical.
 *
 * The route is TWO hook outputs, one per hook entry file, because a host cuts any single output above its
 * cap to a short preview. Each entry is a thin call to `runHook(<part>)` here:
 *   - route output (`workflow-route-inject.cjs` → `runHook('route')`): the state line, the gate body (from
 *     .claude/skills/shared/workflow-first-gate.md, filtered to the mode) and the project protocol.
 *     The gate is always written in full; its length never costs the catalog its form. This module never
 *     drops or cuts the gate or a protocol, so a long protocol can take this output past the size a host
 *     shows in full (HOST_OUTPUT_LIMIT), where the host shortens what the reader sees: the output then
 *     says so on its second line (`buildOversizeNotice`).
 *   - catalog output (`workflow-catalog-inject.cjs` → `runHook('catalog')`): the compact
 *     catalog (tier, step count, hint and barrier groups per workflow; step-skill names only while
 *     they fit). A registry too large for one output falls back to the compact rows without the
 *     step-skill names, then to an index (rows with barrier groups, then rows with tier only), then to
 *     a pointer-only form with no workflow rows. Every form keeps the barrier legend's advancement
 *     clause. The `[a ∥ b]` group tokens are kept in the compact catalog and in the index with
 *     parallel-phase marks; the tiers-only index and the pointer-only form omit them
 *     (`start-workflow <id>` loads a workflow's phases), so the wf-cycle W5 runtime-payload check
 *     applies barrier-mark parity only to the two marked forms.
 * Each output keeps its own session record, so either is delivered again without the other. A part
 * name this module does not know writes nothing: an entry that names one is silent, never a second
 * copy of the route output.
 *
 * A source file that cannot be read never silences the route: a corrupt or missing workflows.json is
 * reported in one line of the catalog output while the gate is still delivered, and an unreadable gate
 * file is reported in one line naming it (`buildUnavailableInjection`).
 *
 * Hosts without hook delivery are not supported: a host that runs no hooks, or one whose hooks are
 * disabled or untrusted, receives no route block.
