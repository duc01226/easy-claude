/**
 * The one explicit action that moves a project from the earlier vocabulary to the current one. It never runs as a side
 * effect of a read, a save or upkeep, needs no actor, creates and deletes no record, and adds no history entry, revision
 * or receipt of its own.
 *
 * What it writes is the result of the one whole-project mapping that both readers of an earlier project already show
 * (task-tracking-earlier-project.cjs): each group becomes an area or an initiative, and every record a group listed
 * gains a link to it, because a record now names its own areas and initiatives.
 *
 * Order of work. A progress record is written to the record root first. It holds the member index (every group, its
 * kind, its purpose and the identities it lists) and the identities captured before the first change, because a group's
 * list is the only place membership was stored and is gone once that group is rewritten. Then every record that is not
 * a group is rewritten in place; then each group record is written at its new path and removed from its old one, one
 * file at a time; then the emptied earlier locations are removed; then the project declaration is changed; then the
 * result is compared with what was captured; and only then is the progress record removed. While that record exists
 * every read and save is refused, and running the migration again completes it from the recorded index, never from
 * records that were already rewritten.
 *
 * The comparison includes a recount that does not use the mapping: what each group held is counted from the stored
 * member lists by this module alone and compared with what the reader shows for the area or initiative it became. A
 * difference found before the first change refuses the migration; one found afterwards fails it and keeps the progress
 * record.
 *
 * The migration is one-way: returning to the earlier vocabulary means restoring the record root and the project
 * configuration from version control or a backup. So a run starts only where something can restore them: inside a Git
 * checkout that tracks them with nothing uncommitted, or on a person's word that a backup can (`backupConfirmed`), which
 * is recorded in the progress record so that a repeated run does not ask again. A preview never refuses for that cause;
 * it says so. An unfinished migration can be abandoned by such a restore too, and only on an
 * explicit abandon request: every interrupted or failed result states the steps, and the abandon request removes the
 * progress record once it finds the earlier project back whole. A plain repeated run only ever completes: what a person
 * wants cannot be read from the disk.
 *
 * What a migration cannot conserve is said, never repaired: a proof names the location and content of the record it
 * was checked against, so work linked to a moved or rewritten record stops being currently verified. The preview and
 * the result name that work. No proof is altered.
 *
 * Removing earlier-vocabulary support later removes this module, its command and its suite together.
