/**
 * Round-2 routing pins (review fix G1) — business intent guarded:
 *
 *   required   a workflow that an explicit skill step, the user's named skill or an already-running
 *              parent workflow requires is part of THAT run: it asks no workflow question (ask) and is not
 *              skipped (off). Modes ask and off govern only a workflow the assistant chooses to start, so a
 *              self-chosen catalog workflow still asks first (ask) and is still not started (off)
 *              (BR-WFR-13, TC-WFR-019). The REAL hook runs as a child process in a temp project.
 *   routes     no skill tells the assistant to auto-select a workflow; routing belongs to the route gate.
 *   nested     a Next-Steps hand-off prompt is skipped only when THIS run is a linked step of a parent
 *              workflow (nested=true), never because a `[Workflow]` row merely exists in the task list.
 *   table      the integration-test verify mode keeps the flake verdict table only in its shared owner and
 *              carries no orphaned table separator.
 *   ledger     the retention shape check admits a session's own `_<name>.json` state files, so a session
 *              holding the route-mode directive is still aged and pruned.
 *
 * Portable Test Contract: hook tests use a temp project and a temp HOME; inherited CK_* switches are
 * blanked. Content pins read the framework repo's own shipped files (framework repo only).
