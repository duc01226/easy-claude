// doc-stamp-guard — protect the invariant "a tracked doc's bytes change ONLY when
// its meaning changes".
//
// The churn this guards against is invisible to every other suite: a doc rewritten
// with today's date is byte-different, content-identical, and perfectly valid
// markdown. Nothing fails; the cost lands later, as a merge conflict between two
// branches that each merely RE-RAN a scan and disagreed about a date neither of
// them decided. Content-based assertions are the only ones that can see it.
//
// Asserts:
//   G1  a date-stamp-only rewrite is NOT a meaningful change (the core predicate)
//   G2  whitespace alone is NOT a meaningful change; real prose edits ARE
//   G3  content-derived tokens (COUNT markers, hashes) still count as real changes
//   G4  the predicate is non-vacuous — it does not answer "unchanged" to everything
//   G5  writeDocIfChanged does not touch the file (or its mtime) on a no-op
//   G6  the freshness ledger extends staleness only while its content hash matches
//   G7  the skills that write reference docs carry the no-op guard instruction
//   G8  the staged-diff scanner flags churn and ONLY churn, against a real git index
//   G9  the freshness ledger trusts an entry only when it is provable
//   G10 removing a retired stamp line still counts as a real change
