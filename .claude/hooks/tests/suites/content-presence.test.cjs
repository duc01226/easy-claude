/**
 * Content-Presence Test Suite
 *
 * Re-homes the parity guarantees that USED to be enforced by the now-deleted
 * context-injection hooks. Those hooks injected guidance at runtime; the guidance
 * now lives statically in CLAUDE.md / agent .md so any host
 * reads identical instructions. These are GENUINE presence asserts — each FAILS
 * if the relocated guidance goes missing. No tautologies (we assert specific
 * load-bearing phrases, not "file is non-empty").
 *
 * Coverage (what THIS suite asserts today):
 *   TC-CP-001 — CLAUDE.md carries the workflow route gate and path→reference-doc pointer table.
 *   TC-CP-008 — tracked context surfaces carry the route gate without a duplicated catalog.
 *   TC-CP-015 — the canonical route gate carries the brief complexity assessment, the >80%
 *               catalog-fit rule, table precedence, downgrade guards (investigation, spec/doc sync,
 *               test, review) and auto-select; route examples use canonical step ids; start-workflow
 *               never proposes or asks the user to choose a route.
 *   TC-CP-002 — the universal subagent-bootstrap phrases are present in a
 *               representative sample of agents (one code, one non-code).
 *   TC-CP-003 — agent-code-standards (dev-rules + pattern docs) is present in a
 *               code agent and ABSENT from a non-code agent — the relocated
 *               dev-rules guidance reaches code agents only.
 *   TC-CP-004 — design-system-canonical-guide hook's "read the canonical design-system
 *               doc first for tokens/components/BEM" guidance relocated into the design skill.
 *   TC-CP-006 — ba-refinement-context hook's DoR / hypothesis-validation BA guidance
 *               relocated into the refine skill.
 *   TC-CP-007 — graph-grep-suggester hook's post-grep "run a graph trace, grep can't find
 *               callers/consumers/events" mandate relocated into the investigate skill.
 *   TC-CP-009 — the integration-test execution-discipline rules (verify the WHOLE system,
 *               never hack seed data / drive through real use-case paths, /debug-investigate
 *               the root cause on failure, 60s runtime cap, loop until green) are present in
 *               EVERY integration-test-family skill (write / review / verify / workflow), so the
 *               family runs/diagnoses/clears a suite identically regardless of entry point.
 *   TC-CP-010 — the test-failure fault-adjudication rules (root-cause first, triangulate the
 *               failure against spec AND source, classify SOURCE-WRONG vs TEST-WRONG, and
 *               AskUserQuestion when intended behavior is unclear) are present in EVERY
 *               debug/fix/test-family skill, so every entry point decides WHO is at fault the
 *               same way instead of silently editing whichever side makes the suite green.
 *
 *   TC-CP-011 — the understand skill's report contract (four-part section order, the mandatory
 *               diagram set, the eight-field review-stage rule, the never-invent-a-case-ID rule,
 *               the single-owner target-form rule, and the git-ignored-write HARD RULE) is
 *               present, AND all three reference contracts it loads at Step 0.3 exist with their
 *               load-bearing sections. Every one of these is enforced by prompt text alone — an
 *               edit that drops one silently changes what every run produces.
 *               It also enforces the contract STRUCTURALLY: report-template.md's form registry
 *               must match all three of its per-form tables ID-for-ID, and no other file may
 *               enumerate the form set. Presence checks cannot catch two present-but-disagreeing
 *               statements, which is what drifted in three consecutive review rounds.
 *
 *   TC-CP-016 — the UI-review surface obligations stay wired end to end: the checklist owns the
 *               surface-scope/composition rule, surface-load (B12-B15), container-fit (E9-E11),
 *               forms (§R), dialog-focus (I15) and non-working-control (K10) checks plus the single
 *               severity map; ui-review runs Surface Composition + Surface UX passes and writes
 *               per-surface reports; plan + plan-review bind the UI checklist to front-end plans;
 *               design-spec carries information priority; the calibration set exists. Each phrase
 *               is load-bearing — dropping any one silently lets an overloaded or ancestor-broken
 *               surface pass review again.
 *
 *   TC-GWF-006/058/059/060/041/042/007/010 — the guided workflow flex rules: start-workflow (their single
 *               owner) keeps gate steps fixed, lets core/optional steps flex intent-first with one
 *               deviation-log line each under the baseline runId (closed kind set), keeps data
 *               dependencies and changed-behaviour tests green; workflow-end first checks evidence
 *               for every outcome gate (review-converged via the receipt JSON or a logged cited
 *               report); both review skills read the deviation log; the nested review stays inline.
 *
 *   TC-GWF-019/020/044 — the lean route wrapper (workflow-implement-spec) stops at its gap review on a
 *               vague, contradictory or incomplete spec and escalates to workflow-feature; its plan
 *               scope is anchored to the supplied spec baseline; the two wrapper descriptions route
 *               spec-complete work and spec gaps to opposite routes.
 *
 *   TC-PDL-028 — the shipped hooks guide carries the second-host trust note in one paragraph: a new or
 *               changed delivery step runs only after the user reviews it, the review step (`/hooks`)
 *               is named, the guides deliver until then, and unchanged steps keep their earlier review.
 *
 *   TC-ADS-006 — the commit skill's default message template carries no `Fix-Origin` trailer and no text
 *               claims a sensor or a mandatory trailer (opt-in via `commit.fixOriginTrailer`).
 *   TC-ADS-007 — the commit skill names `commit.fixOriginTrailer`, limits the trailer to new commits only
 *               and never advises rewording existing commits.
 *   TC-ADS-004 — graph-build installs the graph tooling with the cross-OS node `ensurePythonDeps` command
 *               before any graph CLI call, and stops when the install fails.
 *
 *   TC-ADS-008 — the command-only utility skills (decision D-2) each declare exactly one
 *               `disable-model-invocation: true` in frontmatter, and `commit` / `learn` / `git-conflict-resolve` stay
 *               model-callable. Framework-repo guarded (synchronous signal + parity tripwire):
 *               it asserts this repo's own skill defaults, which an adopting project may change.
 *
 *   TC-HTMLX-052 — the three skills that run html-export's script by path (presentation-builder,
 *               pbi-mockup, feature-presentation) and the design motion-storyboard reference carry one
 *               identical `**html-export exit rule:**` line whose codes (0, 4, 3, 1/2 + NOT
 *               VERIFIABLE) are exactly the values of `EXIT` in html-export/scripts/lib/exit-codes.cjs;
 *               the design explore workflow's `| Exit |` table routes exactly those codes with the
 *               same actions (1 and 2 in one tool-failure row); and the script path they name exists.
 *               The callers are prose, so no code import catches a drift. Framework-repo guarded; a
 *               fixture row proves the table check names each kind of drift.
 *
 *   TC-ADS-025 — emphasis diet (P32) keeps the primacy/recency anchors: in each G3-selected skill the
 *               top region (the STEP-TASK anchor block through the end of `## Quick Summary`) and the
 *               `## Closing Reminders` section keep at least their recorded emphasis-marker counts
 *               (MUST/NEVER/CRITICAL/IMPORTANT/BLOCKING, SYNC bodies and frontmatter excluded), so an
 *               anchors-only body edit can never strip the anchors themselves. A fixture row proves the
 *               rule names each stripped anchor; the live row is framework-repo guarded.
 *
 *   TC-PD-001..012, 062 — one deck standard owned by presentation-builder
 *               (spec: docs/specs/Presentation/README.PresentationDecks.md §8). The validator's no-profile
 *               verdict equals `presenter` (001); `review` demotes EXACTLY the five editing checks (002)
 *               and nothing else — a 7-slide deck with no overview control errors in both (004); missing or
 *               blank notes fail both profiles (003); the validator CLI refuses any profile name but exactly
 *               presenter/review with exit 2 and no verdict, and exits 1 with FAIL on a failing deck (005);
 *               every verdict names its profile (006); the feature-presentation review-deck scaffold passes
 *               `review` with Say/Why/Question notes on every slide, no editing control (no contenteditable
 *               markup, no designMode) and its key states, an empty demo dropping its Simulated note behind an
 *               iframe guard, and still passes with the §3b wireframe demo spliced in (007 + 022 + 062), loads
 *               no outside asset (009) and keeps job-named slide ids its deck__slide route and html-export's
 *               default selector both find (010); FP's Step 8 blocks hand-off on `--profile=review` and its
 *               Step 6 outside-asset scan regex, applied case-insensitively, flags every network-load shape
 *               (a font-only mockup included) and no plain link or data-src (008 + 013); the generator warns
 *               only on the default look (011); PB, FP and design explore keep the design-authority, deck-kind
 *               and slide hand-off routes, with the tokens and journey-fix sections of the explore gate files
 *               (012 + 061). The review-deck engine itself runs in node:vm against a fake page: long slides
 *               scroll first, each slide opens at its top, a held key stops at the edge, notes take the keys
 *               only after Tab, Shift+Space goes back (062); presentation-builder's skill-local test files run
 *               as child processes and must exit 0 (062 + 011).
 *               Framework-repo guarded: they assert this repo's own presentation skills.
 *
 * The 3 per-context inject hooks (design-system-canonical-guide / ba-refinement-context /
 * graph-grep-suggester) are now presence-asserted by TC-CP-004, TC-CP-006 and TC-CP-007
 * against the verbatim load-bearing phrases their guidance relocated to. A future skill edit
 * that drops a relocated block fails the matching TC, restoring cross-host parity.
