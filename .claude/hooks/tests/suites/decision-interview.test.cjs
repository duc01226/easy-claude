/**
 * Decision Interview Test Suite
 *
 * One shared protocol, `decision-interview`, owns how a skill puts decisions to the user: facts are
 * the agent's, the user is briefed before the first question, every material decision is asked as a
 * decision card in dependency-ordered rounds, the hosting skill owns the budget, the answers are
 * played back, and a context with no user channel hands the open cards back instead of answering.
 * Four interviews carry it (initiative, spec clarify, plan validate, work-item challenge) and two
 * skills are built on it: `grill` interviews about a free-form subject, `wayfinder` plans an effort
 * too big for one session as a map of decision tickets.
 *
 * Coverage:
 *   TC-DIV-001 — the canonical protocol states its seven rules and is registered with a guide line.
 *   TC-DIV-002 — every carrier holds the protocol the way its file kind requires, and its own
 *                interview step applies it.
 *   TC-DIV-003 — each carrier keeps the budget it owns: plan validate sizes a round, spec clarify
 *                caps a pass and continues only on the user's go-ahead, initiative keeps a hard cap
 *                and records the categories it left unasked; the shared reminder names the budget owner.
 *   TC-DIV-004 — `grill` interviews and records only: it never plans, specifies or implements.
 *   TC-DIV-005 — `wayfinder` plans and never builds, resolves one claimed ticket per session, keeps
 *                its map as files under the relocatable plans root and writes no tracker record.
 *
 * Portability: every row asserts this framework repository's own skills and registry and is skipped
 * in any other project (framework-repo signal). Paths use node:path; nothing is OS-specific.
