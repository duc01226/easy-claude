# relocated-project (test fixture)

Fixture project for `.claude/hooks/tests/suites/docroot-relocation.test.cjs`.
Every relocatable root is declared NON-DEFAULT, so an accessor that ignores
configuration resolves to a path that does not exist here and the test fails.

| Config key | Framework default | Fixture value | Variance class |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `specRoots.business.path` | `docs/specs` | `spec-library` | plain, single segment |
| `specRoots.technical.path` | `docs/specs-technical` | `spec-library-derived` | segment-boundary sibling of the business root |
| `docsRoots.projectReference.path` | `docs/project-reference` | `documentation/reference` | nested two levels |
| `docsRoots.adr.path` | `docs/adr` | `documentation/Decisions` | CASE |
| `docsRoots.templates.path` | `docs/templates` | `documentation\blueprints` | BACKSLASH |
| `docsRoots.plans.path` | `plans` | `work-plans` | plain; beats the `.ck.json` tier |
| `docsRoots.teamArtifacts.path` | `team-artifacts` | `artifacts/` | TRAILING SLASH |
| `docsRoots.productRoadmap.path` | `docs/product-roadmap.md` | `documentation/roadmap.md` | file, relocated tree |

`reference/` exists only for the single-segment `resolveDocsTree` variant (TC-DOCROOT-165).
