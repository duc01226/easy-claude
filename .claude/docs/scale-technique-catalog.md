# Scale Technique Catalog — Applicability by Tier

> This is the full grouped reference the condensed gate points to. It enumerates every common system-design /

> minimum scale tier at which it typically pays off, the review skill that owns its depth, and an
> anti-over-engineering caveat.

> **ADVICE-ONLY.** Hosting reviews surface a Technique Applicability Matrix built from this catalog as *guidance*.
> It MUST NOT mutate any scorecard `/20`, SRE `/24`, verdict band, or gate pass/fail (user decision 2026-07-06).
> A correctly-lean small system is a PASS — never a gap.

## Scale tiers

| Tier | Profile | Signals (derive from evidence — never assume) |
| ---- | ------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **T0** | Internal / single-instance / PoC | one node, no external SLO, low traffic, single tenant, no HA requirement |
| **T1** | Small SaaS (<10k users) | single region, modest RPS, basic SLA, a few instances, one primary DB |
| **T2** | High-scale (10k–1M users) | multi-instance, real SLOs, high RPS, read/write pressure, HA expected |
| **T3** | Massive / multi-region (millions+) | global users, strict tail-latency SLOs, multi-region, partition tolerance, DR/RPO/RTO targets |

> **How to derive the tier:** read users/RPS, SLO & latency targets, data volume, tenancy model, and topology from
> `docs/specs/**`, `docs/project-config.json`, infra/compose/k8s manifests, and load/capacity notes. Cite
> `file:line`/config/infra + a confidence %. **Unknown → state the assumption; do NOT default to T3.**

## Verdicts (per warranted technique)

| Verdict | Meaning | Action |
| ------- | ------- | ------ |
| `PRESENT` | Warranted at this tier and implemented | Acknowledge |
| `MISSING-WARRANTED` | Warranted at this tier, not present | **Advise only** — guidance, not a score/gate lever |
| `N/A-by-scale` | Below its warranting tier | Skip — not a gap |
| `OVER-ENGINEERED` | Present but unwarranted at this tier | **Advise AGAINST** — cite the carrying cost |
