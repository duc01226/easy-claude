## Configuration Files

### settings.json

**Purpose:** Core Claude Code settings including hooks, permissions, and plugins.

| Section          | Purpose                        |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `permissions`    | Tool allow/deny/ask rules      |
| `hooks`          | Event-based hook registrations |
| `env`            | Environment variables          |
| `attribution`    | Commit/PR footer text          |
| `enabledPlugins` | Plugin toggles                 |
| `statusLine`     | Custom status line command     |

**See:** [settings-reference.md](./settings-reference.md) for complete reference.

---

### settings.local.json

**Purpose:** Local overrides not committed to git (gitignored).

**Location:** `.claude/settings.local.json`

**Common uses:** API keys and secrets, personal preferences, development-only hooks, local MCP servers.

```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "local-db": {
            "command": "node",
            "args": ["./local-mcp-server.js"],
            "env": { "DB_HOST": "localhost" }
        }
    }
}
```

---

### .ck.json

**Purpose:** Claude Kit settings for output style, planning, and hook behavior. Project-specific architecture and coding conventions belong in `docs/project-config.json` and its referenced project documentation.

```json
{
    "plan": {
        "namingFormat": "{date}-{issue}-{slug}",
        "dateFormat": "YYMMDD-HHmm",
        "validation": {
            "mode": "auto",
            "minQuestions": 3,
            "maxQuestions": 8
        }
    },
    "assertions": ["Search for existing implementations before creating new code", "Follow the project's documented architecture and conventions"]
}
```

| Field               | Type     | Description                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `plan.namingFormat` | string   | Plan directory naming pattern                                                                                                                                                  |
| `plan.validation`   | object   | Plan validation interview. `mode`: `auto` (default) runs the interview after a standalone `/plan` saves its plan, `prompt` asks first, `off` skips it; a direct `/plan --mode=validate` and a workflow step always run. `minQuestions` is the breadth floor and `maxQuestions` the size of one question round, never a cap on the interview |
| `assertions`        | string[] | Legacy compatibility field. The standard SessionStart path does not add it to prompt context; active project rules belong in `docs/project-config.json` and its reference docs |
| `locale`            | object   | Language settings for thinking/responses                                                                                                                                       |
| `trust`             | object   | Trust passphrase configuration                                                                                                                                                 |

In this repository, the SessionStart hook loads `.ck.json` settings but does not inject the `assertions` array into prompt text. Keep this field only for compatibility with external consumers; use `contextGroups` and project reference docs for active project conventions.

**See:** [output-styles.md](./output-styles.md) for custom output styles.

### Experience verification

Project-specific user/downstream experience review is configured in
`docs/project-config.json` under `experienceVerification`. It supports
web/mobile/desktop/terminal/API/library/background/generated surfaces without
assuming a particular runner. See
[experience-verification.md](./experience-verification.md) for the evidence,
baseline, and explicit-acceptance lifecycle.

#### Code Review Configuration

The `codeReview` section records which project-specific review-rule doc the review skills/agents read. No hook or script reads this section: review skills read the rules on demand via the hook-delivered project-reference-docs gate (`SYNC:project-reference-docs-guide`), so these fields document intent and change no behavior.

| Field            | Type     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ---------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `enabled`        | boolean  | Whether review skills/agents consult the rules doc (default: `true`)                                                                                                                                                                |
| `rulesPath`      | string   | Path to rules markdown file (default: `code-review-rules.md` in the project-reference docs root, itself defaulting to `docs/project-reference` unless `docsRoots.projectReference.path` in `docs/project-config.json` overrides it) |
| `injectOnSkills` | string[] | Skills associated with the review-rules doc                                                                                                                                                                                         |

**To update code review rules:** Edit `code-review-rules.md` in the project-reference docs root directly. Review skills/agents read it on demand via the project-reference-docs gate.

### Team work tracking

Tracking works without a shared member registry when the selected checkout has usable Git author settings. The optional example below configures shared custom identities and policy; merge only needed fields into the project config selected by `portability.projectConfigPath` (default `docs/project-config.json`), retaining the other sections. `docsRoots.teamArtifacts.path` defaults to `team-artifacts` and can select the team's existing artifact folder.

Resolve the selected checkout and config through the existing project-config loader. Copying the framework does not enroll a project: absent tracking settings use neutral defaults and automatic upkeep is `off`. An explicitly requested actor-dependent action can resolve the local author without writing a shared member or enabling upkeep. `help` needs no project config; supported inspection uses the selected roots without initializing or rewriting them.

When already authorized work needs missing or invalid project context repaired, perform the narrow [project-config](../../skills/project-config/SKILL.md) setup; use [project-init](../../skills/project-init/SKILL.md) when broader required project context also needs setup. The minimum valid config is a non-empty `project.name` derived from that adopter's metadata or root directory, with no inferred stack or tracking capability. Do not create a second tracker initializer. Merge only the needed evidence-backed fields, validate the selected file, reread it, and make repeated setup a no-op when the requested state already exists. Needed safe setup follows the active task's authority; a configured disablement or unresolved member/profile decision is preserved rather than filled from the example.

| Selected configuration | Required handling |
| --- | --- |
| No config, or valid minimal project identity with no tracking section | Retain neutral tracking defaults; create required project context only through the existing setup owner when the authorized task needs it |
| Valid custom config path, artifact roots, members or profile | Resolve those actual values; preserve unrelated/custom content and unmanaged host settings, with no authoring-project paths copied into the adopter |
| Explicit automatic tracking `off`, opted-out item, or restricted skill selection | Keep that choice; setup does not enable automatic upkeep, relink work or authorize a heavy skill |
| Malformed declared config or tracking capability | Refuse affected operations with the original sources retained; route narrow repair to the project-config owner, then validate before retry |
| Declared native profile without demonstrated owner capabilities | Report unavailable and retain its sources; registration does not authorize portable serialization or infer a native writer |

```json
{
    "docsRoots": { "teamArtifacts": { "path": "team-artifacts" } },
    "taskTracking": {
        "schemaVersion": 3,
        "mode": "linked",
        "profile": { "kind": "portable-markdown", "version": 1 },
        "members": [
            { "id": "member-1", "displayName": "Example member", "active": true }
        ],
        "report": { "enabled": true, "autoRefresh": true }
    }
}
```

Replace the optional example member with actual custom identities, or omit `members` to use local Git identity. IDs survive display-name changes; aliases must resolve unambiguously. An absent section means mode `off` and an empty shared member registry; it does not prevent an explicitly permitted local-author action or change the existing explicit common-core capture route. A malformed declared section refuses affected operations. `off` disables automatic upkeep, `observe` gives reminders, and `linked` permits bounded activity at actual saved checkpoints for exact session-linked items. Off/observe optional checkpoints exit before author lookup. Explicit human actions remain separate. A ticket is optional.

`taskTracking.schemaVersion` names the vocabulary the stored records use: `3` is the current vocabulary (initiative, task, story, subtask and area, each kind with its own statuses); `2` is the earlier one. A project at `2`, or an unconfigured project holding the earlier group folders (`projects/`, `visions/`), is read in the current words and is read-only: every save is refused with `MIGRATION_REQUIRED` and automatic upkeep is skipped until `migrate` has run. A project at `1`, the first vocabulary, or an unconfigured one holding `pbis/`, `ideas/` or `epics/`, is refused by name with `UNSUPPORTED_VOCABULARY`: this copy neither reads nor migrates it, so upgrade it with a framework copy that supports the first vocabulary, then migrate. Read [the migration procedure](../../skills/task-track/references/manual-operations.md) before running it, and [Work-tracker vocabulary](../../config/README.md#work-tracker-vocabulary--migrating-an-adopting-project) for the upgrade steps.

#### Areas, initiatives and labels

An area says where work belongs and an initiative says why it is done. Both are optional, and so is every tag: any record may be tagged to any number of areas, and any record but an area to any number of initiatives, the tag is saved on the tagged record through the `tag` operation, and no record lists its members. An area may carry a level and sits under any number of parent areas; a parent is never at a deeper level than its child, and an `application`-level area has no parent. An initiative carries a type, its own statuses (`draft`, `approved`, `committed`, `done`, `canceled`) and optionally a priority level (`high`, `medium`, `low`); an initiative, a task, a story or a subtask may carry a due date. This introduces no required wrapper and no fixed nesting depth. Read [areas and tags](../../skills/task-track/references/manual-operations.md#areas-and-tags) for the actual retained request, preview, actor and conflict guards.

| Area level, shallowest first | Default display label |
| --- | --- |
| `application` | Application |
| `product` | Product |
| `module` | Module |
| `feature` | Feature |

| Initiative type | Default display label |
| --- | --- |
| `feedback` | Feedback |
| `idea` | Idea |
| `initiative` | Initiative |

Optional `taskTracking.levelLabels` accepts only the four level keys, and optional `taskTracking.typeLabels` only the three type keys. Each declared value is nonblank text, at most 160 characters before trimming, with no control characters; display trims surrounding whitespace. Omitted keys use defaults, including when the object or tracking configuration is absent. Duplicate label text is legal. Labels supply no owner selection, tag, permission or executable instruction, and never change a stored level, the order of levels or a count; commands select stable item IDs. Malformed declared labels refuse affected operations rather than silently defaulting. Pinned reads use the labels and tags of the selected commit, preserving local/shared source distinctions. `taskTracking.groupLabels` belongs to the earlier vocabulary: it is accepted only in a project that declares `schemaVersion: 2`, where the migration turns it into level and type labels (and refuses while a different label is already declared for the level or type a group label becomes), and it is an unknown field in a current project.

Optional `taskTracking.kindLabels` sets a display word for a kind, keyed by the current kind words (`initiative`, `task`, `story`, `subtask`, `area`). It follows the same text rules as a level label and changes displayed text only: stored kinds, identities, folders, counts, requests and results keep the tracker's words. A label may not borrow text that already means something else, compared without regard to letter case or surrounding blanks, and may not repeat another kind's label; either is refused as invalid configuration (`INVALID_CONFIG`), and the refusal names the field and the label. Which text is taken depends on the vocabulary the project declares. At `schemaVersion: 3` it is every other word of either vocabulary (a kind, a status, a level, a type, a priority level, a group purpose or a link relation) and every other default label of the current one. At `schemaVersion: 2` the keys are the earlier kinds (so `area` is an unknown field there) and the taken text is the words and default labels of the earlier vocabulary alone, so a label that was valid when it was declared keeps the project readable; a label the current vocabulary uses for something else is not shown, and `migrate` names it before any change, with the rename as the next action. The link relation that carries a kind's word is shown under that kind's label as well.

A framework copy older than the current vocabulary refuses a configuration that declares `schemaVersion: 3`, `levelLabels` or `typeLabels`, and a copy older than `kindLabels`, `report.detail` or `report.maxBytes` refuses a configuration that carries them. Update every copy of the framework before a project uses any of these.

Use `inspect --root CHECKOUT --scope EXACT_ID` or `check --root CHECKOUT --scope EXACT_ID` through `node .claude/skills/task-track/scripts/task-track.cjs` to read one exact area or initiative; omit `--scope` for project scope, and add `--figures` to `inspect` for the delivery figures of every area and every initiative. Delivery is stated by one rule for the project, every area and every initiative: it comes only from tags, counts each eligible task once in a scope, excludes canceled/retired tasks and gives no credit to a story, a subtask, an initiative or an area. An area's scope is the tasks tagged to it or to any area beneath it, so a parent's figure is not the sum of its children; an initiative's scope is the tasks linked directly to it; a task with no area belongs to the project as a whole. An area's status changes no figure. Read exact `scope.eligibleTaskIds`, excluded/supporting identities and coverage before relying on counts. Partial, malformed or bounded scope retains reasons and withholds a complete percentage; an empty scope states none; an unavailable scope has null metrics. Global work and exact linked concerns remain inspectable, with current proof, historical acceptance and owner health separate. Supported portable reads require no custom vocabulary or native adapter.

The core package requires Node 18+ and pins `yaml` 2.9.1 in its manifest and lockfile. The optional app requires Node 20+. From the selected checkout, the same commands work on Windows, macOS or Linux:

```text
node --version
node .claude/skills/task-track/scripts/task-track.cjs identity --root .
node .claude/skills/task-track/scripts/task-track.cjs inspect --root .
node .claude/skills/task-track/scripts/task-track.cjs report --root .
node .claude/skills/task-track/scripts/task-track.cjs serve --root .
```

`help` and `identity` use Node built-ins. Every other command needs the pinned parser and installs it by itself when it is missing or at another version, so no setup step comes first. The install is one attempt of `npm ci --omit=dev --ignore-scripts --no-audit --no-fund` inside `.claude/skills/task-track`, with npm's own network wait held to 30 seconds and no retries: runtime packages only, the lockfile's exact version and integrity hash, package scripts off. It runs through the startup installer's launcher and lock rather than its own: an npm found on PATH outside the project, a fixed command template on Windows, one install per folder at a time, and an install still running after 120 seconds stopped as a whole process tree. A second command started meanwhile waits up to a minute and then uses the first one's install. No registry credentials or personal npm settings are passed unless `CK_STARTUP_INSTALL_TRUST=1` grants them; set it when the registry, proxy or certificates come from an npmrc file. A completed install prints `{"status":"setup","installed":[…]}` on stderr and the command then answers normally.

When the install cannot complete, the command refuses with `PACKAGE_SETUP_FAILED`, the cause and what to do by hand; a package is never reported usable after a failed or stopped install. Causes are: no npm on PATH, or only one inside the project; npm ending with an error or being stopped at the limit; another setup of the folder still running; a lock the machine cannot prove private to one account; a missing lockfile or manifest; or `CK_AUTO_INSTALL_DEPENDENCIES=0`. Running the printed `npm ci` command inside the folder is the by-hand route, including where npm is a version-manager link that automatic setup cannot start. An automatic install omits the skill's own development packages; rerun `npm ci --include=dev` there before the workspace browser tests. Hooks never install; they stay advisory when the parser is missing. For implicit identity, Git must be available and the selected path must be its exact checkout root. The read-only `identity` command returns the selected actor/name/source without changing settings or work. It reads effective `user.email` and `user.name`, honoring ordinary local/global/includeIf/worktree configuration; injected Git author/context variables cannot substitute another root or person. No remote credentials, passwords or credential helpers are read. Git author metadata is attribution, not authentication or additional permission.

Automatic identity uses the lower-case email as ID and the author name, or full lower-case email when name is missing. Addresses use printable ASCII U+0021–U+007E, exactly one `@` with nonempty portions, no spaces/control and at most 254 characters; no mailbox/network check occurs. Automatic/profile names allow 254 characters with no controls; configured display names retain 160. Custom slug IDs retain 80, configured email IDs and valid email aliases allow 254, and ordinary aliases retain 160. Unambiguous configured ID/email-alias matching keeps custom spelling/name; display-name similarity cannot choose an implicit actor. An explicit `--actor EXACT_CUSTOM_ID` always keeps that exact configured choice, without falling back to Git. An inactive custom actor retains its existing operation-specific eligibility, including permitted unassignment; inactive recipients cannot receive new assignment.

`serve` binds one loopback checkout and defaults to read-only, without resolving an author. A writable local launch needs no shared enrollment, `--open` opens it in the machine's own browser, and `--terminal` runs it in a terminal window of its own:

```text
node .claude/skills/task-track/scripts/task-track.cjs serve --root . --write --open --terminal
```

With `--terminal` the command writes a launcher script under the project `tmp/task-tracking/launch/`, asks the machine to open it in a terminal window (macOS Terminal, a Windows console window, or the first available Linux terminal program) and returns; the workspace runs in that window and stops when the window is closed or Ctrl+C is pressed there. Without `--terminal` the workspace runs in the calling process. No window is opened when `CI` is set, `CK_NO_AUTO_OPEN=1`, a Linux session has no display, a path holds a character the launcher script cannot carry, or the launcher folder is a link or leaves the project; the command then reports `not-opened` with the reason.

For an existing configured custom identity, preserve explicit selection:

```text
node .claude/skills/task-track/scripts/task-track.cjs serve --root . --write --open --actor member-1
```

`--open` asks for Google Chrome when it is installed and the default browser otherwise, with a literal launcher per platform and only this workspace's loopback address as its argument. It opens nothing when `CI` is set, with `CK_NO_AUTO_OPEN=1`, or on Linux without `DISPLAY` or `WAYLAND_DISPLAY`. The single output line carries `launch.status`: `requested` with the browser asked, or `not-opened` with the reason. The app keeps serving either way, and a request does not prove a page opened.

The launcher is given a launch link, not the session address: it attaches one page, once, and expires after a minute. The link still reaches the launcher as a process argument. On Linux it can stay in the browser's command line when the browser was not already open, where other local accounts can read it; on macOS it is visible only for the moment the `open` command runs; on Windows other standard accounts cannot read it. Someone who read it would have to use it within that minute and before the real page does, and the real page would then report the link as already used. On a machine shared with other signed-in users, leave `--open` off and open the printed address yourself.

An attached tab keeps its session for as long as the tab lives, so a reload stays attached. Opening the address without a session shows nothing of the work: the page says that one address serves one workspace and, for a launch that used `--open`, offers `Open this workspace`, which asks the running command to open a new attached tab on its own machine. That request needs no session, returns only the launch outcome, is limited to one every few seconds, and is refused for a launch without `--open`. A page cannot choose another folder; another project is served by launching it from its own checkout.

The writable app and session `link` accept either an independently resolved current local author or an exact configured custom ID. `apply` can omit `--actor`, but its retained JSON `actor.memberId` remains mandatory and must match the independently resolved caller; never take identity from that body or rewrite it on retry. Keep the explicit custom-ID recipe for existing workflows. New assignment/start requires an eligible active configured member or currently validated local author. Only writable worktree data adds the current implicit actor as a self-assignment choice; historical/read-only/pinned snapshots grant no new eligibility.

An unavailable Git checkout/process gives `IDENTITY_UNAVAILABLE`; a selected path that differs from the exact Git checkout root gives `WRONG_ROOT`; unusable email/name, invalid custom selection or ambiguity gives `INVALID_MEMBER`. These refuse the identity-dependent action without changing work, shared settings or members. Correct the normal author configuration or select a valid custom actor; tracker setup does not mutate Git settings. If an implicit email changes after launch/link, `STALE_ACTOR` preserves the pending request/draft and successful primary; explicitly relaunch/relink and reconsider the action without rebinding the old retry. A mismatched app request gives `WRONG_ACTOR`. Ordinary reading/reporting/advisory guidance stays useful without identity lookup.

Keep the launch URL private: its fragment carries an ephemeral token. Drafts stay in memory and disappear when the page closes or reloads; stop the server with Ctrl+C. The generated `tmp/task-tracking/project-status.html` stays readable offline. Inspection has no limit on the total size of a project's records and the specs and sources they link to: a project is read whole, and only a single file larger than the per-file budget is reported as unavailable; coverage is then partial and that file is named. The full report has no size limit and is never refused for its size; it lists every inspected record and states when inspection itself was incomplete. Optional `taskTracking.report.detail` (`full`, `packed` or `none`; default `packed`, the compact version) sets how much record detail the default report carries, and optional `taskTracking.report.maxBytes` (a positive whole number of bytes) makes the tool write the richest form that fits. Unset, a compact report is held to 15 MiB and the full version to no budget. `packed` holds the same detail as `full` in a file several times smaller and opens it with scripts on, which suits a copy that is published or sent; it is compression, not protection. A compact report says at the top and beside its list of records that it is the compact version; `report --detail full` writes the full version. Every form lists every inspected record. `report --open` requests a viewer; the request alone does not prove it opened. The app's `Report` tab always shows the full version in place for the scope selected there, written by the same report path, brings it up to date when the tab is opened and on `Refresh report`, and works in a read-only session. The report is shown in a sandboxed frame with no access to the app page or its session, and the page's content policy admits the report's one script and one stylesheet by content hash only. Optional `healthOwnerId` selects an existing item; health requires a deliberate dated assessment and never follows delivery percentage.

An authorized save by an unregistered Git contributor retains only bounded `id` and `displayName` in that record's `tracking.memberProfiles`, together with its ordinary history/receipt. Repeated saves preserve the first captured name and prior contributors; configured actors add no redundant profile. Configured names take display precedence. Saved historical profiles are inactive display attribution and cannot authorize acting, new assignment or health ownership. A separately permitted local-only dated attestation remains history, but an ordinary later read shows health Unknown without an eligible configured owner; eligible configured-owner attestations retain the existing policy.

For a direct item entry, append `&item=<encoded stable ID>` and optionally `&owner=<encoded project-relative owner path>` to the private launch URL fragment. The app consumes these selectors once, removes the fragment, and selects only a unique owner in the inspected project. A missing or ambiguous target shows a reason and offers the current work list; it never switches projects.

Stopping the server stops new admission and drains admitted actions and their responses. Shutdown has a 20-second deadline. If admitted work remains, the CLI reports an indeterminate outcome rather than claiming it was canceled or saved; inspect the record and retry the original operation identity. A forced transport close cannot cancel an already admitted filesystem operation.

The CLI and app share `.claude/hooks/lib/task-tracking.cjs` policy. Proposals live in the selected checkout; `report --ref <local-ref>` reads one pinned local Git commit without fetch or worktree substitution, so remote freshness stays unknown. Current test proof and explicit human acceptance are separate. A saved primary remains saved when report or tracking upkeep is pending. Retain the original request/checkpoint and recover only pending work. Prefer cancellation/retirement; exact draft deletion requires a current preview and retains local recovery bytes. Ended work (canceled or retired) that nothing references can be deleted entirely with `--delete-item`, an explicit reason and a current preview; open, started or accepted work is canceled or retired first, and nothing cascades. A state outside the usual steps, such as canceled work back to draft, is set with the `transition` operation, `correction: true`, a reason and `--change-state`; delivery work is never placed in `done` this way. Each usual step of an initiative (approve, commit, close as done, cancel, reopen) needs `--decide`, an explicit decision by a person; a correction of one needs `--change-state` and a reason instead. Read `.claude/skills/task-track/references/manual-operations.md` when you need the recipe for any of these actions. Clearing local recovery ends that replay horizon.

Native registration grants no capability. Native mutation and rendering remain unavailable until the owner supplies footprint, retry and read proofs; requests refuse with original sources preserved and no portable serializer fallback. See [task-track](../../skills/task-track/SKILL.md) for purpose-mode routing, [manual operations](../../skills/task-track/references/manual-operations.md) for catalogue-derived recipes and refusals, and [linked integration](../../skills/task-track/references/integration-guide.md) for exact concerns, producer checkpoints and recovery. Standalone pull requests use the `pull-request` producer; nested procedures retain their linked saving producer and actual context. Publication success remains separate from filesystem observation, proof and acceptance.

### Per-file convention injection

`docs/project-config.json` `contextGroups[]` entries double as convention classes; the optional top-level `conventionInjection` object switches the per-file reminder hook (`file-convention-inject.cjs`) on. Absent object or `enabled` not `true` ⇒ the hook is silent.

```json
{
    "contextGroups": [
        {
            "name": "feature-spec",
            "pathRegexes": [],
            "pathGlobs": ["docs/specs/**/*.md"],
            "priority": 100,
            "skills": ["spec"],
            "referenceDocs": ["docs/project-reference/feature-spec-reference.md"]
        },
        {
            "name": "general-code",
            "pathRegexes": [],
            "pathGlobs": ["**/*"],
            "excludePathGlobs": ["**/node_modules/**", "tmp/**"],
            "fileExtensions": [".js", ".cjs"],
            "priority": 900,
            "referenceDocs": ["docs/project-reference/code-review-rules.md"]
        }
    ],
    "conventionInjection": { "enabled": true }
}
```

| `conventionInjection` field | Default   | Allowed       | Meaning                                                                                                         |
| --------------------------- | --------- | ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `enabled`                   | `false`   | boolean       | Explicit opt-in                                                                                                 |
| `maxChars`                  | `4000`    | 500–10000     | Reminder size cap                                                                                               |
| `maxClassesPerEdit`         | `4`       | 1–10          | Classes per trigger (applied before dedup)                                                                      |
| `reinjectAfterBytes`        | `4500000` | ≥ 4500000     | Conversation-history growth (transcript bytes, ~5–6 per visible character, ≈200K tokens) that re-arms a class   |
| `reinjectAfterMinutes`      | `30`      | 1–1440        | Age re-arm when history size is unknown but condensations ARE observed (host report or transcript mark)         |
| `blindReinjectAfterMinutes` | `5`       | 1–1440        | Age re-arm when the scope is blind — no transcript AND no condensation ever observed, so age is the only signal |
| `onRead`                    | `true`    | boolean       | Reads trigger reminders too                                                                                     |
| `compactionMarkers`         | `[]`      | regex strings | Extra transcript condensation marks                                                                             |

Each group may also set `on` — which file operation delivers it: `read`, `edit`, or `both` (default `both`, so an omitted `on` keeps delivery on reads and edits). `edit` keeps a group's read-first docs and skill pointers off plain reads; `conventionInjection.onRead: false` still turns read delivery off for every group. Any other value is a validation error naming the group and `read|edit|both`.

A class may also match a file by what it contains: `contentRegexes` (case-insensitive regexes tested against the first 16 KiB of the file; the framework's own `ai-feature-gate` patterns see the first 64 KiB) plus `contentExtensions` (the text/code extensions that are scanned), with an optional short `contentLabel` shown in the generated activation table. Files over 2 MiB, binary, missing or unreadable never match, a path that resolves outside the project (a link out) is never read, an excluded path is never read, and only classes that declare content signals cause a read. Limits the validator enforces: at most 64 regexes of up to 500 characters, at most 64 extensions, a label of up to 80 characters; `contentRegexes` without `contentExtensions` is an error. A regex whose running time cannot be bounded — a repeated group that repeats (`(x+)+`), alternatives that can start alike under a repetition (`(a|aa)+`), back-to-back open-ended repetitions (`a*a*`, `.*.*`) or a back-reference — is an error (`unsafe content regex`), and the runtime ignores such a regex if it reaches it; use bounded repetitions such as `{0,80}`. A list over its cap is an error for the validator; the runtime keeps only the first 64 usable entries. The framework's `ai-feature-gate` class uses this to deliver the AI-engineering protocol on files that call a model SDK.

Class fields deciding membership (`pathRegexes`, `pathGlobs`, `fileNameRegexes`, `excludePathRegexes`, `excludePathGlobs`, `fileExtensions`, and the content signals below) are part of the class's content version, so editing one re-delivers the class and changes its `[[convention:name@hash8]]` tag — regenerate CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md afterwards. `guideDoc`/`patternsDoc` are the only fields used for documentation-impact routing (`.claude/scripts/doc-impact-map.cjs`); the delivery matchers are not.

Validate with `node .claude/hooks/lib/project-config-schema.cjs --validate docs/project-config.json`. Typical errors: `contextGroups[1] ("general-code"): needs at least one include matcher (pathRegexes, pathGlobs, fileNameRegexes, or contentRegexes with contentExtensions)`, a duplicate or blank `name`, a malformed regex (the error names the class), or an out-of-range `conventionInjection.<field>`. Unknown group fields and a non-whole `priority` are warnings. Check what a file receives: `node .claude/hooks/lib/file-conventions.cjs --lookup <path>`. Details: [../hooks/README.md § Per-File Convention Injection](../hooks/README.md#per-file-convention-injection).

### Session prompt ledger

The optional `.claude/.ck.json` `promptLedger` object tunes the prompt-ledger hook (`prompt-ledger.cjs`), which records every user prompt of a session and re-anchors the original goal after condensation. It is ON by default — no config needed; `enabled: false` (or `CK_PROMPT_LEDGER=0|off|false`) makes it inert, leaving the hook-delivered `task-planning-rules` protocol (`SYNC:session-goal-ledger`) as the only carrier.

```json
{ "promptLedger": { "enabled": true, "maxPromptChars": 4000, "maxEntries": 200, "reinjectAfterBytes": 1000000, "reinjectAfterMinutes": 45 } }
```

| `promptLedger` field   | Default   | Allowed   | Meaning                                                          |
| ---------------------- | --------- | --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `enabled`              | `true`    | boolean   | Record prompts and deliver reminders                             |
| `maxPromptChars`       | `4000`    | 200–20000 | Per-prompt stored size before a truncation marker                |
| `maxEntries`           | `200`     | 2–1000    | Entries kept per session (the original request is never evicted) |
| `reinjectAfterBytes`   | `1000000` | ≥ 50000   | Conversation-history growth that re-arms the reminder            |
| `reinjectAfterMinutes` | `45`      | 1–1440    | Age re-arm when history size is unknown                          |

Records live in `tmp/prompt-ledger/<session>/` (override `CK_PROMPT_LEDGER_DIR`) and are pruned after 7 days. Out-of-range values are clamped, not rejected. Details: [../hooks/README.md § Session Prompt Ledger](../hooks/README.md#session-prompt-ledger).

### Advisory prompt routers

Four UserPromptSubmit accelerators are ON by default and inject a short directive; the universal rules (delivered by the universal hook) still bind without them, so turning one off loses only the reminder. `.claude/.ck.local.json` overrides `.ck.json` per key (local wins), and the switch accepts `false` or the strings `"0"`, `"off"`, `"false"`, `"no"`, `"disabled"`.

| Hook                            | Injects when                                                                                                                                 | Opt-out (`.claude/.ck.json`)                          | Env opt-out                      |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `commit-skill-route.cjs`        | the prompt asks for a commit — run the `commit` skill, never a raw `git commit` (`review-commit-gate.cjs` still blocks an unreviewed commit) | `{ "commitSkillRoute": { "enabled": false } }`        | `CK_COMMIT_SKILL_ROUTE=0`        |
| `judgement-integrity-route.cjs` | the prompt asks for a verdict, root cause, evaluation, or gap hunt — the `SYNC:judgement-integrity:reminder` directive                       | `{ "judgementIntegrityRoute": { "enabled": false } }` | `CK_JUDGEMENT_INTEGRITY_ROUTE=0` |
| `core-principles-inject.cjs`    | first prompt or task step of a session scope, then again after ~`reinjectAfterTokens` (default 150000) of transcript growth or a compaction — the `SYNC:core-engineering-principles` gate | `{ "corePrinciplesInject": { "enabled": false } }`  | `CK_CORE_PRINCIPLES_INJECT=0`    |
| `ai-feature-route.cjs`          | the prompt asks to build, plan, change or review an AI feature (an AI technique such as LLM calls, RAG, embeddings, tool/function calling or the Claude API/SDK — not "Claude Code" — AND an action on it) and is not about the framework's own machinery — one short directive (one protocol pointer, the `ai-engineering-review` skill / reviewer sub-agent route) once per session window; questions and framework-meta prompts stay silent | `{ "aiFeatureRoute": { "enabled": false } }`        | `CK_AI_FEATURE_ROUTE=0`          |

### Hook-only delivery: host requirements

The universal rules (`protocol-inject-universal-<n>.cjs` bins), the workflow route (`workflow-route-inject.cjs` for the gate, `workflow-catalog-inject.cjs` for the catalog) and the skill-overlay reminder (`skill-overlay-remind.cjs`) are delivered only by hooks; `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` hold project information only and no static fallback exists.

- **Hookless hosts are unsupported:** a host that runs no hook gets no universal rules, no route and no overlay reminder.
- **Settings kept across an upgrade:** a re-export replaces `.claude/settings.json`; a project that keeps its own file must copy new hook entries from the framework's settings, then run `/sync-codex`. At session start `verify-install.cjs` names a route entry registered without the other (gate without catalog, or the reverse).
- **Codex:** the project must be trusted and each new or changed handler reviewed in `/hooks` before it runs. Until then Codex receives no universal rules and no route. Review the handlers after the first `/sync-codex` and after any handler change.
- **OpenCode sub-agents:** OpenCode has no `SubagentStart`; a sub-agent receives the universal bundle only if its child session's first `chat.message` fires the bridge's `UserPromptSubmit`. That path is unverified (no test covers it); grep a sub-agent transcript for `CK:UNIVERSAL-PROTOCOLS 1/4` to check.

Per-handler detail: [../hooks/README.md § Hook-only delivery: host requirements](../hooks/README.md#hook-only-delivery-host-requirements).

### Workflow route mode (per person)

The workflow route — how a prompt becomes a direct answer, a skill, a custom route or a workflow — is delivered **only by hooks**, in the mode each person chooses: `workflow-route-inject.cjs` writes the route output (the `Route mode:` state line and the gate) and `workflow-catalog-inject.cjs` writes the workflow catalog as a second output. The root files (`CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`) carry no route text and no pointer.

| Mode | What the hooks inject | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ask` (default) | The gate, and the compact workflow catalog as a second output | The **workflow question** (full workflow · slimmer custom route · execute directly) is asked only when the model's own route is to start a catalog workflow, on the first task of a session; a direct, single-skill or custom-simple route proceeds without asking; an explicit request runs with no question |
| `auto` | The gate and the catalog, each worded for auto-start | The matched workflow starts without asking, by its tier: `auto` starts, `confirm` asks once only when a leaner route would also do, `manual` never starts on its own |
| `off` | A short state notice only — no gate, and no catalog output | No workflow or workflow skill starts without an explicit request; the model executes directly or with the one skill you name. Every quality gate still binds |

An explicit request (`/workflow-*`, `/start-workflow <id>`, `$workflow-*` on Codex, or asking in words) runs in every mode. So does a workflow that an explicit skill step, the skill you named or an already-running parent workflow requires (for example `/commit` running `/workflow-integration-test --mode=green` to fix a failing test): it is part of that run, not a self-matched workflow — it asks no workflow question and `off` does not skip it; `ask` and `off` govern only a workflow the model chooses to start. Mid-session the model never auto-activates a workflow in `ask` or `auto`; `off` is stated once per session.

**Who sets it.** The team may set a default in the tracked project config; each person overrides it in a file that is never committed, or in an environment variable. Precedence, later wins:

| # | Source | Scope | Where |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Framework default | everyone | `ask` |
| 2 | Tracked project config | team | `docs/project-config.json` → `portability.workflowRouteMode` |
| 3 | Personal file, every project | you | `~/.claude/.ck.json` → `portability.workflowRouteMode` |
| 4 | Personal file, this checkout | you | `.claude/.ck.local.json` → `portability.workflowRouteMode` (git-ignored by `.claude/.gitignore`) |
| 5 | Environment | you, this shell or host | `CK_WORKFLOW_ROUTE_MODE` set to `ask`, `auto` or `off` (`0`, `false`, `no`, `disabled` also mean `off`) |
| 6 | This session | you, this conversation | first line of a prompt: `workflow-mode: ask`, `auto` or `off` (see below) |

The user file is the same `.ck.json` the framework already reads from your home directory. The home directory is `os.homedir()`: `%USERPROFILE%\.claude\.ck.json` on Windows, `$HOME/.claude/.ck.json` on macOS and Linux. A blank, malformed, unreadable or unknown value in any layer is ignored and the next lower layer decides. The tracked `.claude/.ck.json` is never read for this key. With no project config at all, or a project config without the key, nothing above layer 1 applies and the mode is `ask`. Personal layers (3-6) never reach tracked output: the generators read layers 1-2 only.

```json
{ "portability": { "workflowRouteMode": "off" } }
```

Examples: `CK_WORKFLOW_ROUTE_MODE=auto claude` (bash/zsh) or `$env:CK_WORKFLOW_ROUTE_MODE = 'auto'` (PowerShell) for one session; the JSON above in `~/.claude/.ck.json` for every project you work on; in `.claude/.ck.local.json` for one checkout. The legacy boolean `portability.workflowAutoDetect` still works in every file that takes the key: `false` reads as `off`, `true` as `ask`, and `workflowRouteMode` wins when both are present. A team `off` takes effect on the next prompt: the hook reads the project config directly, so nothing needs regenerating.

**In a prompt, or with the skill.** Start a prompt with `workflow-mode: auto` (or `/framework-config --mode=workflow auto`, `$framework-config --mode=workflow auto` on Codex) as its whole first line — only `ask`, `auto` or `off` after the keyword, optionally followed by `save` — and the hook applies that mode to this prompt and the rest of the session (kept in the session's state under `tmp/workflow-routing/`), ahead of every other source when that session state is saved. If session recording fails, the hook applies the mode to this prompt, explicitly reports "session preference NOT saved", and states that later prompts use the recorded/configured mode. With `save` it also writes `~/.claude/.ck.json`; that personal-file result is reported independently and a successful personal save participates in later prompts through the normal preference order. Prose that merely mentions the words, or a directive on a later line or inside a code fence, does nothing. The first task after the directive counts as the session's first task for the workflow rule. The `framework-config --mode=workflow` skill (`/framework-config --mode=workflow [ask|auto|off] [--save] [--local] [--show]`) shows the effective mode and which source decided it, or persists it (`--save` = user file; `--local` = this checkout's file, refused unless git ignores it); `node .claude/scripts/workflow-mode.cjs` does the same from a shell. Every delivered route block, and the off notice, opens with a line `Route mode: <mode> (<source>)`, so the state is visible without the skill. A missing or invalid value anywhere falls back to `ask` and never blocks the hook.

**Hosts.** Claude runs the two route hooks from `.claude/settings.json`; Codex runs them from the mirrored `.codex/hooks.json` (a project hook needs the project trusted and its hash reviewed in `/hooks`); OpenCode runs them through the generated `.opencode/plugins/easy-claude-hooks.js` bridge. All three execute the same files with the same resolver, so the mode behaves identically. A host that runs no hook, or whose hooks are disabled or not yet trusted, delivers no route at all (no root file carries a pointer or fallback): see [Hook-only delivery: host requirements](#hook-only-delivery-host-requirements).

The route is two hook outputs because a host cuts any single output above 10,000 characters to a short preview. Each output is advisory plaintext, never blocks a prompt, is delivered once per session on its own record, and re-arms after a mode or content change, compaction, or about 4.5 MB of transcript growth (the framework proxy for roughly 200K tokens). The gate is always written in full. The catalog output alone is sized to the cap, so its form depends only on the registry: one too large for the compact catalog drops the step-skill names first, then falls back to an index, whatever the length of the gate or of a project route protocol. With routing `off`, or with `portability.skillAutoTrigger` false, no catalog output is sent.

To run a session with the whole framework off — hooks, project instructions and skills — without editing `.claude/`, start `claude --settings .claude/config/vanilla-settings.json --disable-slash-commands` (details and trade-offs: `.claude/config/README.md`).

### Workflow activation tiers

Each `.claude/workflows.json` entry may declare `activation` (default `auto`):

In route mode `ask` (the default; [Workflow route mode](#workflow-route-mode-per-person)) every tier asks the **workflow question** before a catalog workflow the model routes to on its own starts (a direct, single-skill or custom-simple route asks nothing); in mode `auto` the tier decides whether to ask (`auto` never, `confirm` only when a leaner route would also do, `manual` never starts on its own); in mode `off` nothing starts unasked. The tier and the mode are unrelated settings that share the word `auto`. The question is one question offering (a) the full workflow with its step count, (b) a slimmer custom route listing its steps with every required gate kept, (c) direct execution — recommended option first, with a one-line reason. The tier only decides which option is recommended:

| Tier | Recommended option | Enforced by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `auto` | By catalog fit: the full workflow when >80% of its unconditional steps do real work, else the slimmer route | Route gate, `start-workflow` |
| `confirm` | The full workflow only when no leaner route would satisfy the request | Route gate, `start-workflow`; OpenCode `permission.skill` `ask` on the wrapper skill |
| `manual` | Never the full workflow; it runs only when the user picks it or asks for it explicitly | Route gate, `start-workflow`, the wrapper skill's `disable-model-invocation: true` (Claude) and the generated `agents/openai.yaml` `policy.allow_implicit_invocation: false` (Codex) |

Framework defaults: every workflow is tier `auto` except the two heaviest, `workflow-big-feature` and `workflow-greenfield-init`, which are `confirm`. The workflow question is asked on the first task of a session only; mid-session the model neither starts a workflow nor asks to. No framework workflow ships `manual`; a project that wants one opts in with `portability.workflowActivation`. An explicit request (`/workflow-<id>`, `/start-workflow <id>`, `$workflow-<id>` on Codex, or asking in words) runs any tier with no question. Changing a workflow to or from `manual` also means changing its wrapper skill's `disable-model-invocation` — a test fails when the two disagree.

A project can tighten these tiers without forking `workflows.json` through `portability.workflowActivation` in `docs/project-config.json`:

```json
{ "portability": { "workflowActivation": { "default": "confirm", "overrides": { "workflow-bugfix": "auto" } } } }
```

| `portability.workflowActivation` field | Default | Allowed | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `default` | none (framework tiers) | `auto`, `confirm`, `manual` | Floor applied to every workflow: the effective tier is the stricter of this and the framework tier, so it only tightens |
| `overrides` | none | map of workflow id → `auto`, `confirm`, `manual` | Pins one workflow's tier; wins over `default` and the framework tier, so it may loosen |

Tier order is `auto` < `confirm` < `manual`. Omitting the object keeps every framework tier. An unknown tier in either field is a validation error naming the key and `auto|confirm|manual`. A developer may override it in the git-ignored `.claude/.ck.local.json` (same nesting): each setting in `.claude/.ck.local.json` wins over the team value; overrides merge per workflow id, so a local `overrides`-only object keeps the team `default`.

### Custom workflow-route protocol

The route output can carry project-supplied additional route rules via `portability.workflowRouteProtocol`. The team value lives in `docs/project-config.json`; a developer can override it in the git-ignored `.claude/.ck.local.json` (a valid local value replaces the team value). The value is either an inline string or an object `{ "text"?, "path"? }` where `path` is a repo-relative markdown file read at runtime (absolute paths and `..` segments are rejected):

```json
{ "portability": { "workflowRouteProtocol": { "path": "docs/project-protocols/route.md" } } }
```

`workflow-route-inject.cjs` appends the resolved text after the gate in its own marker block (`<!-- CK:WORKFLOW-ROUTE-PROTOCOL -->`), advisory only and never blocking; a protocol never changes the catalog's form. **Keep it to about 3,300 characters or fewer.** The framework never drops or cuts a protocol, but it shares one hook output with the gate, and a host shows one hook output in full only up to 10,000 characters: past that the model gets a short preview, the gate included. With the shipped gate, about 3,300 characters keeps the route output within the 9,500-character cap and about 3,850 takes it past 10,000; the route output then says so on its second line, where the preview still shows it, and names the protocol size that fits. A `path` naming a privacy-sensitive file (`.env`, credentials, secrets, `*.pem`/`*.key`) is refused — the validator rejects it and the runtime treats it as no opinion. The runtime also checks the physically resolved project-relative target, so a public alias cannot expose a private target; aliases to eligible public files remain readable. A file over 20,000 bytes is truncated with a visible marker. It is runtime-only and is never stamped into tracked `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md`/Codex context.

### Just-in-time path rules

When inlined `contextGroups[].rules` push the generated root context past its byte budget, the team can opt out of inlining them in `docs/project-config.json`:

```json
{ "portability": { "inlinePathRules": false } }
```

`SECTION:golden-rules` then names the rule-bearing groups and requires pre-action lookup. Enable `conventionInjection.completeLookup: true` with `conventionInjection.enabled: true` to retrieve **every** matching read/edit class through `node .claude/hooks/lib/file-conventions.cjs --lookup <path>`. Read all returned pages, repeating with `--page N`. Pages stay within 9,500 characters; automatic PostToolUse reminders keep their caps and are only accelerators. This mode also replaces the generated path pre-read table with one pointer.

The generator requires named, unique rule-bearing groups and a library advertising complete lookup support. Older libraries or configurations without this opt-in retain the legacy proof: all rule groups must fit the class cap and worst-case digest size. If either delivery proof fails, rules remain inline and `[WARN] INLINE_PATH_RULES` names the missing precondition. Read `.claude/skills/ai-context-refresh/SKILL.md` when enabling this mode.

For task-scoped config discovery, run `node .claude/scripts/project-context.cjs --context`; add `--section <top-level-key>` for each required section. The loader validates the **entire** config before projection, preserves absent versus explicit-empty reference selection, and resolves relocated config/docs-index paths. Missing config is supported; malformed declarations fail with no projected output. Read the full config when editing it.

### Startup dependency installation

`docs/project-config.json` `hooks.startupInstall` tunes the startup dependency install. Its single
consumer is the registered SessionStart integrity hook `.claude/hooks/verify-install.cjs`, which runs
the install-integrity scan first and then delegates policy to `.claude/hooks/lib/startup-install.cjs`.
The install is attempted only on an explicit `startup` session source and only when the project root
manifest declares dependencies that are not installed; no root manifest, no declared dependencies, or
dependencies already present are clean no-ops. A partial `.claude` bundle reports the repair path
and attempts no install at all.

```json
{
    "hooks": {

| `hooks.startupInstall` field | Type    | Default  | Allowed                              | Meaning                                                                                                   |
| ---------------------------- | ------- | -------- | ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `enabled`                    | boolean | `true`   | boolean                              | `false` disables installation only (outcome `skip-disabled`)                                              |
| `packageManager`             | string  | `"auto"` | `auto`, `npm`, `pnpm`, `yarn`, `bun` | One manager **signal**, never a precedence override                                                       |
| `allowLifecycleScripts`      | boolean | `false`  | boolean                              | A repository **request** only — effective solely with the `CK_STARTUP_INSTALL_TRUST=1` host grant (below) |

**The section and every property in it are optional.** An omitted property keeps the portable default,
and the defaults are identical whether the property, the whole `hooks` section, or the entire
`docs/project-config.json` file is absent: `enabled: true`, `packageManager: "auto"`,
`allowLifecycleScripts: false`. A project that declares nothing behaves exactly as it did before the
section existed, so declare it only to record a needed non-default.

**A declared `packageManager` is a signal, not an override.** A non-`auto` value joins the other
available signals — the root manifest's Corepack `packageManager` field, `project.packageManagers`,
every recognized root lockfile, and a detected Yarn PnP install — and all of them must resolve to one
manager (and to at most one pinned version) or the install fails closed with `skip-manager-conflict`
and runs nothing. Declaring `"npm"` in a project carrying `pnpm-lock.yaml` therefore installs nothing;
it does not switch the project to npm. With no signal at all the historical `npm` fallback applies.

**Disabling installation never disables integrity verification.** `enabled: false` short-circuits the
install only; `verify-install.cjs` still scans the `.claude` bundle for missing hook files and
transitive requires, and still reports a partial copy.

**The manager executable and its arguments are not configurable — by design.** No config key can
supply a command, a flag, or a path. The hook only ever runs a fixed, version-matched argv taken from
its own support matrix, so no project config can turn the startup hook into an arbitrary command
runner, under a fixed 120-second deadline for the manager process. That closed argv is what makes
this section safe to expose at all. `allowLifecycleScripts: true` only removes the suppression
argument that matrix row already defines (`--ignore-scripts`, `--skip-builds`, or
`--mode=skip-build`); it grants nothing else, manager-native policy such as Bun's
`trustedDependencies` still governs dependency scripts, and a project-loaded manager extension
(a `pnpmfile`, `YARN_PLUGINS`, a `.yarnrc` `yarn-path`) skips the install regardless of the opt-in.

**`allowLifecycleScripts: true` needs a second, host-side signal to do anything.** A repository can
only REQUEST unsuppressed scripts; the environment variable `CK_STARTUP_INSTALL_TRUST=1` is the grant,
and the effective value is `allowLifecycleScripts === true && CK_STARTUP_INSTALL_TRUST === '1'`. This
is deliberate: a checked-in config travels with a clone, so it must not be able to authorize running a
dependency's install scripts on a machine whose owner never agreed to that. Without the grant the
install still proceeds with suppression intact — so the failure mode of setting only the config key is
SILENT (you get `--ignore-scripts` anyway, and the diagnostic vocabulary has no code for "request not
granted"). Grant it per machine in `.claude/settings.local.json`, which is git-ignored:

```json
{
    "env": {
        "CK_STARTUP_INSTALL_TRUST": "1"
    }
}
```

The same grant has a **second effect that is easy to miss**: without it the runner sanitizes the
manager's child environment — known registry-credential variables are stripped and npm's user and
global config paths are pointed at a credential-free device path, so an ambient `.npmrc` cannot be
read. Granting trust stops that sanitization, which is what lets a private-registry install
authenticate, and equally what exposes those credentials to whatever lifecycle scripts now run. Grant
it when a project genuinely needs built native dependencies or a private registry at session start;
leave it ungranted otherwise.

**Supported breadth.** Managers `npm`, `pnpm`, `yarn`, `bun` across the matrix rows `npm@10-11`,
`npm@12`, `pnpm@9.15.0`, `pnpm@12`, `yarn@1`, `yarn@2.4`, `yarn@3-4`, `bun@1.2`; recognized root
lockfiles `package-lock.json` and `npm-shrinkwrap.json` (npm), `pnpm-lock.yaml` (pnpm), `yarn.lock`
(yarn), `bun.lock` and `bun.lockb` (bun); platforms `win32`, `linux`, `darwin`. A manager version
outside the matrix, an ambiguous lockfile pair, a lockfile that is recognized but unsupported on the
installed version (npm 12 with only `npm-shrinkwrap.json`, Bun 1.2 with only the legacy `bun.lockb`),
an unsupported platform, or a Corepack shim all skip instead of guessing — a pinned dependency graph is
never reinterpreted as lockless.

**Config states.** An absent config file uses the defaults above. An invalid config file skips
installation with `skip-config-invalid`, and a config loader that cannot be loaded at all skips with
`skip-config-unavailable` — it fails closed rather than falling through to the enabled default, because
an adopter's explicit disablement cannot be established. Diagnostics are one-line, fixed-vocabulary
strings on stderr; they never echo a path, a config value, or manager output, and most skips are silent
no-ops.

Validate with `node .claude/hooks/lib/project-config-schema.cjs --validate docs/project-config.json`
(`--describe` prints the authoritative field list). Hook-side details:
[../hooks/README.md](../hooks/README.md).

### Code graph switch

`docs/project-config.json` `hooks.codeGraph.enabled` decides whether the code-graph hooks and CLI run:

| Value | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `"auto"` (default) | Active only when `.code-graph/graph.db` exists |
| `"on"` | Always active |
| `"off"` | Graph hooks stay silent and the graph CLI refuses to run |

Omitting the key or the `codeGraph` object means `"auto"`. Any other value is a validation error naming `auto|on|off`.

### Token checkpoint

> **Read by `token-budget-checkpoint.cjs`.** The checkpoint hook (PostToolUse on `TodoWrite|TaskCreate|TaskUpdate|update_plan`, main conversation only) reads `hooks.tokenBudget` on every task/plan step and counts the session's main and sub-agent Claude transcripts. On a host whose transcript it cannot read, it stays silent. A malformed section keeps the checkpoint off until the config is fixed. Claude users can also check spend with `/context`.

`docs/project-config.json` `hooks.tokenBudget` tunes an advisory checkpoint at task/plan step boundaries: each time the session's non-cached tokens (input + cache creation + output; cache reads never count) cross the next multiple of `checkpointTokens`, the model gets one note suggesting a progress report and asking whether to continue. It never blocks.

```json
{ "hooks": { "tokenBudget": { "enabled": true, "checkpointTokens": 500000 } } }
```

| `hooks.tokenBudget` field | Type    | Default  | Allowed             | Meaning                              |
| ------------------------- | ------- | -------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `enabled`                 | boolean | `true`   | boolean             | `false` turns the note off           |
| `checkpointTokens`        | integer | `500000` | 50000–20000000      | Non-cached tokens between two notes  |

A `checkpointTokens` value outside the range, or not a whole number, is a validation error naming the key and the range.

### Commit `Fix-Origin` trailer

`docs/project-config.json` `commit.fixOriginTrailer` (boolean, default `false`) opts a project into the author-declared `Fix-Origin: <feedback|regression|not-applicable>` trailer. When `true`, the `commit` skill writes it on new commits only; existing commits are never reworded to add it. When omitted or `false`, commit messages carry no `Fix-Origin` trailer.

### Pull-request target branch

`docs/project-config.json` `pullRequest.targetBranch` (string, default `main`) is the base branch the `pull-request` skill branches from and opens PRs into. Two things take precedence over it: a base branch named in the request, and the base of a PR already open for the current branch. When omitted, the skill uses `main`.

### Configure without knowing JSON keys

Ask “How do these .claude skills work?”, “What can I configure in this .codex framework?” or
“Disable automatic heavy skills for this checkout”. The `framework-config` skill selects automatically
from its description and handles framework help plus show/explain/set/reset. Explicit commands:
`/framework-config` (Claude/OpenCode), `$framework-config` (Codex).

Questions are read-only. Changes default to checkout scope; say “for every project” for your user
preference or “for the team” for the project default. Existing JSON is merged and validated, and reset
removes only the selected layer’s key. This helper remains eligible when heavy auto-trigger is off and
in the minimal visibility preset, unless you explicitly impose a native permission override.

### Skill auto-trigger (runtime, per developer)

Set `portability.skillAutoTrigger: false` to ask before starting a suitable matched framework skill: run
the skill, or skip it and execute directly. Named user requests and required hook/protocol calls stay
callable. Default: `true` (today's behavior). This treats **all framework skills and workflow wrappers as heavy except `commit`,
`pull-request` and the lightweight `framework-config` help/configuration entry**; personal, bundled and third-party skills are outside its scope.

```json
{ "portability": { "skillAutoTrigger": false } }
```

Place this in the configured project config (default `docs/project-config.json`, overridden by
`.claude/.ck.json` `portability.projectConfigPath`) for the team, `~/.claude/.ck.json` for yourself
across projects, or git-ignored `.claude/.ck.local.json` for this checkout. Later valid values win:
default → team → user → checkout-local → `CK_SKILL_AUTO_TRIGGER`. Environment values accept
`0/false/off/no/disabled` and `1/true/on/yes/enabled`; config values must be actual booleans.
Use `true` to override a team `false`. Missing, malformed and invalid layers express no opinion.
The hook reads effective preferences at runtime; changing this preference needs **no regeneration**.

Restricted mode distinguishes **selection** from **execution**:

- Ordinary “fix this”, “review these changes” or “implement this” prompts do not authorize a matching
  heavy skill by themselves. If a suitable skill matches, the assistant names it, explains its fit and
  asks once: **Run the matched skill** or **Skip the skill and execute directly**. It waits for your
  answer. Confirmation authorizes that skill and its scoped dependencies; Skip proceeds directly
  with required quality/safety checks and no replacement skill. The same task is not asked again on
  follow-up, delegation or resume. With no suitable match, the assistant executes directly without
  a question. Explicit named requests and already authorized steps need no skill-choice question.
- An operation-specific hook/protocol may require a named skill for an operation already active.
  Once an authorized skill/workflow starts, its required dependencies remain eligible. Optional
  suggestions, generic discovery guidance and self-starting a preloaded agent do not qualify.
- Both `commit` and `pull-request` use `commit` → **Test and review decision policy**: they never ask whether to run tests or review. Tests are skipped only when the affected tests already passed in the session for unchanged content or the change is really small; otherwise scoped tests run and failures are fixed until all pass. Review is skipped only for a low-risk candidate; medium risk runs `why-review` and high risk runs `changes-review`, each as a fix loop of at most two review rounds. Findings still open at that cap stop the operation uncommitted with a report. Changed content needs fresh evidence, not an old Skip. An explicit instruction about tests or review overrides the automatic choice, and the selected review
  can run its required reviewers, findings validation and fix loop as written.
  The auto-trigger preference does not decide tests/review, approve Skip, or grant Git authority; the skill decision policy owns those decisions.
- The competing automatic workflow catalog is suppressed. Existing workflow-route restrictions and
  native permissions/manual-only skills remain in force.

The same `skill-activation-inject.cjs` emits the full policy on every restricted prompt, delegated
start and recovery. It never substitutes a presence-based reminder. Isolated agent reset state records
confirmed writes only; missing storage and failed output leave the next full replay eligible.
Codex mirrors the runtime producer; OpenCode refreshes it at system-context
transformation for main and child sessions and discards cached startup copies of this policy.
Restoring auto mode emits a reset in scopes that previously received the restriction, then stays silent.

**Why not the native manual-only flags?** Claude's `disable-model-invocation`/user-only overrides and
OpenCode's skill `deny` can reject model calls, including hook-directed calls. Codex documents explicit
user invocation with `allow_implicit_invocation: false`, but no portable hook exception. This switch
therefore changes no frontmatter, `agents/openai.yaml`, `skillOverrides` or `permission.skill` entries.
Existing `skillProfile` settings may still block a requested call; this mode does not override them.

**Enforcement limit:** this is an assistant-selection instruction, not a hard access-control boundary.
Skills remain discoverable, so it reduces unsolicited procedure execution rather than catalog context
size. Adapter tests prove policy delivery and preserved call paths; they do not prove every model obeys
the instruction on every turn. Hosts must run the framework hooks (and OpenCode its generated bridge).

An explicitly requested workflow also authorizes its required and selected applicable skill steps within the declared workflow scope, recorded in a todo/task plan, including later or resumed execution and their required nested calls. A plan created from ordinary task wording cannot authorize a heavy workflow by itself.

### Skill profile

`docs/project-config.json` `skillProfile` sets, for the whole team, which skills the model sees. `preset` picks a base from `.claude/config/skill-profiles.json`: `full` (no overrides), `standard` (skills other skills or hooks start leave the model's list but stay callable by name), or `minimal` (only the entry skills stay listed). The lists `nameOnly`, `commandOnly` (only a user's `/name` starts it) and `off` (skill folder names; one list per skill) apply on top of the preset.

Apply it with `node .claude/scripts/sync-skill-profile.cjs` (`--check` is read-only). The guard refuses, and writes nothing, when `commandOnly` or `off` would hide a called skill — one a workflow step or an agent `skills:` entry starts, or one on the curated `calledByOthers` or `entrySkills` list (the workflow runner and the setup skills that gates and hooks start) — unless `allowHidingCalledSkills: true`. `nameOnly` is allowed for any skill. Read `.claude/config/README.md#skill-profile` when you need the per-host effect (Claude `skillOverrides`, Codex, OpenCode), the ownership ledger, or the fail-closed inputs.

### workflows.json

**Purpose:** Canonical workflow definitions and execution metadata. Use the route mode (`portability.workflowRouteMode`, [Workflow route mode](#workflow-route-mode-per-person)) to choose how a matched workflow starts or to turn automatic routing off, and a workflow's `activation` tier ([Workflow activation tiers](#workflow-activation-tiers)) to choose which option the workflow question recommends.

```json
{
    "version": "2.4.0",
    "workflows": {
        "feature": {
            "sequence": ["plan", "feature-implement", "test", "code-quality-review", "docs-manager --mode=update"],
            "whenToUse": "User wants to implement new functionality"
        }
    }
}
```

**Schema:** Each workflow entry supports `activation`, `defaultMode`, `description`, `intent`, `name`, `outcomeGates`, `parallelGroups`, `preActions`, `sequence`, `stepMeta`, `variants`, `whenToUse` (`WorkflowEntry` in `.claude/workflows.schema.json`). `variants` holds one complete `sequence` per mode (plus optional `parallelGroups`, `stepMeta` and `outcomeGates`), `defaultMode` names the default mode, and a variant's own `outcomeGates` are added to the entry-level `outcomeGates` that every mode shares. There are NO `priority` or `triggers` properties. When runtime routing is enabled, the model semantically matches the prompt against `whenToUse`; otherwise the catalog remains available only through explicitly invoked workflow skills.

**Live catalog (19 workflows):** `workflow-big-feature`, `workflow-bugfix`, `workflow-e2e`, `workflow-feature`, `workflow-implement-spec`, `workflow-feature-spec`, `workflow-greenfield-init`, `workflow-initiative-to-task`, `workflow-initiative-to-spec`, `workflow-refactor`, `workflow-research`, `workflow-review-changes`, `workflow-architecture-audit`, `workflow-code-to-spec`, `workflow-spec-to-task`, `workflow-spec-to-mockup`, `workflow-spec-sync`, `workflow-seed-test-data`, `workflow-integration-test`.

| `workflow-review-changes` | triage → [parallel: changes-review + whole-target why-review] → triage-selected `--report-only` specialists (`integration-test --mode=review --prove-tests` always runs unless a parent passes `--tests=defer`, the verify-last order) → validate findings → `fix --target=review` → code-simplifier → post-fix whole-target why-review (conditional on fixes) → docs-manager --mode=update → workflow-end | Review uncommitted changes before committing      |

### .mcp.json

**Purpose:** Model Context Protocol server integrations.

```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "github": {
            "command": "npx",
            "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"],

### opencode.json (recommended defaults)

**Purpose:** opencode's project config. The framework ships recommended defaults and reconciles them into each consuming project through `/sync-opencode`.

| Item                                           | Path                                                                                                  |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Source of truth (edit this to change defaults) | `.opencode/opencode.recommended.json`                                                                 |
| Generated target (created/updated by the sync) | `<project-root>/opencode.json`                                                                        |
| Writer / verifier                              | `.claude/scripts/opencode/sync-config.mjs` (`--check` verifies)                                       |
| Sub-agent mirror source of truth               | `.claude/agents/*.md`                                                                                 |
| Sub-agent mirror target (generated)            | `.opencode/agent/<name>.md` — one per canonical agent, `mode: subagent` + the canonical body verbatim |
| Sub-agent mirror writer / verifier             | `.claude/scripts/opencode/sync-agents.mjs` (`--check` verifies)                                       |

**To update a default recommended opencode setting:** edit `.opencode/opencode.recommended.json` and run `/sync-opencode` (or `node .claude/skills/sync-opencode/scripts/run-opencode-sync.mjs`). The `config` stage deep-merges the recommended defaults into the project-root `opencode.json` — recommended keys win at every leaf, project-only keys survive untouched, and a project with no root config receives the recommended defaults verbatim. A malformed existing root config is reported, never clobbered.

**Adopting the framework in a new project:** copy the `.opencode/` folder (including `opencode.recommended.json`) plus `.claude/`, then run `/sync-opencode` to generate/update the project's root `opencode.json`, the hooks bridge, the `.opencode/agent/*.md` sub-agent mirror, the `permission.skill` entries and the `.opencode/commands/<name>.md` files. Do NOT copy `.opencode/skill-permissions.generated.json` (the skill-permission ownership ledger) or `.opencode/commands/`: both are generated per project. The ledger records its project's name (`project.name` from the project config, default `docs/project-config.json`), so a ledger copied from another project is ignored and treated as empty.

**No compaction pin (all three surfaces):**

The portable bundle sets no auto-compaction budget on any host, so each host compacts at its own default and each person picks their own value. Keep a personal budget in personal or local config, never in a file the bundle ships to the whole team.

| Surface     | Host default (no pin)                                                                                          | Set your own                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| Codex       | Codex's own default                                                                                            | `model_auto_compact_token_limit` in `~/.codex/config.toml`, or top-level in the project `.codex/config.toml`                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| opencode    | The model's registry window; the bundled model declares a 1M `context` and 384K `output`, so it compacts at 968,000 | `provider.<id>.models.<model>.limit` in the project-root `opencode.json` or your global opencode config                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

**Retiring the old pin.** Earlier bundles pinned 500K on every host. `/sync-codex` removes a top-level `model_auto_compact_token_limit` from `.codex/config.toml` only when its value is exactly `500000`, along with the bundled comment block above it when that block is unchanged. `/sync-opencode` removes the pinned model's `limit` from the root `opencode.json` only when it is exactly `{ "context": 500000, "output": 384000 }`. Any other value belongs to the user: the sync keeps it and prints one `kept user-set …` line. A personal 500K budget should therefore live in user-level config (`~/.codex/config.toml`, the global opencode config), where no sync looks.

**Codex `AGENTS.md` read budget:** the same upsert raises top-level `project_doc_max_bytes` to 98304 in `.codex/config.toml` (a larger project value is kept). Codex silently stops reading `AGENTS.md` at 32 KiB by default, and the generated root is larger; the projection orders Doc Lookup and the project rules first so they survive the default window if the host ignores the project key (set it in `~/.codex/config.toml` then). The budget is shared by every `AGENTS.md` Codex concatenates from the project root down to the working directory, so nested `AGENTS.md` files eat into the root's share.

opencode has no absolute compaction threshold — it compacts relative to the model's declared window, so a `limit.context` you set is the knob (it compacts at `limit.context - min(limit.output, 32000)`). `compaction.reserved` is inert for this model: opencode reads it only for models that declare `limit.input`. Read the `sync-opencode` skill ("Compaction: host default") for the exact formula before setting your own `limit`.

> `.opencode/opencode.recommended.json` MUST NOT be renamed to `.opencode/opencode.json`: opencode auto-loads that path as project config, so it would stop being a template.

**See:** the `sync-opencode` skill for the full stage roster and merge/portability contract.

## Quick Configuration Guide

### Enable/Disable Features

```json
// .ck.json
{
  "promptLedger": { "enabled": false },      // Disable prompt-ledger recording
  "commitSkillRoute": { "enabled": false },        // Disable the commit-skill prompt router
  "judgementIntegrityRoute": { "enabled": false }, // Disable the judgement-integrity prompt router
  "aiFeatureRoute": { "enabled": false }           // Disable the AI-feature prompt router
}

// settings.json
{
  "enabledPlugins": {
    "playwright@claude-plugins-official": false  // Disable plugin
  }
}
```

### Store Active Project Rules

Keep tracked `.claude` defaults project-neutral. Put path-specific conventions in
`docs/project-config.json` `contextGroups` and authoritative detail in the
referenced project docs. `.ck.json.assertions` is retained for compatibility,
but its values are not injected into the standard prompt context.

### Tailor AI-feature review to a project

The AI-engineering gate ships project-neutral. A project adds its own rules only through these routes, never by editing `.claude/skills/shared/protocols/ai-*.md`, the `ai-engineering-review` skill or the reviewer agent:

| Need | Route |
| --- | --- |
| Which files are AI surface (an internal LLM wrapper, prompt folders, another SDK) and the short rules or docs delivered with them | Declare a `contextGroups` class named `ai-feature-gate` in `docs/project-config.json` (at least one include matcher, then `pathRegexes`, `contentRegexes`, `rules`, `referenceDocs`). It replaces the built-in class for the per-file hook and `ai-signal-scan.cjs` (`classSource: config`). |
| Provider, approved models, data boundary, risk tier, eval thresholds | Record them in an ADR or a project reference doc listed in the docs index or `referenceDocs`. Project policy outranks the `AE-*` clauses, and the review records `Project policy read: <paths>`. |
| An extra review rule for one skill (for example a house eval threshold for `ai-engineering-review`) | `/project-skill-protocol add` — an additive overlay that can never waive the gate. |
| Turn the prompt reminder off | `.claude/.ck.json` `aiFeatureRoute.enabled: false` or `CK_AI_FEATURE_ROUTE=0`. |

Validate with `node .claude/hooks/lib/project-config-schema.cjs --validate docs/project-config.json`. A matcher change alters the class's content tag, so regenerate `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` afterwards.

### Customize Plan Naming

```json
// .ck.json
{
    "plan": {
        "namingFormat": "{date}-{issue}-{slug}",
        "dateFormat": "YYMMDD-HHmm",
        "issuePrefix": "GH-"
    }
}
```

### Add Tool Permissions

```json
// settings.json
{
    "permissions": {
        "allow": ["Bash(docker:*)"],
        "deny": ["Bash(rm -rf /*)"],
        "ask": ["Bash(git push:*)"]
    }
}
```

## Configuration Inheritance

Configuration is loaded in order with later files overriding earlier:

1. **Claude Code defaults** - Built-in settings
2. **User settings** - `~/.claude/settings.json`
3. **Project settings** - `.claude/settings.json`
4. **Session settings** - Runtime modifications

---

## Environment Variables

Set a personal switch as an `env` entry in the git-ignored `.claude/settings.local.json`, or in your shell.

| Variable                                | Purpose                                                                                                                              |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR`                    | Project root directory, set by the host and used in hook commands                                                                    |
| `CK_DEBUG`                              | `1` or `true`: framework hooks print diagnostics to stderr (`.claude/hooks/lib/debug-log.cjs`)                                       |
| `CLAUDE_HOOK_DEBUG`                     | `1` or `true`: hooks append a lifecycle trace (no transcript text) to a log file, rotated at 1 MB, keeping one backup                                     |
| `CLAUDE_HOOK_DEBUG_LOG`                 | Path of that trace file; default `<os temp>/ck/debug/bash-hooks.log`                                                                 |
| `CK_NO_AUTO_OPEN`                       | `1`: HTML reports (`watzup`, `understand`) print their path instead of opening, and `task-track` `serve --open` starts no browser; nothing opens under `CI` or headless Linux either |
| `CK_AUTO_INSTALL_DEPENDENCIES`          | `0`, `off` or `false`: no automatic dependency install (catalog tooling's PyYAML recovery, the `task-track` pinned package); the tool refuses with the by-hand command instead |
| `CK_STARTUP_INSTALL_TRUST`              | `1`: host grant that lets `hooks.startupInstall.allowLifecycleScripts: true` take effect (see [Startup dependency installation](#startup-dependency-installation)) |
| `CK_PROMPT_LEDGER`                      | `0` / `false` / `off` / `no`: turns the session prompt ledger off, like `promptLedger.enabled: false` in `.ck.json`                  |
| `CK_PROMPT_LEDGER_DIR`                  | Directory for prompt-ledger records instead of `<project>/tmp/prompt-ledger`                                                         |
| `CK_COMMIT_SKILL_ROUTE`                 | `0`: stops the reminder to commit through the `commit` skill, like `commitSkillRoute.enabled: false`                                 |
| `CK_JUDGEMENT_INTEGRITY_ROUTE`          | `0`: stops the judgement-integrity reminder, like `judgementIntegrityRoute.enabled: false`                                           |
| `CK_AI_FEATURE_ROUTE`                   | `0`: stops the AI-feature (AI-engineering gate) reminder, like `aiFeatureRoute.enabled: false`                                       |
| `DOC_SYNC_OVERRIDE`                     | `1`: silences the doc-sync commit warning (the gate only warns, never blocks); each use is appended to the gate's audit log            |
| `ENABLE_DESKTOP_NOTIFICATIONS`          | `false`: turns off desktop turn-complete alerts (on by default)                                                                     |
| `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` / `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` / `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` + `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` | Setting one turns on turn-complete alerts in that chat channel; setup: `.claude/hooks/notifications/docs/` |
| `PYTHON_PATH`                           | Python executable tried first when session start detects the Python version                                                          |
| `OPENCODE_DISABLE_CLAUDE_CODE_SKILLS`   | `1` when starting OpenCode: it stops loading `.claude/skills` for that session                                                       |
| `GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN`          | GitHub MCP server auth                                                                                                               |

## Permission Configuration

### Allowlist Patterns

```json
{
    "permissions": {
        "allow": ["Tool/**", "Tool(pattern:*)", "Bash(npm:*)", "Bash(git commit:*)", "Read(src/**)", "Write(src/**, !*.secret)"]
    }
}
```

### Common Permission Sets

**Read-only development:**

```json
{
    "permissions": {
        "allow": ["Read/**", "Glob/**", "Grep/**"],
        "deny": ["Write/**", "Edit/**", "Bash(rm:*)"]
    }
}
```

**Full development access:**

```json
{
    "permissions": {
        "allow": ["Read/**", "Write/**", "Edit/**", "Glob/**", "Grep/**", "Bash(npm:*)", "Bash(git:*)", "Bash(node:*)"]
    }
}
```

## Hook Configuration

### Event Types

| Event              | When Triggered            |
| ------------------ | ------------------------- |
| `SessionStart`     | Session begins            |
| `UserPromptSubmit` | User sends message        |
| `PreToolUse`       | Before tool execution     |
| `PostToolUse`      | After tool execution      |
| `Stop`             | Response complete         |
| `PreCompact`       | Before context compaction |
| `SessionEnd`       | Session ends              |
| `SubagentStart`    | Subagent spawning         |
| `UserPromptExpansion` | Typed `/command` expands |
| `Notification`     | Idle/waiting events       |

> These are the Claude Code events available for hooks. This framework registers no `PreCompact` hook. `SubagentStart` and `UserPromptExpansion` carry only protocol-delivery handlers: `SubagentStart` the five `protocol-inject-<group>.cjs` group handlers (full protocol texts for skill-preloading agents) and the four `protocol-inject-universal-<n>.cjs` bins (the universal bundle, to every agent type; the bins are also registered on `UserPromptSubmit` and on `SessionStart` with matcher `compact|clear`); `UserPromptExpansion` the five group handlers and `skill-overlay-remind.cjs` for typed `/command` skills. Standing sub-agent context stays static in `agents/*.md`. Read `../hooks/README.md` when you need the per-event registration counts.

### Hook Structure

```json
{
    "hooks": {
        "EventName": [
            {
                "matcher": "ToolPattern",
                "hooks": [
                    {
                        "type": "command",
                        "command": "node .claude/hooks/hook.cjs",
                        "timeout": 60
                    }
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

### Matcher Patterns

| Pattern               | Matches                |
| --------------------- | ---------------------- |
| `"Write"`             | Exact tool name        |
| `"Write\|Edit"`       | Multiple tools (regex) |
| `"*"` or `""`         | All tools              |
| `"mcp__server__tool"` | MCP tool               |

## Common Customizations

### Adding a New MCP Server

```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "my-server": {
            "command": "npx",
            "args": ["-y", "@my/mcp-server"],
            "env": { "API_KEY": "${MY_API_KEY}" }
        }
    }
}
```

### Adding a Custom Hook

```json
{
    "hooks": {
        "PostToolUse": [
            {
                "matcher": "Write|Edit",
                "hooks": [
                    {
                        "type": "command",
                        "command": "node .claude/hooks/my-custom-hook.cjs",
                        "timeout": 30
                    }
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Configuration Not Applied

1. Check file syntax: `node -e "console.log(JSON.parse(require('fs').readFileSync('.claude/settings.json')))"`
2. Verify file location
3. Check for local override in settings.local.json
4. Restart Claude Code session

### Hook Not Running

1. Check matcher pattern matches tool
2. Verify hook script exists
3. Check timeout setting
4. Run hook manually: `echo '{}' | node .claude/hooks/hook.cjs`

### Permission Denied

1. Check allow patterns match file path
2. Check for deny patterns overriding
3. Verify glob syntax

## Closing reminders

**MUST** keep project facts in the configured project-config file and machine permission in personal/ignored local policy. **MUST** validate declared settings and retain native host permissions. **MUST** resolve required review evidence and rule errors before acceptance.
