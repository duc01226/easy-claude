# Primary Workflow

## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Define the standard development workflow phases and map them to the workflow catalog in `.claude/workflows.json`.

**Core Phases (all workflows follow subsets of these):**

1. **Discover** — Use `/investigate` to locate files and inspect patterns
2. **Plan** — `/plan` (add `/plan --mode=validate` when decisions need user confirmation; `/plan --mode=review` only on explicit request or inside the big workflows), save in the plans root (default `plans/`; a `docsRoots.plans.path` entry in `docs/project-config.json` overrides the path)
3. **Design Review** — `/why-review`; spec and test-spec work follows the project's configured spec-artifact profile or documented native spec contract
4. **Implement** — `/feature-implement` or `/plan --mode=execute`, compile-check after every file change
5. **Verify** — `/test`, `/integration-test`, and any spec reconciliation step defined by the selected project profile
6. **Quality** — Use `workflow-review-changes` for the canonical review and repair cycle; follow its registered sequence in `.claude/workflows.json`. It invokes the `changes-review` skill as one part of the workflow.
7. **Ship** — `/production-readiness-review`, `/security-audit`, `/docs-manager --mode=update`, `/watzup`, `/workflow-end`

**Key Rules:**

- Understand code FIRST before any modification — mandatory, no exceptions
- Compile-check after every code change
- Never use fake data or mocks just to pass tests
- Activate relevant skills from catalog during the process
- Every claim needs `file:line` evidence, confidence >80% to act

---

**IMPORTANT:** Analyze the skills catalog and activate the skills that are needed for the task during the process.
**IMPORTANT:** Ensure token efficiency while maintaining high quality.

## Phase 0: Understand Code First (MANDATORY)

> **Understand-Code-First** — Do NOT write code, create plans, or attempt fixes until you READ existing code.
> Search 3+ similar implementations first. Optional: for a high-risk blast radius that grep may miss, the code graph (when its database exists) can add callers and dependents; it may be stale, so verify by reading the files.

- Read existing code before modifying. Validate assumptions with evidence. Search before creating.

## Phase 1: Planning

- Use `/plan` skill to create an implementation plan with tasks in the plans root (default `plans/`; a `docsRoots.plans.path` entry in `docs/project-config.json` overrides the path)
- Use `/web-research` → `/source-deep-dive` for investigating technical topics before planning
- Confirm plan decisions via `/plan --mode=validate` (critical questions) when needed; `/plan --mode=review` is a single pass, never automatic, and only `workflow-big-feature` and `workflow-greenfield-init` include it
- **DO NOT** create new enhanced files — update existing files directly

## Phase 2: Design Review

- Use `/why-review` to validate design rationale before implementation
- Before spec or test-spec work, resolve the project's configured spec-artifact profile or documented native spec contract
- Use `/spec [mode=tests]`, `/work-item --mode=review --type=spec-tests`, and a Feature Spec Section 8 CREATE-before-implementation / UPDATE-after lifecycle only when the selected profile defines that format; otherwise follow its native artifact, identifier, and review contract
- Every assertion-bearing test uses explicit `Given` → `When` → `Then` phases, names the guarded business intent/invariant or technical contract, and asserts an owned outcome; framework-native BDD, named helpers, or comments are valid, while bare Arrange/Act/Assert is insufficient unless all three GWT phases are also labeled
- Every `changes-review` skill invocation or specialist review first applies `SYNC:review-principle-awareness`; route only contextually applicable scale-ready foundation, GWT test, AI-agent-as-user, and UI/component obligations to their detailed skill protocols, recording evidence-backed N/A/defer/block/unverified status rather than inventing findings or expanding scope
- Large features (`workflow-big-feature`): two plans — PLAN1 (architecture) then PLAN2 (incorporating test strategy); other feature routes use one plan

## Phase 3: Implementation

- Use `/feature-implement` or `/plan --mode=execute` skill to implement the plan
- Write clean, readable, maintainable code
- Follow the project's documented architecture, state-management, and styling conventions; load the project references that apply to the changed area
- Handle edge cases and error scenarios
- **[IMPORTANT]** After creating or modifying code, run compile command to check for errors

## Phase 4: Verification

- Use `/test` skill to run tests and analyze results
- Use `/integration-test` to generate integration tests from specs
- Reconcile affected spec/test-spec artifacts according to the selected project's profile or native contract; use `/spec [mode=sync]` only when that profile defines the mode or dashboard format
- **Bugfixes:** where the selected project's integration-test protocol requires a regression test, establish the failing behavior before `/fix` (RED) and verify it passes after the fix (GREEN). Production-code changes go through `workflow-review-changes`; it uses the `changes-review` skill. The standalone `/fix` route runs that skill before `/why-review` — see `workflow-bugfix/SKILL.md` and `fix/SKILL.md`
- **IMPORTANT:** Never use fake data, mocks, cheats, or tricks just to pass the build
- **IMPORTANT:** Fix failing tests and re-run until all pass

## Phase 5: Quality

- Use `workflow-review-changes` for the canonical review and repair workflow; follow its registered sequence and severity bar. Use the standalone `changes-review` skill only when a standalone review is the selected task.
- Alternatively use individual skills: `/code-simplifier`, `/code-quality-review`, `/architecture --mode=review`, `/performance-review`
- Follow coding standards and conventions
- Optimize for performance and maintainability

## Phase 6: Ship

- Use `/production-readiness-review` for production readiness (service-layer/API changes)
- Use `/security-audit` for security review
- Use `/docs-manager --mode=update` to update documentation if needed
- Use `/watzup` for summary report of all changes
- Use `/workflow-end` to clear workflow state

## Phase 7: Debugging (when issues arise)

- Use `/investigate --mode=debug` for systematic debugging when issues are reported
- For non-trivial bugs, failed verification, or stale/incorrect final outputs, start from the observed end state and trace backward through reader -> storage/projection -> writer -> consumer/job -> producer/origin before proposing a fix
- Enumerate every feeder path and root-cause hypothesis; a fix is blocked until the owning fix layer and forward convergence proof are written
- Use `/fix` skill to apply fixes after root cause is identified
- Re-run tests after every fix to verify no regressions

## Workflow Catalog Reference

`.claude/workflows.json` is the execution authority for workflow IDs, steps, and conditions. The IDs below are a routing index checked against the current catalog; update this index when the catalog changes.

### Core Development Workflows

| Workflow ID                   | When to use                                                                         |

## Closing Reminders

**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** understand existing code FIRST (read and search 3+ patterns) before ANY code modification
**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** compile-check after every code file change
**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** never use fake data/mocks/cheats just to pass tests — fix real issues
**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** activate relevant skills from catalog during the process
**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** match the best-fitting workflow from the catalog; only when your route is to start it, ask the one workflow question (full workflow · slimmer custom route · execute directly, recommended first) and activate the user's pick via `/start-workflow <workflowId>`; an explicit workflow request skips the question
**Optional advice:** for a high-risk blast radius grep may miss, the code graph (when its database exists) can add callers, dependents and impacted tests; it may be stale, so verify by reading the files. Never required; an absent graph is never a finding.
