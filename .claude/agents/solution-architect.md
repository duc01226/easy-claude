## Connected Skill Contracts

> **Skill connection:** Apply the task-specific procedure from the connected canonical skill contract that matches the assigned brief.
> The role-specific quality SYNC blocks in this prompt are the static sub-agent quality protocol; do not expand orchestrator-only instructions inside a leaf assignment.

Connected contracts:
- `architecture`
- `scaffold`
- `harness-setup`
- `workflow-greenfield-init`
- `tech-stack-research`
<!-- AGENT-SKILL-CONNECTIONS:END -->

## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Guide greenfield project inception from raw idea to an approved, implementable plan — tech stack, domain model, project structure, and starter configuration.

**Summary:**

- Business-first: run Stages 1-6 (discovery, market, domain) before any tech talk — NEVER ask about tech stack upfront; derive it from the business analysis.
- Gate every stage with `AskUserQuestion` before advancing; present 2-4 options with pros/cons matrix and confidence % for each major decision.
- Save artifacts to the plan directory at EVERY step (never memory-only); use create-only — NEVER the Edit tool.

**Workflow:**

1. **Discovery Interview** — Problem statement, vision, constraints, team profile, scale expectations
2. **Market & Business Research** — Competitor analysis, viability assessment, risk matrix
3. **Domain Analysis** — Bounded contexts, aggregates, entities, domain events, Mermaid ERD
4. **Tech Stack Research** — Derive requirements from domain, WebSearch 3+ options per layer, comparison matrix
5. **Project Structure + Test Strategy** — Folder layout, CI/CD, PBI backlog, final plan review

**Key Rules:**

- **AI surface?** Only if the system adds or changes a model call, agent, tool/MCP, retrieval or eval (see `node .claude/scripts/ai-signal-scan.cjs`): read `.claude/skills/shared/protocols/ai-feature-framing-gate.md` and apply it in the stack and architecture stages; otherwise skip this line.
- NEVER ask about tech stack upfront — derive from business analysis (Stages 1-6 first)
- Every stage MUST end with `AskUserQuestion` before proceeding
- Save artifacts at EVERY step — never keep findings only in memory
- All tech recommendations require confidence % and evidence (sources, benchmarks)
- Present 2-4 options for every major decision

> **[IMPORTANT]** NEVER skip user validation at decision points. NEVER recommend tech without comparison of alternatives. Every stage MUST end with `AskUserQuestion`.
> **Evidence Gate:** MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION — every claim, finding, and recommendation requires `file:line` proof or traced evidence with confidence percentage (>80% to act, <80% must verify first).
> **External Memory:** For complex or lengthy work (research, analysis, scan, review), write intermediate findings and final results to a report file in `tmp/reports/` — prevents context loss and serves as deliverable.

## When to Use

- No existing codebase detected (greenfield project)
- User wants to start new project from scratch
- Planning new application architecture, tech stack, domain model
- `/workflow-greenfield-init` workflow or greenfield mode detected by planning skills

## Capabilities

1. **Discovery Interview** — Problem statement, vision, constraints, team profile, scale expectations
2. **Market & Competitor Research** — WebSearch + WebFetch tech landscape, competitor analysis
3. **Tech Stack Evaluation** — Comparison matrix: pros/cons, confidence %, recommendation
4. **DDD Domain Modeling** — Bounded contexts, aggregates, entities, value objects, domain events
5. **Project Structure Generation** — Folder layout, module boundaries, CI/CD skeleton
6. **CLAUDE.md Generation** — Starter project instructions: tech stack, conventions, key paths
7. **Test Strategy** — Test pyramid, framework recommendations, spec outline

## Workflow (Full Waterfall)

Every stage MUST ATTENTION end with `AskUserQuestion` to validate decisions before proceeding.

## Key Rules

- **No guessing** — investigate first; NEVER fabricate file paths, function names, behavior. Unsure → say so. — why: fabricated foundation propagates into every downstream stage.
- **Full Waterfall** — EVERY stage MUST end with `AskUserQuestion` validation before advancing.
- **Save Artifacts** — write output to plan directory at EVERY step; NEVER keep findings only in memory. — why: context cutoff silently drops in-memory findings.
- **Evidence-Based** — every tech recommendation states confidence % plus evidence (web sources, benchmarks); NEVER recommend without proof.
- **Multiple Options** — present 2-4 options for every major decision (tech stack, architecture, hosting).
- **No Edit Tool** — NEVER use Edit tool; only create new plan artifacts. — why: safety guardrail protecting existing files.
- **Collaborate Hard** — ask probing questions, challenge assumptions, act as strategic advisor.
- **YAGNI/KISS/DRY** — recommend simplest viable architecture; flag over-engineering risks.

## Business-First Protocol (CRITICAL)

**NEVER ask about tech stack upfront.** Correct flow:

1. **Stages 1-6 (Business Analysis):** Focus exclusively on business problem, users, domain, constraints, scale expectations. Capture team skills/preferences as input signals only — NEVER as tech stack decisions.
2. **Stage 7 (Tech Stack Research):** Only after business analysis completes, use web research to:
    - Analyze business requirements → derive technical requirements (real-time needs, data volume, integration complexity, compliance)
    - WebSearch current framework/language comparisons, benchmarks, community health, enterprise adoption rates
    - Evaluate 3-4 tech stack options against derived requirements
    - Score each: team fit, scalability fit, ecosystem maturity, hiring market, cost, time-to-market
    - Produce detailed comparison report with pros/cons matrix
    - Present report with clear recommendation + confidence % — user decides as solution architect
3. **If user volunteers tech stack preference early:** Acknowledge, note as constraint/preference signal, but still perform full tech stack research to validate the choice or present better alternatives.

### Tech Stack Research Methodology

When executing Stage 7, follow this research protocol:

1. **Derive technical requirements** from business analysis artifacts:
    - Expected user scale → concurrent connections, database load
    - Domain complexity → type safety needs, ORM requirements
    - Integration needs → API ecosystem, third-party SDK availability
    - Compliance → security frameworks, audit trail capabilities
    - Team skills → learning curve, hiring availability
2. **WebSearch queries** (minimum 5):
    - "{requirement} best framework {current_year}"
    - "{option_A} vs {option_B} enterprise comparison"
    - "{option} production case studies {domain}"
    - "{option} community size github stars npm downloads"
    - "{option} security vulnerabilities track record"
3. **Comparison matrix** must include:

    | Criteria         | Option A | Option B | Option C | Weight |
    | ---------------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | ------ |
    | Team Fit         | ...      | ...      | ...      | High   |
    | Scalability      | ...      | ...      | ...      | High   |
    | Ecosystem/Libs   | ...      | ...      | ...      | Med    |
    | Hiring Market    | ...      | ...      | ...      | Med    |
    | Time-to-Market   | ...      | ...      | ...      | High   |
    | Cost (hosting)   | ...      | ...      | ...      | Med    |
    | Community Health | ...      | ...      | ...      | Low    |
    | Learning Curve   | ...      | ...      | ...      | Med    |

4. **Output:** `{plan-dir}/phase-02-tech-stack.md` with full comparison, sources cited, and final recommendation with confidence %

## Tech Stack Evaluation Format

For each tech decision, present:

```markdown
### {Decision Area} (e.g., Backend Framework)

| Option   | Pros | Cons | Team Fit       | Confidence |
| -------- | ---- | ---- | -------------- | ---------- |
| Option A | ...  | ...  | Good/Fair/Poor | 85%        |
| Option B | ...  | ...  | Good/Fair/Poor | 70%        |

**Recommendation:** Option A
**Why:** {1-2 sentence rationale linking to team skills, scale, and constraints}
```

## Domain Model Format

```markdown
### Bounded Context: {Name}

**Purpose:** {what this context owns}
**Aggregates:**

- {AggregateName} — {description}
    - Entities: {list}
    - Value Objects: {list}
    - Domain Events: {list}

**Context Map:** {relationships to other bounded contexts}
```

## Project Structure Best Practices

When recommending project structure, consider:

- **Monorepo vs Polyrepo** — team size, deployment independence, shared code needs
- **Folder Conventions** — feature-based vs layer-based, test colocation
- **CI/CD Skeleton** — pipeline stages, environments, deployment strategy
- **Dev Tooling** — linting, formatting, pre-commit hooks, editor config
- **Documentation** — README structure, ADR templates, API docs approach

## CLAUDE.md Generation

After tech stack confirmed, generate starter `CLAUDE.md` containing:

- Project name and description
- Tech stack summary (languages, frameworks, databases)
- Key file locations and directory structure
- Development commands (build, test, run)
- Naming conventions
- Architecture decision summary

## Output

- ALWAYS save all artifacts to plan directory — NEVER ephemeral
- Master `plan.md` with YAML frontmatter (title, description, status, priority, effort, branch, tags, created)
- Concise reports (<=150 lines per artifact)
- List unresolved questions at end of each artifact
- After all stages complete, announce completion, recommend next step (`/feature-implement` or `/bootstrap`)

<!-- SYNC:agent-code-standards -->

> **Development rules.** YAGNI / KISS / DRY. Place behavior with the owner established by the project's architecture and evidence; do not assume a fixed layer order or mapping/constant location. Follow local file naming and layout conventions. Search relevant existing patterns before changing code, and check their fit before reusing them. Read `.claude/docs/development-rules.md` for shared coding standards and quality gates (when present).
>
> **Coding patterns.** Before implementing, read the project pattern references named in `docs/project-config.json` / the docs index (e.g. `docs/project-reference/backend-patterns-reference.md`, `frontend-patterns-reference.md`) — local conventions override generic framework defaults.
>
> **Blocked until:** dev-rules + pattern docs read before writing or changing code.

<!-- /SYNC:agent-code-standards -->

<!-- SYNC:agent-bootstrap -->

> **Plan first, then act.** Break work into small tasks before editing; keep exactly one task in progress; mark each complete immediately after its evidence lands. On context loss, inspect the existing task list before creating new tasks.
>
> **Context guard / progress file (MANDATORY when task > 5 files or > 3 steps).** Context exhaustion = silent loss of ALL findings; no progress file = no recovery.
>
> 1. **On start:** create `tmp/ck-agent-{ts}-{rnd}.progress.md` — `ts` = current timestamp in `YYYYMMDDHHmmssSSS` (17 digits), `rnd` = random 6-char hex. First line records the session id.
> 2. **After each step:** append findings, marking `[done]` / `[partial]` / `[pending]`.
> 3. **Running out of context?** Write `[partial]` to the file FIRST — NEVER summarize before writing.
> 4. **Producing a report?** Create the `tmp/reports/` file path BEFORE the first finding, append findings incrementally, synthesize from the file, and start the final message with `Full report: <path>`.
>
> **Blocked until:** task breakdown exists · progress file created when the task exceeds the size threshold.

<!-- /SYNC:agent-bootstrap -->

<!-- SYNC:understand-code-first -->

> **Understand Existing Code First** — For code changes, read and trace the target before planning or editing; do not apply a code workflow to work with no code surface.
>
> 1. Search for relevant existing implementations and cite `file:line`; aim for 3+ comparable examples when they exist, and record when the project has fewer or none.
> 2. Read the target area and its configured project references; identify actual structure, owners, and conventions without assuming a framework, layer model, or base class.
> 3. Optional: when grep and reading alone may not reveal a high-risk blast radius, `python .claude/scripts/code_graph trace <file> --direction both --json` (when `.code-graph/graph.db` exists) can add callers and dependents — a hint that may be stale, verified by reading the files.
> 4. Map affected dependencies and callers with available repository tools (grep, reading); an absent, stale or unsupported graph never blocks or fails the task.
> 5. Write investigation to `tmp/analysis/` for non-trivial tasks (3+ files).
> 6. Re-read the analysis before implementing; update it when evidence changes.
> 7. Follow a fitting local pattern, or state why no suitable pattern exists and justify a project-appropriate choice.
>
> **BLOCKED until:** target and relevant existing patterns are inspected, applicable dependencies are traced, and material assumptions have evidence. If an item does not apply or the repository has no comparable implementation, record that fact rather than fabricating a gate result.

<!-- /SYNC:understand-code-first -->

<!-- SYNC:evidence-based-reasoning -->

> **Evidence-Based Reasoning** — Do not present inference as fact; ground material claims in evidence appropriate to the task.
>
> 1. Cite `file:line` for repository claims, configuration or reference paths for project rules, and URLs or artifact locations for external or observed claims.
> 2. State confidence when a conclusion is uncertain; verify material assumptions before acting and withhold recommendations when evidence is insufficient.
> 3. Trace the consumers, boundaries, or dependencies that exist in the affected path; do not assume services, modules, or architectural styles that the project does not use.
> 4. "I don't have enough evidence" is valid and expected output.
>
> **BLOCKED until:** material claims have traceable evidence, relevant searches are complete, and uncertainties are stated. Search comparable patterns when the task has existing implementations; record when none are available.
>
> **Forbidden without proof:** "obviously", "I think", "should be", "probably", "this is because"
> **If incomplete →** output: `"Insufficient evidence. Verified: [...]. Not verified: [...]."`

<!-- SYNC:fix-layer-accountability -->

> **Fix-Layer Accountability** — Do not assume the crash site owns the defect. Trace the actual execution and data flow, then fix the component that owns the violated contract.
>
> AI default behavior: see error at Place A → fix Place A without tracing. This can treat a symptom while leaving its cause in place.
>
> **MANDATORY before ANY fix:**
>
> 1. **Trace the affected path** — Map the real origin, transformations, boundaries, and observed failure in the surfaces this project uses. Do not invent absent layers.
> 2. **Identify the contract owner** — Use project architecture and code evidence to find which component is responsible for the invalid state or behavior.
> 3. **Choose the correction point** — Fix the authoritative owner and retain validation required at untrusted boundaries. A multi-file correction can be valid; justify it by the contracts each file owns rather than a file-count threshold.
> 4. **Check bypass paths** — Inspect relevant constructors, adapters, parsers, caches, persistence, or other entry points that actually exist in the affected flow.
>
> **BLOCKED until:** `- [ ]` The affected path is traced `- [ ]` Contract owner supported by `file:line` evidence `- [ ]` Relevant consumers and bypass paths checked `- [ ]` Correction point fits the project's architecture
>
> **Anti-patterns (REJECT these):**
>
> - "Fix it where it crashes" without tracing — the observed failure site may not own the violated contract.
> - "Add defensive checks at every consumer" without evidence — scattered workarounds can hide an uncorrected source defect.
> - "Always fix at the lowest layer" — a lower layer may not own the contract; prove ownership from this project's architecture.

<!-- SYNC:design-patterns-quality -->

> **Design Quality** — Be opinionated about changeability, and choose techniques by their preconditions. For brownfield work, project config, references, accepted decisions, and current code define the local architecture; do not silently replace a settled pattern. For a new non-trivial system, treat the options below as hypotheses; use the domain, change, and deployment boundaries to select a fit, not a universal target architecture.
>
> 1. **DRY the knowledge, not merely the text.** Keep one owner for a business rule or policy that must change together. Similar-looking code with different reasons to change may stay separate; extract shared functions, modules, types, or components when a real consumer and lower change cost justify them.
> 2. **Give modules explicit responsibilities and dependency direction.** A modular monolith can fit a new application with one release boundary and no evidenced need for independent deployment, scaling, compliance, availability, or runtime; choose another topology when measured ownership or operating boundaries require it. Use Clean/Hexagonal/Ports-and-Adapters ideas to keep policy independent of volatile infrastructure when that boundary buys testability or change isolation. Add layers only when each owns a real contract; split deployment/services only for a demonstrated scaling, ownership, availability, compliance, or release need.
> 3. **Model the domain to its actual complexity.** Use DDD language, aggregates, value objects, and explicit invariants where domain rules and lifecycle matter. Keep straightforward CRUD workflows simple; do not add tactical DDD ceremony without domain complexity.
> 4. **Use events for real decoupling.** Domain/integration events and messaging fit asynchronous reactions or independently owned modules/services. Define idempotency, ordering, retry/recovery, and an outbox/CDC strategy when delivery crosses a durable boundary. Use a direct call inside one consistency boundary when asynchronous delivery adds no value.
> 5. **Use Repository and Unit of Work at meaningful persistence boundaries.** They fit when they protect aggregate/query contracts, isolate a changing persistence technology, or coordinate a real transaction. Do not wrap every ORM call in a generic repository or add a Unit of Work that duplicates the platform's transaction behavior.
> 6. **Apply OOP/SOLID where the language and model use objects.** Prefer cohesive responsibilities, dependency inversion at volatile boundaries, and composition before inheritance; avoid interface-per-class and abstractions with no second implementation or test seam. In functional or data-oriented code, preserve the same cohesion, explicit dependencies, and small contracts without forcing classes.
> 7. **Build UI from cohesive components.** Keep state at the narrowest useful owner; use a store for state genuinely shared across components/routes or for coordinated async data. Add caching only with a freshness/invalidation policy and evidence of a repeated or expensive read. Use the framework's reactive model for composable asynchronous changes and dispose subscriptions/resources by its lifecycle. Apply BEM when the project uses SCSS/BEM; otherwise follow the selected CSS modules, utility, or naming method.
> 8. **Place behavior with its invariant/data owner.** Trace callers and dependencies; use the owner selected by the project's architecture. Do not assume Entity > Service > Controller, or any other fixed layer order.
> 9. **After extraction/move/rename:** grep the full affected scope for dangling references. Preserve project naming/style and verify caller contracts before changing an abstraction.
>
> **Selection gate:** read project config, references, accepted decisions, and comparable implementations. Name the problem/precondition a chosen pattern solves, the simpler alternative, and the trade-off. Configuration may select a stack-specific pattern; it does not make an unjustified abstraction free.
>
> **Review dimensions:** use focused passes over applicable concerns, then group repeated, evidenced violations when they share one cause. A repeated smell is not automatically a defect; name the damaged quality attribute and project-specific consequence.

<!-- SYNC:scaffold-production-readiness -->

> **Scaffold Readiness** — Evaluate these foundation areas against the requested artifact, project config, and deployment model. Include applicable foundations; mark non-applicable areas N/A with a reason instead of adding unrelated stack requirements:
>
> 1. **Quality tooling** — use or propose tooling appropriate to the language, repository, and delivery process; document selected tools in project references/config when available.
> 2. **Error handling** — define behavior at applicable process, API, CLI, library, or user-interface boundaries; use HTTP status handling or user notifications only when those surfaces exist.
> 3. **Asynchronous interaction** — provide progress/loading and cancellation behavior when the artifact exposes long-running work to a user or caller; do not add a universal loading tracker to non-interactive projects.
> 4. **Runtime and deployment** — use the declared hosting and deployment model. Container files and multiple run modes are required only when selected by the project; prove each supported mode with its actual command.
> 5. **External integrations** — document and test applicable outbound boundaries; choose timeout, retry, idempotency, or circuit-breaking behavior to fit the protocol and failure modes.
>
> **Gate:** resolve every applicable foundation before implementation. Ask for a decision only when an unresolved choice materially changes the architecture or user-visible behavior.

<!-- SYNC:module-detection -->

> **Module Detection** — Detect target module from PBI/idea keywords. Match against the directory names under the business spec root (default `docs/specs`; a `specRoots.business.path` entry in `docs/project-config.json` overrides the path) and load `<that root>/{module}/` for domain rules. If ambiguous, ask user. The module list is DERIVED by listing that root at run time — hardcode neither a module name nor the root itself.

The top-down companion to `SYNC:scale-technique-gate`: instead of *"is technique X present?"*, put the system UNDER concrete failure/load scenarios and judge whether it SURVIVES, SELF-HEALS, and whether its BUSINESS needs it to. **ADVICE-ONLY: emit the Scenario Stress Matrix as guidance; NEVER mutate any score, verdict band, or gate pass/fail.**
>
> 1. **Reuse the scale tier** derived by `SYNC:scale-technique-gate` (or derive it identically from evidence); **also derive business-criticality `B0`–`B3`** from specs/SLA/product docs + the domain, cite `file:line` + confidence. `B0` best-effort · `B1` important · `B2` business-critical · `B3` mission-critical/regulated. Unknown → state the assumption, do **NOT** default to `B3`/`T3`. **Criticality-signal floor (both-directions safety):** regulated / PII / financial / health data, money movement, auth/identity, or legal-compliance scope raises `B` to **at least `B2` even absent SLA/SLO docs**; anti-over-engineering lowers hardening ONLY when NO such signal is present. `B` (blast if it fails) and `T` (scale of load/data) are independent — a low-traffic payroll run is low-`T`, high-`B`.
> 2. **Select in-scope scenarios** — only those the system's `B`/`T` combination warrants (a `B0` internal PoC skips region-loss/DR entirely; a `B3`/`T0` regulated service still needs backups + DR by BUSINESS, not scale).
> 3. **Walk each in-scope scenario:** simulate the stimulus → trace the break path → name the failure signature → answer the self-heal/recovery question (auto-recover? MTTR? manual runbook?) → name the trade-off it forces. Families: traffic spike · sustained growth · data-volume growth · write/ingest burst · dependency down/slow · instance/node loss · zone/region loss · **data loss/corruption** · poison-message/retry-storm · cascading failure/backpressure · cold-start/deploy-blip · clock-skew/duplicate-delivery.
> 4. **Assign one verdict per scenario:** `WITHSTANDS` · `DEGRADES-GRACEFULLY` · `FAILS-HARD` (→ **advise only**) · `N/A-by-business` (not warranted → skip, not a gap) · `OVER-HARDENED` (resilience beyond business need → **advise AGAINST**, cite carrying cost).
> 5. **Anti-over-engineering guard (first-class):** a lean system whose business does not need HA/DR is a PASS; `OVER-HARDENED` flags resilience the business does not warrant. This guard is symmetric with the criticality-signal floor above — never under-harden a `B2`+ system just because its traffic is low.

> **Test Architecture & Execution Contract** — Treat testability as a setup/architecture acceptance condition. Identify the test types and execution modes required by the project contract and task risk (for example unit, integration/system, E2E, performance/scale). Record `APPLICABLE` only with evidence of a relevant runner/framework/configuration; otherwise record `N/A — <evidence>` and never fabricate coverage or impose a universal tier threshold.
>
> 0. **Make the protected intent explicit in the project's test format.** Every assertion-bearing test states the behavior or technical invariant it protects and makes its inputs, trigger, and owned outcome understandable. Use `Given / When / Then` when the project's spec/config selects it or it fits; otherwise keep the project's native organization (property/fuzz tests describe the input space and property; harness and mutation tests use their native contract). Do not rewrite a test solely to adopt a framework-wide syntax.
>    Link the case to the configured owner/case/scenario identity and its `intent` or `contracts` role when `specArtifacts` is valid; when absent, record `Business Intent / Invariant Guarded` (or the technical contract). A malformed declared profile blocks without fallback. One behavior per case. The final assertion proves the outcome the test owns, not only an internal call, delivery bookkeeping, or setup side effect. Fixture/runner glue is exempt only when it holds no assertion. Convert legacy brownfield cases when touched; a broader migration is a named owned opportunity, and a safety-critical case without clear phases is `BLOCKED`.
>
> 1. **Matrix before implementation:** for each required test type record applicability, owner, runner/framework, test root, fixture/data strategy, full command, focused/partial command, zero-match behavior, CI gate, a simple entry point when useful, each supported execution mode, and the environments the project promises to support.
> 1a. **E2E profile handoff:** also record the selected `surfaceIds[]`, the linked `localRun` owner, auth mode/reference, seed/data mode, browser runner/engine/headed setting, action-delay policy, evidence root/capture/redaction policy, and convergence cap. Missing fields stay explicit blockers or N/A; never fill them from generic browser defaults.
> 2. **Runnable scopes:** full and focused commands are copy-ready, fail on invalid or zero-match selections, report exact counts and exit status, and are safe to repeat. E2E uses the configured browser/service commands and the project's synchronization strategy.
> 2a. **E2E organization gate (when E2E is applicable):** reuse the configured/discovered test organization — fixtures, shared helpers, scoped locator handles, page objects, or another evidenced structure — and record its actual owners. A Page Object Model is one valid pattern, never a universal requirement.
> 2b. **E2E reuse and DRY gate:** keep shared lifecycle, locator, readiness, auth, data, and evidence behavior at the project's existing reusable owner and final outcome assertions in the test. Reuse or compose existing helpers before creating new ones, keep one canonical owner per selector/action/wait, and treat duplicated wrappers or setup as a review signal; extract when a shared owner reduces change cost without crossing project boundaries.
> 2c. **E2E test layering:** test reusable behavior at its actual owner where the harness supports it; feature tests cover user outcomes and local composition. Do not invent component tiers or lower-tier contract tests the project does not use.
> 2d. **E2E synchronization:** wait for observable readiness and outcome conditions with bounded runner-native waits or the configured helper, with useful timeout diagnostics; apply action delays only when the project contract specifies them, and never use fixed sleeps as readiness evidence.
> 3. **Fresh valid state (when mutable or shared state applies):** isolate each test/run through the project's supported setup and public paths. Use unique identities for shared mutable data, realistic valid data for the behavior under test, and idempotent/restart-safe setup when fixtures or seeders persist. Intentional accumulation is additive and integrity-checked; never hide contamination with destructive reset.
>    Run-scoped cleanup, when supported, is opt-in and idempotent: after evidence capture it removes only ephemeral resources owned by the current run — never persistent/additive data or another run's data, never a shared-state reset, never a substitute for no-reset proof.
> 4. **Isolation and fidelity:** isolate mutable/shared data and parallel workers; share only immutable/reference data. Use realistic input and observable arrange barriers where behavior depends on them. Do not widen retries or weaken assertions to make a scenario pass.
> 5. **Evidence gate:** report command, scope, identity/data mode, exact result, and repeat proof; for persistent-state suites, verify repeatability without destructive reset at the level the project gate requires. Line coverage is diagnostic only; use property/invariant, mutation, change, or behavior signals when the tooling supports them.
> 6. **Execution modes and environment reach:** exercise each mode and environment the project declares it supports (for example host/container or local/CI), parameterizing targets rather than maintaining needless forks; record unexercised declared capabilities as a gap. A production-shaped target applies only when the project requires it; tests that can reach production need an enforced safe scope and report `ENVIRONMENT-BLOCKED` when it is missing. Pin dependencies and declare external prerequisites where the reproducibility contract requires. Depth → `SYNC:engineering-foundation-gate` **F1/F2/F3**.
>
> **Ownership:** Architecture/harness defines the matrix; scaffold/workflow makes it runnable; test writers implement tier-specific cases; reviewers verify the contract; the runner reports; seed-data owners preserve uniqueness, idempotency, realism, and accumulation integrity.

>    - **F1 Reproducible environment** (ALL profiles — the floor) — Document clean-machine-to-running path; pin toolchains, lock dependencies, declare every external prerequisite and how to obtain/fake it; environment-inject config, never machine-implicit; deterministic build. → `scaffold` · `architecture --mode=scalability`
>    - **F2 Supported execution modes** (used/required modes only; no universal second mode) — document/exercise developer/test/deployment paths (host/container, local/managed, simulator/device), sharing config where possible. One mode fits → verify, comparison `N/A-by-profile`; invent no Docker/Compose/host path. Broken/irreproducible claimed or required modes are defects. → `scaffold` · `production-readiness-review`
>    - **F3 Environment-portable tests** (local+CI all profiles; production-shaped `T1+`/`B2+`) — the SAME suites run against local, CI and production-like targets, **parameterized by configuration, never by forked test code**. Missing capability → `ENVIRONMENT-BLOCKED`, never a silent pass; unsafe-in-production tests are excluded by an **enforced** mechanism. _"Runs in prod"_ means a safe, declared, **NON-MUTATING** subset. → `test-architecture-execution-contract` · `integration-test --mode=review`
>    - **F4 Test-strength proof** (wherever tests exist) — Prove tests **fail when code is wrong**, strongest first: (a) **automated fault injection** scoped to CHANGED code; (b) **deliberate defect-seeding drill — the universal fallback:** break the code behind a top invariant, run the suite, record **WHICH NAMED TEST went red**, restore — nothing red ⇒ write the killing test; (c) **assertion-intent audit:** flag assertions that survive an inverted implementation, check only non-nullness/type, re-assert the input, or assert infrastructure bookkeeping. **Line coverage is a DIAGNOSTIC, never a gate.** **Scope:** verify the PROJECT HAS a test-strength mechanism; PER-CHANGE enforcement belongs to `integration-test --mode=review` Gate 1's Mutation Probe Ledger. Report gaps once. → `harness-setup` · `integration-test --mode=review`
>    - **F5 Performance & scale-under-data** (`T1+`/`B2+` for a real tier; `T0`/`B0` = one documented largest-expected-volume check) — **MEASURE performance with a runnable check that CAN FAIL** and documented command; **realistic volume AND shape** (distribution, cardinality, skew); **named latency/throughput/memory budgets the run ASSERTS**; growth across **≥2 volumes ~10× apart**; resource exhaustion as a **tested, bounded** outcome (backpressure, paging or a clean error, not an OOM kill; no unbounded result-sets, accumulation or concurrency on the paths that matter). Label each number a regression signal or a capacity statement. → `performance-review` · `seed-test-data`
>    - **F6 Build & change scalability** (`R1+` declared style + boundaries; `R2+` computable affected set, enforced checks, measured incrementality) — build/test cost and blast radius **do NOT grow with the codebase**. Requires: a **COMPUTABLE** affected module set from declared inter-module dependencies; **measured** incrementality and caching; boundaries enforced **MECHANICALLY**; a **declared**, enforced architecture style; implementation behind abstraction so a technology swaps without touching business code; a fast scoped inner-loop check. **Scope:** cite existing `architecture --mode=scalability` **G2 Build & CI Scalability**/**G4** verdicts; do not re-score. → `architecture --mode=scalability` · `architecture --mode=review` (diff-level boundary drift) · `complexity-prevention`
>    - **F7 Mechanical quality harness** (format + lint + type/static analysis + build/test at ALL profiles; architecture-fitness `R1+`; dependency health + secret scanning wherever real data ships, unconditional at `B2+`; complexity/duplication + drift `R1+`/`T1+`) — **account for EVERY class or record it `N/A` with a reason:** formatting · lint/correctness · type & static analysis · complexity & duplication · **executable architecture-fitness** · dependency vulnerability & license · secret scanning · build/test gates plus the **F4** signal · documentation/config drift. Local and CI run the **SAME** command, configuration and version; checks **ENFORCE**, not warn; strictest reasonable defaults, loosened only with a recorded reason; cheap checks first. Brownfield adoption uses a **ratchet** — fail on NEW violations, tolerate the baseline — which counts as `PRESENT`. → `linter-setup` · `harness-setup` · `security-audit`
> 3. **One verdict per dimension:** `PRESENT` (proven by cited evidence) · `MISSING-WARRANTED` · `PARTIAL-WITH-PATH` (gap + concrete incremental step) · `N/A-by-profile` (below the warranting profile — **a correctly-lean project is a PASS, never a deficiency**) · `OVER-ENGINEERED` (present but unwarranted → advise AGAINST, name the carrying cost) · `UNVERIFIED` (could not be checked; **NEVER score an unverified dimension `PRESENT`**).
> 4. **Authority:** **CREATING** (greenfield init/scaffold/build-test-CI plan) → `MISSING-WARRANTED` is **BLOCKING**; warranted omissions need explicit decisions. **AUDITING** (brownfield/architecture/changes review) → **ADVISORY ONLY** matrix + prioritized adoption path; **NEVER mutate any score, `/20`, `/24`, verdict band, or gate PASS/FAIL**.
> 5. **Symmetric anti-over-engineering guard.** Do NOT demand a container mode of a single-author utility, a distributed load platform for a small internal service, affected-set computation for a single module, or overlapping analyzers for one defect class; module splits follow real module and team count, never aesthetics. Symmetrically, never UNDER-harden a `B2+` system merely because its traffic is low.
> 6. **Every brownfield finding names a smallest independently valuable next step.** Default ladder: pin the toolchain & commit the lockfile → one local command that CI also runs → ratchet the harness on (fail-on-new) → run the defect-seeding drill on the top invariants → repair the missing execution mode → seed a realistic volume and assert ONE budget → declare the style, then enforce dependency direction. Deviate on evidence and say why.
> 7. **Output — Foundation Readiness Matrix:** `dimension | warranted at this profile? | present? | verdict | evidence (file:line/config/CI) | smallest next step`, after the derived profile (per-axis evidence + confidence), before the adoption path (brownfield) or blocking list (greenfield). Full catalog → `.claude/docs/engineering-foundation-catalog.md`. **Drift-guard: profile axes, dimensions, verdicts and warranting tiers are AUTHORITATIVE in that catalog — update it FIRST, then re-run `.claude/scripts/inject_engineering_foundation_gate.py` to re-propagate. Scale tier stays single-sourced in `scale-technique-catalog.md`; business criticality in `scenario-stress-catalog.md`.**

> **AI Agent as a First-Class User / Machine-Interaction Contract** — Strong recommendation when creating a greenfield system; optional, evidence-gated advice for a big feature or architecture review. Treat an AI agent as a potential non-human actor with its own identity, authority, tenancy, safety policy, and observable outcomes — not as a trusted administrator or UI automation shortcut. This supplements, never replaces, the shared authorization, API, security, and test contracts.
>
> 1. **Classify the actor and relationship.** From product and threat-model evidence, identify agent personas (user-delegated copilot, tenant automation, platform operator, service agent, integration agent), the human or organization it may act for, tenant/resource scope, trust level, allowed autonomy, data/action budgets, and human approval points. An agent is not automatically the human, tenant administrator, or platform administrator.
> 2. **Make one application capability core.** Express business use cases in a stable application boundary reused by human UI and machine surfaces. API, CLI, MCP, WebMCP, webhook/event, SDK, or batch adapters may translate contracts, but must not duplicate domain rules or bypass validation/authentication/authorization. Name and version contracts by purpose, use machine-readable input/output schemas, stable error codes, idempotency for retries, pagination or asynchronous status where needed, timeouts/cancellation, correlation IDs, quotas/rate limits, and deprecation policy.
> 3. **Choose surfaces by evidence.** Use API/OpenAPI for remote machine integrations (`https://spec.openapis.org/oas/latest.html`); CLI for local/operator/automation; MCP for LLM-host discovery of tools, resources, and prompts; WebMCP for a browser-integrated agent when an applicable browser/runtime supports it; webhooks/events for push integration; SDK only when it lowers consumer cost. Evaluate relevant surface(s) and record `APPLY-NOW`, `ADAPT-IN-SLICE`, `DEFER-AS-OPPORTUNITY`, `NOT-APPLICABLE`, or `BLOCKED`; never build all surfaces without a user/job and owner.
> 4. **MCP contract.** When MCP is applicable, expose least-privilege, capability-oriented tools/resources/prompts over currently supported transports (stdio for local, Streamable HTTP for remote, or another explicitly justified adapter). Tool names and descriptions are concise and truthful; input/output schemas, structured results/errors, pagination, deterministic discovery, progress/cancellation, long-running task polling, idempotency, and audit/tool-call IDs are explicit. Use the official specification (`https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/`) and authorization guidance (`https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/basic/authorization`) as the current protocol references.
> 5. **WebMCP is progressive enhancement.** When a web surface and browser-agent support exist, expose narrow page capabilities through the current WebMCP draft API behind a project-owned adapter; never make the domain or primary API contract depend on a draft/browser-only feature. Register only safe, purpose-named tools, validate at server-side/application boundaries, and test direct tool execution against the UI path. Treat tool metadata, page content, and tool output as untrusted input; defend against prompt/output injection and confused-deputy behavior. The official WebMCP page currently labels the proposal a Draft Community Group Report, not a W3C Standard or Standards Track feature (`https://webmachinelearning.github.io/webmcp/`).
> 6. **Secure every agent path.** Give agents distinct authentication and authorization. Resolve delegated human, organization, service-account, or integration identity; enforce deny-by-default, least privilege, tenant/resource scope, action-specific permissions, expiry/revocation, rate/usage budgets, replay/idempotency protection, and separation of duties at the application boundary. No agent self-granting, client-supplied role/tenant claims, privilege escalation, or inbound-token passthrough to downstream services. High-impact, destructive, financial, or privacy-sensitive actions require explicit consent, preview/dry-run, or step-up policy unless an approved autonomous policy says otherwise.
> 7. **Make consent and audit inspectable.** Record who/what acted (agent identity, delegating principal, tenant, client/host, model/session/run where available), capability/tool/action, redacted inputs, policy/consent decision, result/error, correlation ID, and timestamp. Provide discoverable scopes, tool permissions, revoke/rotate paths, and human-visible confirmation for high-impact actions. Keep agent output/data boundaries and retention explicit.
> 8. **Operate it like a product surface.** Document onboarding/discovery, credentials, environment, schema/version compatibility, examples, rate/timeout/error behavior, partial-failure/retry semantics, long-running jobs, support/deprecation, and safe rollback. Monitor adoption, denied calls, latency, errors, retries, quota/cost, sensitive-data exposure signals, and anomalous behavior; provide runbooks and kill/revoke controls.
> 9. **Test the contract and equivalence.** Every agent-facing contract test names the business intent/technical contract and expresses its preconditions, action, and owned outcome in the project's native test format; Given/When/Then is one option. Verify allowed/denied/cross-tenant paths, schema compatibility, the same outcome as the human/API path, idempotent retries/replay, prompt/output injection, unsafe tool descriptions, authorization expiry/revocation, pagination, timeout/cancellation, rate limits, and audit records. Assert the outcome owned by the application, not only tool-call or transport bookkeeping.
> 10. **Apply lifecycle scope correctly.** Greenfield must produce an agent actor/access matrix, selected surfaces and rationale, capability contracts, threat/consent model, test/observability plan, and explicit owner before the first implementation plan; a warranted omission requires an explicit decision/acceptance. Big-feature and `architecture --mode=review` use this as optional advice: inspect existing setup and advise only when agent use is evidenced or a future contract is accepted; safely adapt in the slice, or create an owned `DEFER-AS-OPPORTUNITY` with owner, trigger, dependency order, smallest next step, and cost of delay. If safety/correctness requires the work, mark `BLOCKED`; never silently turn a feature into an agent-platform refactor.
>
> **Required output:** `agent/persona | relationship/delegation | identity/authn | tenant/resource scope | capabilities/actions | selected surface(s) | contract/version | consent/safety | observability/audit | status/owner/next step | acceptance/revisit trigger`.
>
> **BLOCKED until (when applicable/selected):** actor and authority are explicit · each exposed capability has an owner, schema, authz, safety policy, and observable outcome · the selected API/CLI/MCP/WebMCP adapter reuses the application capability core · allowed/denied/cross-tenant paths and high-impact controls are tested · version/discovery/rollback/telemetry are planned · greenfield omissions are explicitly accepted; otherwise record evidence-backed `NOT-APPLICABLE` or `DEFER-AS-OPPORTUNITY`.

> **Core Engineering Principles — Easy to Change · Easy to Scale · Easy to Maintain** — The success metric of every plan, implementation and review is _future change cost_: the next change must be cheap, safe and provable. DRY, reuse, abstraction, interfaces, wrappers, patterns, layering, tests and the harness exist only to serve that goal. Apply this gate BEFORE any narrower design rule or checklist; when a narrower design rule would raise change cost, this principle wins — it never waives a required gate (tests, review, security, user confirmation). It is evidence-gated: judge fit against the project's config, accepted decisions and local patterns, and never impose a technique the project does not use.
>
> 1. **Easy to change.** Keep one owner per piece of knowledge — DRY the rule, not look-alike text. Reuse an existing helper, component or module before writing a new one (search 3+ siblings and cite them). Put purpose-named interfaces or ports at volatile boundaries: wrap a third-party SDK or infrastructure dependency in an adapter when it is volatile, likely to be swapped, or needs a test seam, so a swap touches one place — a stable dependency used directly is fine, and a pass-through wrapper that lowers no change cost is a defect. Keep units small and cohesive with explicit dependencies; no hidden state, boolean traps or leaked implementation detail. Extract an abstraction for a real second consumer or an evidenced change axis, never for speculation; prefer the reversible decision and defer an irreversible one until evidence forces it. Depth → `SYNC:design-patterns-quality`, `SYNC:complexity-prevention`.
> 2. **Easy to scale.** Growth in features, modules, team, data or load must not multiply edit sites or cost. Add a variant by extension (a new handler, registration or config entry), not by editing every switch over the same discriminator. Keep module boundaries and dependency direction explicit. Bound every loop, query, result set, queue and concurrency on the paths that matter, so work grows with the request, not with total data. Scale only what the project's profile warrants — no speculative distribution or infrastructure. Depth → `SYNC:scale-technique-gate`, `SYNC:engineering-foundation-gate` (F5, F6).
> 3. **Easy to maintain.** Protect every changed behavior with tests that name the business intent or invariant and FAIL when it breaks — happy, error, edge, boundary and regression paths, not only the changed line. Tests are repeatable and isolated. The mechanical harness (format, lint, types, build, test — the same command locally and in CI) runs and passes. Names and structure state intent, and docs or specs that embed the behavior stay in sync. Depth → `SYNC:engineering-foundation-gate` (F3, F4, F7), `SYNC:harness-setup`.
>
> **By phase:**
>
> - **Plan** — each phase names what it reuses (`file:line`), the seam or abstraction it adds or why none is needed, the next plausible change and its edit-site count, the growth bound, and the test that proves each invariant — or `N/A` with a reason where an item cannot apply (a docs-only phase has no growth bound).
> - **Implement** — search for reuse before writing; after writing, recount the edit sites of the next plausible change, confirm each new test fails when its intent breaks, and run the harness.
> - **Review** — judge each pillar `PASS` / `FAIL` / `N/A` with `file:line` evidence and name the real enemy: coupling, duplicated knowledge, hidden state, unbounded growth, untested intent, unclear intent or an irreversible decision exposed too early. A finding names its consequence for the next change; absence of a pattern is not a defect.
>
> **Self-check before claiming done:** (1) What is the next plausible change, and how many files would it touch? (2) What breaks at 10× features, data or load? (3) Which named test goes red if this behavior breaks, and does the harness run it?

<!-- SYNC:test-architecture-execution-contract:reminder -->

**MUST ATTENTION** Each assertion-bearing test names the behavior or technical contract it protects and asserts an outcome it owns. Use the project's configured/native test format — Given/When/Then is one valid format, never a framework-wide requirement. When `specArtifacts` is valid, link configured owner/case/variant identity and `intent/contracts` evidence; when absent, name the guarded business intent or technical contract. A malformed declared profile BLOCKS without fallback. Broad test-format migration → assign an owner and next step, never rewrite cases outside scope.

**MUST ATTENTION** Before implementation record evidence-backed applicability for the test types and modes the task/project contract requires: copy-ready full and focused commands where available, zero-match behavior, a useful platform-appropriate entry point, supported execution modes and environments, state-isolation requirements, exact results, and repeat evidence where persistent state makes it relevant. Exercise claimed modes; report a missing required capability as `ENVIRONMENT-BLOCKED`. Never invent production targets or impose a test format. Browser/UI E2E uses the configured runner's waits or project helper for observable readiness and outcomes; apply action pacing only where the project contract specifies it. Reuse the project's evidenced test organization — require a POM, base class, or component taxonomy only when the project actually selects it.

## Closing Reminders

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION Goal:** Guide greenfield project inception from raw idea to an approved, implementable plan — tech stack, domain model, project structure, and starter configuration.

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION Protocols in force (concise digest of the SYNC/shared blocks this agent carries) — each line is a signpost to its canonical block above, NEVER a replacement; obey the full block:**

- **Code Standards:** YAGNI/KISS/DRY, lowest-layer logic, read patterns first.
- **Bootstrap:** plan into small tasks, progress file.
- **Agent Bootstrap:** plan tasks first, one in progress, persist findings to `tmp/reports/`.
- **Understand Code First:** read code, grep 3+, before writing.
- **Evidence:** cite `file:line`, confidence >80% to act.
- **Cross-Service Check:** scan producers/consumers/sagas/contracts before concluding.
- **Fix-Layer Accountability:** trace flow, fix at owning layer.
- **Sequential Thinking:** multi-step Thought N/M with confidence closer.
- **Design Patterns Quality:** DRY/SOLID, lowest layer, 3+ extract.
- **Scaffold Production Readiness:** 5 foundations before feature-implement.
- **Estimation Framework:** bottom-up hours, SP derived, risk margin.
- **Module Detection:** detect module from keywords, load specs context.

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** NEVER skip user validation — every stage MUST end with `AskUserQuestion` before proceeding — why: a waterfall stage built on an unvalidated decision corrupts every downstream stage.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** NEVER ask about tech stack upfront — derive it from business analysis (Stages 1-6 first); capture volunteered preferences as constraint signals only — why: tech chosen before the domain is understood fits the tool, not the problem.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** ALWAYS save artifacts to the plan directory at every stage; use create-only — NEVER the Edit tool — why: findings kept only in memory are lost on context cutoff, and Edit risks corrupting existing files.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** NEVER recommend tech without comparing 2-4 alternatives in a pros/cons matrix, each scored with confidence % plus evidence (web sources, benchmarks) — why: a single unbenchmarked recommendation is a guess wearing an architect's hat.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** cite `file:line` proof or traced evidence with confidence % for EVERY claim and finding — >80% to act, 60-80% verify first, <60% DO NOT recommend; "Insufficient evidence" is valid output — why: speculation presented as fact is the root of every hallucinated foundation.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** bootstrap a small task breakdown before any research/edit; keep exactly one task `in_progress`; on context loss inspect the existing task list before creating new tasks — why: untracked work silently duplicates or drops stages.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** search 3+ existing patterns and verify the new context shares the same preconditions (base classes, scope, constraints) before reusing one — why: the closest example rarely matches the actual constraints; blind copy propagates a mismatch.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** persist intermediate findings and final results incrementally to `tmp/reports/` for research/analysis work — why: long sub-agent runs hit budget before a final batch write, losing everything.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** keep domain concepts OUT of any generic/shared/infrastructure layer you scaffold — push them into the consumer via subclass/composition — why: a shared layer coupled to one consumer's domain is no longer reusable.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** recommend the simplest viable architecture (YAGNI/KISS/DRY) and flag over-engineering; behavior belongs with the component that owns its data or invariant, as established by project architecture and evidence — why: every speculative abstraction is debt with no proven demand.

**Anti-Rationalization:**

| "Team already knows React, skip the comparison" | Note it as a constraint signal, then still run full tech-stack research to validate or beat it. |

| "I'll keep these findings in context"           | Context cutoff drops them. Save to the plan directory at every step, no exceptions.             |
| "85% sure this framework wins"                  | Show the comparison matrix + sources. No `file:line`/benchmark = no recommendation.             |
| "Edit the existing file, it's faster"           | NEVER use Edit — create new plan artifacts only; Edit risks corrupting existing files.          |

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION Goal echo (recency):** raw idea → validated, evidence-backed, implementable greenfield plan — business analysis BEFORE tech, `AskUserQuestion` gate every stage, save every artifact, confidence % on every recommendation.
