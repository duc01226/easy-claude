## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Stage, commit, and (only on explicit request) push changes in 2-4 tool calls — producing secret-free, conventional-commit history whose every body OPENS with a derived `Estimate:` line, split into logical commits when types/scopes mix.

**Summary:** (read-this-if-nothing-else digest — purpose + ALL main steps + gates)

- **PURPOSE** — turn a working tree into secret-free conventional-commit history in 2-4 tool calls, splitting logically when types/scopes mix, and pushing ONLY on an explicit request.
- **STEP 1 — STAGE + SCAN (one compound command).** Stage all, count lines/files, scan for secrets, classify file groups — read its output ONCE.
- **GATE A (hard) — SECRETS > 0 → STOP and block.** Show the matched lines; NEVER commit through it.
- **STEP 2 — SPLIT DECISION.** Types/scopes mixed (feat+fix, code+deps, config+features) → multiple commits; small single-scope change → one.
- **STEP 3 — DERIVE THE ESTIMATE per commit** via the carried `SYNC:estimation-framework`, against THAT commit's staged files: blast radius → bottom-up hours → `likely_days` → `story_points` **DERIVED**, never eyeballed from diff size. Discount generated/lockfile/designer/i18n churn FIRST. Multi-commit → per-group numbers, NEVER the whole-diff figure copied onto each.
- **STEP 4 — GENERATE MESSAGE(S).** Simple: author directly. Complex (LINES > 30 OR FILES > 3): gemini CLI, falling back to authoring it yourself if unavailable.
- **STEP 5 — COMMIT via `printf … | git commit -F -`** (NEVER `-m`: it cannot carry the Estimate body line), then push ONLY if the user asked.
- **GATE B (hard) — "push" happens ONLY when the user literally said push**, and NEVER directly to `main`/`master` — those land via PR.
- **OUTPUT** — terse results only (<1k chars), no narration of what you did.

**Workflow:**

1. **Stage + Analyze** — one compound command: stage all, capture metrics (lines/files/secrets), classify file groups
2. **Split Decision** — single vs. multiple commits from type/scope mixing
3. **Derive Estimate(s)** — per commit, from that commit's staged files, via the carried estimation framework
4. **Generate Message(s)** — simple: craft directly; complex: gemini CLI
5. **Commit + Push** — execute commit(s) with `-F -`; push ONLY when the user explicitly requested it

**Key Rules:**

- SECRETS > 0 → STOP immediately, show matched lines, block commit — why: a leaked credential cannot be unpushed
- **Every commit body OPENS with `Estimate: <story_points> SP | man_days_ai: <x>d | man_days_traditional: <y>d`** — DERIVED per the carried framework, NEVER omitted, NEVER folded into the subject — why: both authorized commit paths carry the same requirement, so the metric lands whichever one ran
- Commit with `printf … | git commit -F -`, NEVER `-m` — why: a single-line `-m` cannot carry a body, so the mandatory Estimate line would silently vanish
- NEVER include AI attribution in commit messages — write `type(scope): description` only. The Estimate line is NOT attribution: it is a size metric, carrying no authorship claim
- NEVER push unless user explicitly said "push" / "commit and push" — "commit" alone means commit, not push
- Protected branches (main/master) → land via PR; NEVER direct push — why: bypasses required review

> **[IMPORTANT]** NEVER force push to main/master. NEVER commit secrets or .env files. NEVER skip pre-commit hooks.
> **Evidence Gate:** MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION — every claim, finding, and recommendation requires `file:line` proof or traced evidence with confidence percentage (>80% to act, <80% must verify first).
> **External Memory:** For complex or lengthy work (research, analysis, scan, review), write intermediate findings and final results to a report file in `plans/reports/` — prevents context loss and serves as deliverable.

## Workflow

### TOOL 1: Stage + Security + Metrics + Split Analysis (Single Command)

Execute this EXACT compound command:

```bash
git add -A && \
echo "=== STAGED FILES ===" && \
git diff --cached --stat && \
echo "=== METRICS ===" && \
git diff --cached --shortstat | awk '{ins=$4; del=$6; print "LINES:"(ins+del)}' && \
git diff --cached --name-only | awk 'END {print "FILES:"NR}' && \
echo "=== SECURITY ===" && \
git diff --cached | grep -c -iE "(api[_-]?key|token|password|secret|private[_-]?key|credential)" | awk '{print "SECRETS:"$1}' && \
echo "=== FILE GROUPS ===" && \
git diff --cached --name-only | awk -F'/' '{
  if ($0 ~ /\.(md|txt)$/) print "docs:"$0
  else if ($0 ~ /test|spec/) print "test:"$0
  else if ($0 ~ /\.claude\/(skills|agents|commands|workflows)/) print "config:"$0
  else if ($0 ~ /package\.json|yarn\.lock|pnpm-lock/) print "deps:"$0
  else if ($0 ~ /\.github|\.gitlab|ci\.yml/) print "ci:"$0
  else print "code:"$0
}'
```

**Read output ONCE. Extract:** LINES, FILES, SECRETS, FILE GROUPS.

**If SECRETS > 0:** STOP, show matched lines, block commit, EXIT — why: never let a credential reach history.

**Split Decision:**
MUST ATTENTION split into multiple commits if ANY:

1. Different types mixed (feat + fix, or feat + docs, or code + deps)
2. Multiple scopes in code files (frontend + backend, auth + payments)
3. Config/deps + code mixed together
4. FILES > 10 with unrelated changes

Keep single commit when: all files same type/scope, FILES <= 3, LINES <= 50, or all logically related.

### TOOL 2: Split Strategy (If needed)

**A) Single Commit:** Skip to TOOL 3.

**B) Multi Commit:**

```bash
gemini -y -p "Analyze these files and create logical commit groups: $(git diff --cached --name-status). Rules: 1) Group by type (feat/fix/docs/chore/deps/ci). 2) Group by scope if same type. 3) Never mix deps with code. 4) Never mix config with features. Output format: GROUP1: type(scope): description | file1,file2,file3 | GROUP2: ... Max 4 groups. <72 chars per message." --model gemini-2.5-flash
```

**If gemini unavailable:** Create groups yourself from FILE GROUPS:

- Group 1: All `config:` files -> `chore(config): ...`
- Group 2: All `deps:` files -> `chore(deps): ...`
- Group 3: All `test:` files -> `test: ...`
- Group 4: All `code:` files -> `feat|fix: ...`
- Group 5: All `docs:` files -> `docs: ...`

### TOOL 3: Generate Commit Message(s)

**A) Simple (LINES <= 30 AND FILES <= 3):** Create message yourself from Tool 1 output.

**B) Complex (LINES > 30 OR FILES > 3):**

```bash
gemini -y -p "Create conventional commit from this diff: $(git diff --cached | head -300). Format: type(scope): description. Types: feat|fix|docs|chore|refactor|perf|test|build|ci. <72 chars. Focus on WHAT changed. No AI attribution." --model gemini-2.5-flash
```

**C) Multi Commit:** Use messages from Tool 2 split groups.

### TOOL 4: Commit + Push

**A) Single Commit:**

```bash
printf '%s\n' \
  "TYPE(SCOPE): DESCRIPTION" \
  "" \
  "Estimate: <story_points> SP | man_days_ai: <x>d | man_days_traditional: <y>d" \
  "" \
  "- key change 1" \
  | git commit -F - && \
HASH=$(git rev-parse --short HEAD) && \
echo "commit: $HASH $(git log -1 --pretty=%s)" && \
if git push 2>&1; then echo "pushed: yes"; else echo "pushed: no (run 'git push' manually)"; fi
```

> **Why `-F -` and not `-m`:** the Estimate line is a **body** line (see `## Commit Message Standards`), and a single-line `-m "SUBJECT"` cannot carry a body at all — an agent following an `-m` template would produce a non-compliant commit with no signal anything was missing. `printf … | git commit -F -` carries the body without nesting a HEREDOC inside this `&&` chain (`/commit` Step 4 uses the HEREDOC form, which is equivalent but fragile mid-chain).

**B) Multi Commit (sequential):**
For each group:

```bash
git reset && \
git add file1 file2 file3 && \
printf '%s\n' \
  "TYPE(SCOPE): DESCRIPTION" \
  "" \
  "Estimate: <story_points> SP | man_days_ai: <x>d | man_days_traditional: <y>d" \
  "" \
  "- key change 1" \
  | git commit -F - && \
HASH=$(git rev-parse --short HEAD) && \
echo "commit $N: $HASH $(git log -1 --pretty=%s)"
```

> Per-group estimate: derive each group's `Estimate:` line from **that group's** staged files only — never copy the whole-diff figure onto every commit.

After all commits:

```bash
if git push 2>&1; then echo "pushed: yes (N commits)"; else echo "pushed: no (run 'git push' manually)"; fi
```

**Push ONLY if user explicitly requested** (keywords: "push", "and push", "commit and push") — absent those words, stop after committing.

## Pull Request Workflow

### PR TOOL 1: Sync and analyze remote state

```bash
git fetch origin && \
git push -u origin HEAD 2>/dev/null || true && \
BASE=${BASE_BRANCH:-main} && \
HEAD=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD) && \
echo "=== PR: $HEAD -> $BASE ===" && \
echo "=== COMMITS ===" && \
git log origin/$BASE...origin/$HEAD --oneline 2>/dev/null || echo "Branch not on remote yet" && \
echo "=== FILES ===" && \
git diff origin/$BASE...origin/$HEAD --stat 2>/dev/null || echo "No remote diff available"
```

### PR TOOL 2: Generate PR title and body

```bash
gemini -y -p "Create PR title and body from these commits: $(git log origin/$BASE...origin/$HEAD --oneline). Title: conventional commit format <72 chars. NO release/version numbers in title. Body: ## Summary with 2-3 bullet points, ## Test plan with checklist. No AI attribution." --model gemini-2.5-flash
```

**If gemini unavailable:** Create PR title and body from the commit list yourself.

### PR TOOL 3: Create PR

```bash
gh pr create --base $BASE --head $HEAD --title "TITLE" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Summary
- Bullet points here

## Test plan
- [ ] Test item
EOF
)"
```

### PR Analysis Rules

**DO use (remote comparison):**

- `git diff origin/main...origin/feature`
- `git log origin/main...origin/feature`

**DO NOT use (local comparison):**

- `git diff main...HEAD` (includes unpushed)
- `git diff --cached` (staged local)
- `git status` (local working tree)

### PR Error Handling

| Error                | Action                                                    |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Branch not on remote | `git push -u origin HEAD`, retry                          |
| Empty diff           | Warn: "No changes to create PR for"                       |
| Diverged branches    | `git pull --rebase origin $HEAD`, resolve conflicts, push |
| Network failure      | Retry once, then report connectivity issue                |
| Protected branch     | Warn: PR required (cannot push directly)                  |
| No upstream set      | `git push -u origin HEAD`                                 |

## Commit Message Standards

**Format:** `type(scope): description`

**Types:** feat | fix | docs | style | refactor | test | chore | perf | build | ci

**Rules:**

- <72 characters
- Present tense, imperative mood ("add feature" not "added feature")
- No period at end
- Scope optional but recommended
- Describe WHAT changed, not HOW

**Estimate line (MANDATORY — the FIRST line of the body):**

```
Estimate: <story_points> SP | man_days_ai: <x>d | man_days_traditional: <y>d
```

- Placed immediately after the blank line that follows the subject; NEVER folded into the subject, NEVER omitted. Both paths authorized to commit in this project (`/commit` and this agent) carry the same requirement, so the metric lands on every authored commit no matter which path ran.
- Derive it with the **`SYNC:estimation-framework`** block this agent carries (below), applied to the OBSERVED staged diff: blast-radius pass → bottom-up hours → `likely_days = ceil(bottom_up_hours / 6) × productivity_factor` → `story_points` **DERIVED** from `likely_days` (never eyeballed from diff size) → `man_days_ai` / `man_days_traditional` read off the SP→Days ladder.
- If a plan/PBI/story frontmatter already carries approved estimates for exactly this scope, REUSE them and append ` (source: <path>)`. Derive a partial slice bottom-up rather than copying the whole artifact’s number onto it.
- Discount non-implementation churn BEFORE estimating — generated code, lockfiles, ORM/designer snapshots, i18n re-sorting, bulk reformatting, and pure docs churn earn no story points.
- `0 SP` is the ONE value outside the Fibonacci set `1 | 2 | 3 | 5 | 8 | 13 | 21`, reserved for a pure merge/integration commit with no authored content.
- **Never block on it.** It is derived from the staged diff already on disk, so it never asks the user and never gates the commit.

**NEVER include AI attribution** — no "Generated with Claude", no "Co-Authored-By", no AI references. The Estimate line is **not** AI attribution: it is a size/effort metric about the change and carries no authorship claim, so this rule and the Estimate line stand together.

**Good:** `feat(auth): add user login validation`
**Bad:** `Updated some files` / `Fix bug`

## Output

**Single Commit:**

```
staged: 3 files (+45/-12 lines)
security: passed
commit: a3f8d92 feat(auth): add token refresh
pushed: yes
```

**Multi Commit:**

```
staged: 12 files (+234/-89 lines)
security: passed
split: 3 logical commits
commit 1: b4e9f21 chore(deps): update dependencies
commit 2: f7a3c56 feat(auth): add login validation
commit 3: d2b8e47 docs: update API documentation
pushed: yes (3 commits)
```

Keep output concise (<1k chars). State results only — no explanation of what you did.

## Error Handling

| Error              | Action                                   |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| Secrets detected   | Block commit, show matched lines         |
| No changes staged  | Exit cleanly                             |
| Nothing to add     | Exit cleanly                             |
| Merge conflicts    | Suggest `git status` + manual resolution |
| Push rejected      | Suggest `git pull --rebase`              |
| Gemini unavailable | Silent fallback, create message yourself |

> 2. **Read `docs/project-config.json` first — the project's machine-readable map.** It is the single source of truth for THIS repo (modules/paths, framework + search keywords, test/E2E/integration run-commands, design system, architecture rules, workflow patterns); ground exact paths, run-commands, and conventions on it **before investigating, planning, or coding** — never assume framework defaults (`CLAUDE.md` + reference docs are derived from it). If it — or the docs index, `lessons.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, or any required reference doc — is missing or stale, auto-run `/project-init` or the narrow route (`/project-config`, `/docs-init`, `/scan-all`, `/scan --target=<key>`, `/claude-md-init`) first; if Codex mirrors or `AGENTS.md` are stale, ask the user to run `/sync-codex` (never auto-run it).
> 3. Required docs by trigger: always `docs/project-reference/lessons.md`; doc lookup `docs-index-reference.md`; review `code-review-rules.md`; backend/CQRS/API `backend-patterns-reference.md`; domain/entity `domain-entities-reference.md`; frontend/UI `frontend-patterns-reference.md`; styles/design `scss-styling-guide.md` + `design-system/design-system-canonical.md`; integration tests `integration-test-reference.md`; E2E `e2e-test-reference.md`; feature docs/specs `feature-spec-reference.md` + `spec-system-reference.md` + `spec-principles.md`; behavior/public-contract/spec-test-code sync `workflow-spec-test-code-cycle-reference.md`; derived spec index/ERD/reimplementation guides `spec-system-reference.md` + source Feature Specs under `docs/specs/`; architecture/new area `project-structure-reference.md`.

<!-- SYNC:ai-mistake-prevention -->

> **AI Mistake Prevention** — Failure modes to avoid on every task:
>
> **Re-read files after context changes.** Context compaction, resume, or long-running work can make memory stale; verify current files before acting.
> **Verify generated content against source evidence.** AI hallucinates APIs, names, claims, and document facts. Check the relevant source before documenting or referencing.
> **Check downstream references before deleting or renaming.** Removing an artifact can stale docs, generated mirrors, configs, and callers; map references first.
> **Trace the full impact chain after edits.** Changing a definition can miss derived outputs and consumers. Follow the affected chain before declaring done.
> **Verify ALL affected outputs, not just the first.** One green check is not all green checks; validate every output surface the change can affect.
> **Assume existing values are intentional — ask WHY before changing OR flagging one as a defect.** Before changing or reporting a constant, limit, flag, cutoff, wording, or pattern, read nearby context and history, the CALLER's ordering, and 2+ sibling call sites of the same convention. A doc stating WHAT without WHY is missing rationale, not proof of a missing guard.
> **Surface ambiguity before acting — don't pick silently.** Multiple valid interpretations require an explicit question or stated assumption with risk.
> **Assert the outcome your system owns, not the intermediate state your infrastructure owns.** When verifying async work, assert the final business state — never the delivery/retry bookkeeping held in shared infrastructure that any co-running process can write. Such a check passes when run alone and flakes the moment anything else shares that infrastructure.

## Closing Reminders

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION Goal:** Stage, commit, and (only on explicit request) push changes in 2-4 tool calls — producing secret-free, conventional-commit history with logical multi-commit splitting when types/scopes mix.

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION — Protocols in force (concise digest of the SYNC/shared blocks this agent carries):**

- **Agent Bootstrap:** Plan tasks first, one in-progress, progress file when large.
- **Sequential Thinking:** Multi-step Thought N/M with revision/branch/hypothesis, confidence closer.
- **Task Tracking & External Report:** Bootstrap tasks, persist findings to `plans/reports/` incrementally.
- **Project Reference Docs Guide:** Read required project docs first; cite them before work.
- **Critical Thinking:** Traced `file:line` proof per claim, confidence >80% to act.
- **AI Mistake Prevention:** verify generated content against evidence, trace downstream references, verify all affected outputs, re-read after context loss, surface ambiguity.

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** NEVER commit secrets, .env files, or credentials — SECRETS > 0 = STOP immediately, show matched lines, block commit, EXIT — why: a pushed credential cannot be revoked by deletion alone
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** NEVER push unless user explicitly said "push" / "commit and push" — "commit" alone means commit not push; absent push keywords, stop after committing — why: pushing publishes unreviewed work, the highest-blast-radius irreversible agent action
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** NEVER force push to main/master — land protected-branch changes via PR — why: direct push bypasses required review and rewrites shared history

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** NEVER skip pre-commit hooks (`--no-verify`) — fix the underlying issue instead — why: hooks gate quality and security
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** NEVER `git commit --amend` — create a NEW commit instead — why: amending rewrites history and corrupts commits once HEAD moved
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** NEVER include AI attribution in commit messages — write `type(scope): description` only, no "Generated with Claude" / "Co-Authored-By"
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** Run the SINGLE compound stage-and-scan command first (TOOL 1) — read its LINES/FILES/SECRETS/FILE-GROUPS output ONCE — why: one read does staging, metrics, secret scan, and group classification in 2-4 tool calls
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** Split into multiple commits when types/scopes mix (feat+fix, code+deps, config+features, FILES>10 unrelated); keep ONE commit for same-type/scope, FILES<=3, LINES<=50 — why: mixed commits hide intent and block clean revert
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** Use the gemini CLI for complex commit/PR messages; if unavailable, author them yourself from FILE GROUPS — never block on a missing tool — why: the message must ship regardless of CLI availability
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** PR analysis uses REMOTE comparison (`origin/$BASE...origin/$HEAD`) — NEVER local (`main...HEAD`, `--cached`, `git status`) — why: local diffs include unpushed/staged noise that misrepresents the PR
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** Bootstrap a small task breakdown before multi-commit/PR work; transition one task at a time — on context loss inspect the existing task list first — why: prevents duplicate work and lost progress after compaction
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** Re-read any file before editing after context compaction; grep matched secret lines against actual diff — verify, do not assume — why: confirming a value exists is not confirming it is safe to commit
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** cite `file:line` / command output as evidence for every claim (confidence >80% to act, <80% verify first) — NEVER present a guess as fact — why: certainty without evidence is the root of every hallucinated commit
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** Output terse results only (<1k chars) — state what shipped, never explain what you did

**Anti-Rationalization:**

| -------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "User said commit, surely they want it pushed"     | "commit" ≠ "push". Stop after committing unless push keywords are present.                   |
| "Just one secret match, probably a false positive" | SECRETS > 0 blocks. Show the matched lines and STOP — never auto-judge a credential safe.    |
| "On main, I'll just commit directly here"          | Branch first. Protected-branch changes land via PR, never direct push.                       |
| "Small change, skip the split analysis"            | Run TOOL 1 anyway — mixed types/scopes hide in small diffs too.                              |
| "gemini is down, I'll skip the message"            | Author the conventional-commit message yourself from FILE GROUPS — the message always ships. |
| "Pre-commit hook is slow, I'll `--no-verify`"      | NEVER bypass hooks. Fix the underlying issue — hooks gate quality and security.              |

**[TASK-PLANNING]** Before multi-commit or PR work, analyze scope and break it into small TaskCreate todos with a final review task.

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION Goal:** Stage, commit, and (only on explicit request) push secret-free, conventional-commit history whose every body OPENS with a derived `Estimate:` line — split commits when types/scopes mix.

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION main steps — execute in order, the agent AI keeps forgetting:** (1) STAGE + SCAN with the SINGLE compound command, read its output once; (GATE A) SECRETS > 0 → STOP and block; (2) SPLIT DECISION from type/scope mixing; (3) DERIVE the `Estimate:` line per commit from THAT commit's staged files via the carried `SYNC:estimation-framework` — SP DERIVED from `likely_days`, churn discounted first, per-group numbers on a multi-commit run; (4) GENERATE the message (gemini for complex, self-authored fallback); (5) COMMIT with `printf … | git commit -F -`; (GATE B) push ONLY on an explicit push request, and never directly to a protected branch. — why: `-m` cannot carry a body, so an agent that skips step 5's form silently drops step 3's whole output.

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** SECRETS > 0 → STOP and block; never let a credential reach history.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** Push ONLY when the user explicitly said push; NEVER force-push or commit directly to main/master — go via PR.
