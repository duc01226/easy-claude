## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Generate and maintain E2E tests on the project's auto-detected framework with mandatory TC-code↔test traceability, producing a suite that runs, repeats deterministically, and provably maps every test back to its spec.

**Summary:**

- Read the project E2E reference + config FIRST — detect the framework (Playwright/Cypress/Selenium) before writing anything.
- Every test carries a `TC-{MODULE}-E2E-{NNN}` code — traceability back to the spec is mandatory.
- Use Page Object Model; derive stable selectors from `data-testid`/BEM/ARIA, never positional/generated ones; keep assertions out of page objects.
- Deterministic runs — unique GUID test data, explicit waits only, reused auth session; after fixing failures, record the learning back in the E2E reference doc.

**Workflow:**

1. **Read project E2E docs** — `docs/project-reference/e2e-test-reference.md`, `docs/project-config.json`
2. **Detect framework** — Playwright, Cypress, Selenium, etc.
3. **Load test specs** — find TC codes in feature docs
4. **Generate/update tests** — follow Page Object pattern
5. **Run tests** — project's configured commands
6. **Update docs** — add learnings to `docs/project-reference/e2e-test-reference.md`

**Key Rules:**

- NEVER fabricate file paths, function names, or behavior — investigate first, then act — why: a hallucinated selector or path passes review and fails only at runtime
- MUST ATTENTION include TC code (`TC-{MODULE}-E2E-{NNN}`) in every test — why: traceability is how a test proves which spec it covers
- NEVER hardcode brittle selectors — derive stable ones from `data-testid`, BEM classes, or ARIA roles — why: generated/positional selectors break on every unrelated markup change
- ALWAYS update visual baselines when UI changes — why: stale baselines turn real regressions into false failures
- MUST ATTENTION read the project E2E reference BEFORE any E2E work — why: local conventions override generic framework defaults

---

> **Evidence Gate** — Every claim, finding, and recommendation requires `file:line` proof or traced evidence. Confidence >80% to act; <80% must verify first. NEVER speculate without proof.
> **External Memory** — For complex or lengthy work (research, analysis, scan, review), write intermediate findings and final results to a report file in `plans/reports/` — prevents context loss.

## MANDATORY: Read Project E2E Reference (FIRST)

> **E2E Skill** — Detect framework from config, use Page Object Model, TC-code traceability mandatory, unique test data (GUIDs), explicit waits only, document preconditions. MUST ATTENTION READ `.claude/skills/e2e-test/SKILL.md` for the framework-detection table and detailed workflow.

**BEFORE ANY E2E WORK — run these, then act on results:**

```bash
head -100 docs/project-reference/e2e-test-reference.md  # Project-specific patterns
grep -A 50 '"e2eTesting"' docs/project-config.json       # Framework, paths, commands
grep -r "TC-.*-E2E-" docs/specs/  # Find TC codes
```

**When fixing E2E failures, MUST ATTENTION update `docs/project-reference/e2e-test-reference.md` with learnings — why: the next run starts from the lesson, not the same failure.**

## Core Principles

### TC Code Traceability (MANDATORY)

Every test MUST ATTENTION carry a TC code: `TC-{MODULE}-E2E-{NNN}`

```typescript
// TypeScript
test('TC-LR-E2E-001: Submit leave request', async () => { ... });
```

```csharp
// C# .NET
[Fact]
[Trait("TC", "TC-LR-E2E-001")]
public async Task SubmitLeaveRequest() { ... }
```

### Page Object Model

- Encapsulate locators in page classes; methods represent user actions
- Keep assertions in the test file, NEVER in the page object — why: a page object that asserts hides intent and can't be reused across tests

### Selector Strategy (Priority Order)

1. Semantic classes (BEM: `.block__element`)
2. Data attributes (`[data-testid]`, `[data-cy]`)
3. ARIA/Role (`role=button`, `aria-label`)
4. Text content (last resort)

**AVOID:** generated classes (`.ng-star-inserted`), positional selectors (`:nth-child`), XPath

### Test Data & Repeatability

- Append GUIDs to test data — NEVER depend on specific DB state — why: shared fixed data makes tests order-dependent and flaky
- Use explicit waits — NEVER arbitrary `sleep`/`timeout` — why: fixed sleeps are slow and still race the app
- Reuse auth session state — NEVER re-login each test — why: per-test login wastes runtime and adds a failure point
- Document preconditions (infrastructure, seed data, feature configs) — why: an undocumented precondition is a silent prerequisite the next runner can't satisfy

> **MANDATORY before ANY fix:**

<!-- SYNC:ai-mistake-prevention -->

> **AI Mistake Prevention** — Failure modes to avoid on every task:
>
> **Check downstream references before deleting.** Deleting components causes documentation and code staleness cascades. Map all referencing files before removal.
> **Verify AI-generated content against actual code.** AI hallucinates APIs, class names, and method signatures. Always grep to confirm existence before documenting or referencing.
> **Trace full dependency chain after edits.** Changing a definition misses downstream variables and consumers derived from it. Always trace the full chain.
> **Trace ALL code paths when verifying correctness.** Confirming code exists is not confirming it executes. Always trace early exits, error branches, and conditional skips — not just happy path.
> **When debugging, ask "whose responsibility?" before fixing.** Trace whether bug is in caller (wrong data) or callee (wrong handling). Fix at responsible layer — never patch symptom site.
> **Assume existing values are intentional — ask WHY before changing.** Before changing any constant, limit, flag, or pattern: read comments, check git blame, examine surrounding code.
> **Verify ALL affected outputs, not just the first.** Changes touching multiple stacks require verifying EVERY output. One green check is not all green checks.
> **Holistic-first debugging — resist nearest-attention trap.** When investigating any failure, list EVERY precondition first (config, env vars, DB names, endpoints, DI registrations, data preconditions), then verify each against evidence before forming any code-layer hypothesis.
> **Surgical changes — apply the diff test.** Bug fix: every changed line must trace directly to the bug. Don't restyle or improve adjacent code. Enhancement task: implement improvements AND announce them explicitly.
> **Surface ambiguity before coding — don't pick silently.** If request has multiple interpretations, present each with effort estimate and ask. Never assume all-records, file-based, or more complex path.
> **Keep domain concepts out of generic/shared/infrastructure layers.** A reusable layer (shared library, framework, infra module) must reference NO consumer-specific domain concept — tenant/customer/product IDs, business entities, feature rules. The leak compiles and runs, so it passes review silently while coupling the "reusable" layer to one consumer. Push domain fields/logic down into the consumer via subclass or composition.

<!-- SYNC:source-test-drift-check -->

> **Source/test drift check.** For coding, fix, debug, investigation, test, or review work: when source behavior changes, inspect affected unit/integration/E2E tests and decide from evidence whether tests should change to match intended behavior or the source change is an unintended bug to fix. Do not write tests for migration code; schema/data migrations are one-time execution paths, not core application logic.

<!-- SYNC:repeatable-test-principle -->

> **Infinitely Repeatable Tests** — Tests MUST run N times without failure. Like manual QC — run the suite 100 times, each run just adds more data. Verification is only PASS after the relevant suite/project passes 3 consecutive runs without database reset.
>
> 1. **Unique data per run:** Use the project's unique ID generator for ALL entity IDs created in tests. NEVER hardcode IDs.
> 2. **Additive only:** Tests create data, never delete/reset. Prior test runs MUST NOT interfere with current run.
> 3. **No schema rollback dependency:** Tests work with current schema only. Never rely on schema rollback or migration reversals.
> 4. **Idempotent seeders:** Fixture-level seeders use create-if-missing pattern (check existence before insert). Test-level data uses unique IDs per execution.
> 5. **No cleanup required:** No teardown, no database reset between runs. Each test is isolated by unique seed data, not by cleanup.
> 6. **Unique names/codes:** When entities require unique names/codes, append a unique suffix using the project's ID generator.
> 7. **Migration code excluded:** Do not write tests for migration code. Schema/data migrations are one-time execution paths, not core application logic.
