// Regression lock for the cross-surface mirror-drift class fixed this session:
//   1. A standalone `prettier --write` reformatted AGENTS.md and drifted its mirror block off
//      .codex/CODEX_CONTEXT.md, FAILing verify-skill-protocol-compliance.
//   2. There was no single entrypoint to sync+verify the codex surfaces, so a one-surface sync
//      left the others silently stale.
// These tests fail loudly if either guard is removed — keeping the sync pipeline the sole writer
// of generated-mirror bytes, and keeping one command that re-establishes full cross-surface parity.

// PORT-011 locks the guard to resolve true here, so a rename cannot silently skip them.
