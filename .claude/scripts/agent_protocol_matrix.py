"""Agent <-> quality-protocol-block adoption matrix (single source of truth).

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
--------------------
Sub-agents under ``.claude/agents/*.md`` are wired into block *body* sync
(``sync-update-blocks.py`` targets agents too), but the role-specific
``inject_*`` coverage campaigns only ever targeted *skills*. Result: every
agent carries the same generic baseline and ZERO role-specific rigor -- the
flagship ``code-reviewer`` agent had none of the 14 review-quality blocks its
twin ``code-review`` / ``changes-review`` skills carry. This module is the
manifest that closes that gap: per-agent, which QUALITY blocks to ADD.

POLICY: QUALITY propagates, ORCHESTRATION does not
--------------------------------------------------
Skill protocol blocks split into two classes (research/agent-skill-mapping.md
section 3). Only the first propagates to a headless leaf sub-agent:

  * QUALITY / RIGOR  -> adopt into agents (severity-rubric,
    root-cause-debugging, estimation-framework, ...). These raise the craft of
    the agent's own output when the block matches the agent's role.
    Review-cycle quality blocks are additionally constrained by
    ``REVIEW_CYCLE_AGENTS`` below.
  * ORCHESTRATION / INTERACTION  -> do NOT blanket-copy (``EXCLUDED_ORCHESTRATION``
    below). A sub-agent runs headless under a caller: it does not expand workflow
    steps, does not choose/return-contract its own sub-agents, and does not drive
    the AskUserQuestion dialog. Copying these would tell the agent to perform
    actions it structurally cannot. The ONE exception is curated per-agent in
    ``ORCHESTRATION_WHITELIST`` (framework-maintainer reasons ABOUT sub-agent
    design as its subject matter, so ``sub-agent-selection`` is content for it).

CANONICAL-SOURCE RULE
---------------------
This module stores only block *names* (tags). The block *bodies* are ALWAYS
sourced at injection time from the canonical registry
``.claude/skills/shared/sync-inline-versions.md`` via
``sync_blocks.load_wrapped_sync_block`` -- never hand-typed here. ``validate()``
hard-fails on any tag absent from that registry (catches hallucinated tags).

TARGET-SET INVARIANT
--------------------
Each agent's list is the FULL set of quality blocks that agent should carry --
a persistent declarative target, not a one-shot delta. A block the agent already
carries STAYS listed: the manifest is the single source of truth for intended
per-agent state, so an audit can read the target here instead of reconstructing
it from 26 agent files.

Injection is therefore idempotent, not additive. The injector skips a block the
agent already carries (``inject_agent_protocol_blocks.py`` marks it ``present``)
and writes only the absent ones, so the REAL dry-run insert count is the number
of declared blocks NOT yet present -- see ``pending_insertions()``. Never report
the manifest's size as an insert count; at steady state every block is present
and a real run inserts zero.

``validate()`` check (c) warns on the inverse condition: a declared block MISSING
from its agent, meaning the manifest moved ahead of the agent files and the
injector has not been run. The skill-connection manifest below is a second,
explicit link: it tells every agent which canonical skill contract owns the
role-specific behavior. It is rendered into each agent prompt by
``inject_agent_skill_connections.py`` so the connection survives Claude/Codex
mirror generation without blanket-injecting orchestrator instructions.

SPAWN-CAPABILITY GUARD (/why-review F-WR2)
------------------------------------------
``SPAWN_INSTRUCTING_BLOCKS`` literally instruct the agent to spawn ``Agent`` /
``Task`` sub-agents. ``validate()`` hard-fails if any agent assigned one of these
lacks ``Agent``/``Task`` in its frontmatter ``tools`` (and is not an all-tools
grant). Zero violations today (every spawn-instructed agent is all-tools); the
guard catches the silent future failure mode where a no-spawn agent inherits a
block instructing an impossible action.

AGENT TIER POLICY (mirror sync-hooks-to-skills.py + TC-UAR-004)
--------------------------------------------------------------
``CODE_TIER_TAGS`` are code-investigation blocks that belong ONLY on
code-touching agents. A ``CORE_ONLY`` agent (research/docs/product/governance
role) must carry NONE of them -- the framework enforces this via TC-UAR-004.
``validate()`` check (e) mirrors that rule so a tier leak (e.g. a research agent
inheriting ``understand-code-first``) hard-fails HERE, before injection, instead
of slipping through to the framework test gate.

CONSUMERS
---------
``inject_agent_protocol_blocks.py`` imports ``AGENT_QUALITY_BLOCKS``,
``FAMILIES``, ``EXCLUDED_ORCHESTRATION`` and ``SPAWN_INSTRUCTING_BLOCKS`` from
here. Run ``python .claude/scripts/agent_protocol_matrix.py --validate`` to
self-check before any injection.
