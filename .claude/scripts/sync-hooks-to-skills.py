"""
sync-hooks-to-skills.py
Inserts SYNC: blocks sourced from canonical (sync-inline-versions.md) into all
SKILL.md and agent .md files. Idempotent: skips files that already contain a block.
A guide entry (`sync_blocks.has_guide_entry`) counts as the block, so a skill converted
to guide lines never gets its body back. Files keep their own line-ending style.

The universal bundle (the `universal` group of `protocol-groups.json`) is never inserted here: the
universal hook delivers it and no skill or agent carries any part of it (`sync_blocks.strip_universal`;
`sync-update-blocks.py --mode=strip-root-pointer` applies it to the whole tree). `main()` also
brings each target to that contract.

Tiered blocks (agents):
  Core-2 (every agent):
    - SYNC:sequential-thinking-protocol
    - SYNC:agent-bootstrap
    (`task-tracking-external-report` is folded into agent-bootstrap and never inserted.)
  Code-6 (Core-2 + 4, for code/review agents in CODE_AGENTS):
    - SYNC:understand-code-first
    - SYNC:evidence-based-reasoning
    - SYNC:cross-service-check
    - SYNC:fix-layer-accountability
  Readonly-Code-4 (Core-2 + 2, for read-only/design agents in READONLY_CODE_AGENTS):
    - SYNC:understand-code-first
    - SYNC:evidence-based-reasoning
    (EXCLUDES cross-service-check + fix-layer-accountability — those two are
    mutation-oriented and waste tokens on agents that only locate/read/design
    code and never fix at a layer or cross a service boundary.)
  agent-code-standards (gated INDEPENDENTLY by CODE_STANDARDS_AGENTS — NOT the
  same set as CODE_AGENTS): dev-rules + coding-pattern pointers for agents that
  write/modify/review/debug/optimize/test code. Appended on top of whichever tier
  (Core or Code) the agent already has. Non-code-standards agents never receive it.
Skills carry no inserted blocks (both skill tier orders are empty). `--prune` removes a PRUNABLE_BLOCKS block from
any file whose tier no longer grants it — without it, leaving a tier is a one-way
door.

Agent tier is set by explicit CODE_AGENTS / READONLY_CODE_AGENTS /
CORE_ONLY_AGENTS membership; an agent in none of the three sets (or in more than
one) raises (no silent default).
agent-code-standards membership (CODE_STANDARDS_AGENTS) is a SEPARATE axis: an
agent can be in CODE_AGENTS (code-investigation tier) yet NOT in
CODE_STANDARDS_AGENTS (e.g. researcher/ui-ux-designer read or locate code
but do not author/review it), and vice versa.

Insertion point: all SYNC blocks (main + :reminder variants) are inserted as ONE
group in the bottom zone, immediately BEFORE the `## Closing Reminders` section
(or appended at EOF when that section is absent). Main blocks precede reminder
variants. Canonical layout: ...main body... -> SYNC main -> SYNC reminders ->
## Closing Reminders. Markers are emitted left-flush (matches refactor_*_layout.py).
