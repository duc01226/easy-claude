/**
 * Help text for every config option whose schema entry carries no inline `describe`.
 * Covers project-config (project-config-schema.cjs SCHEMA) and .ck.json (ck-config-schema.cjs CK_SCHEMA).
 *
 * Read ONLY by the help commands (project-config --help, /ck-help config) and the
 * config-help-coverage test — never by hooks, so it adds nothing to hook start-up.
 *
 * Rule: a schema entry's own `describe` wins; this file supplies the rest. A new schema
 * field needs one or the other — config-help-coverage.test.cjs fails when a field has neither,
 * or when a key here no longer names a schema field.
 *
 * Paths: `a.b` nested property · `a[].b` field of each array item · `a{}` map value.
