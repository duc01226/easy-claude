## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Synthesize every in-scope session idea, Feature Spec, PBI, user story, design-spec, and mockup into ONE project-faithful standalone HTML deck with a vanilla-JS engine and interactive MVP demos for every main journey, so PO/BA/Dev/QC review the feature from one offline file before build.

**Summary:**

- **Purpose / altitude:** a SYNTHESIS deck at a higher altitude than `pbi --mode=mockup` — accumulates many artifacts (ideas + specs + PBIs + stories + design-specs + mockups) into ONE stakeholder presentation, not one PBI's UI preview.
- **Main steps (read-this-if-nothing-else):** (1) resolve `activePlan` scope across created→now → (2) gap-fill: missing PBIs → ask once (`manual` tier), on a yes run `workflow-spec-to-pbi` as a SUB-AGENT, else report the gap; missing mockups in `idea-to-pbi` use `pbi --mode=mockup`, `idea-to-spec` skips mockups → (3) load design context → (4) [BLOCKING] inventory UI + flows → (5) extract journeys, one todo each → (6) assemble → (7) save → (8) [BLOCKING] `review`-profile conformance check, then fidelity/demo integrity → (8b) Demo-Quality → (9) report.
- **Output/demo contract:** exactly ONE HTML at `{artifacts-root}/presentations/{YYMMDD}-presentation-{slug}.html` (`{artifacts-root}` defaults to `team-artifacts`; a `docsRoots.teamArtifacts.path` entry in `docs/project-config.json` overrides the path) with inline CSS/JS, self-contained; outside assets only with the deck's declared asset policy (added automatically when an embedded prototype loads an outside asset); project or system type, no CDN/reveal.js, vanilla-JS navigation, speaker notes on every slide, a guide slide, and one interactive demo-flow slide per main journey; reuse existing `*-mockup.html` via escaped `<iframe srcdoc>` and accept only complete PBI full flows. The deck meets `presentation-builder`'s deck standard and passes its validator with `--profile=review` before it is reported ready.
- **Branches and evidence:** evaluate shared `isLargeIdea`; true requires the complete `large_idea_decomposition` block, stable slice IDs, and Decomposition & boundaries beside the all-PBI backlog and all-PBI presentation; missing/conflicting fields block deck quality and the presentation never creates the product roadmap artifact (default `docs/product-roadmap.md`; a `docsRoots.productRoadmap.path` entry in `docs/project-config.json` overrides the path). `idea-to-spec` uses only design-spec ASCII/tables + narrated frames; missing visuals render an empty state; use real domain data and keep prose tech-agnostic.

**Workflow:**

1. **Resolve scope** — anchor on `activePlan`, accumulate its full artifact set across the plan's created→now date range (every `{YYMMDD}` in range, NOT just today); custom prompt widens; standalone + no prompt → ask the user directly.
2. **Gap-fill (smart routing — sub-agent)** — spec lacks PBIs → ask once (`manual` tier), on a yes `workflow-spec-to-pbi` AS A SUB-AGENT, else report the gap; PBIs lack mockups (mockup-bearing workflow) → `pbi --mode=mockup`. Spec-only `idea-to-spec` → SKIP mockup generation.
3. **Load project design context** — baseline + matched per-app design-system docs via `project-config.json`.
4. **[BLOCKING] Inventory existing UI + map connected flows** — `SYNC:existing-ui-research`.
5. **Accumulate + structure content (incl. journey extraction)** — parse each artifact into stakeholder sections; extract the main-story flows into an ordered journey list + task tracking one todo per journey; REAL domain data, never Lorem (`references/artifact-accumulation.md`).
6. **Assemble ONE standalone HTML deck** — inline CSS (design tokens, BEM) + vanilla-JS engine + speaker notes on every slide + a "How to use this deck" guide slide + one interactive demo-flow slide per journey (embedded mockup + narration strip) + `<iframe srcdoc>` mockup embeds, each raw mockup scanned for outside assets first; spec-only path renders ASCII/tables + narrated ASCII frames; empty-state slide when no visual exists (`references/deck-template.md`).
7. **Save** → `{artifacts-root}/presentations/{YYMMDD}-presentation-{slug}.html` (see "Path roots").
8. **[BLOCKING] Conformance check, then fidelity gate (incl. demo integrity)** — `validate-presentation.cjs <deck.html> --profile=review` must exit 0 (fix and re-check until it does); then validate deck visuals + every journey clicks through vs Step 4 inventory; record `Conformance (review): PASS` and `Fidelity vs existing UI: PASS|FAIL` (`references/deck-template.md`).
8b. **[BLOCKING] Demo-Quality review** — final stakeholder-comprehension pass; record `Demo quality: PASS|FAIL`.
9. **Report** — path, artifact count synthesized, demo journeys, stakeholder sections, conformance + browser-behavior + fidelity + demo-quality verdicts.

**Key Rules:**

- Emit exactly ONE self-contained HTML file; inline CSS/JS; type from the project's design tokens or the system stack (a web font the picked design-explore draft loaded is kept only by packaging its font file inside the deck — otherwise the project's type token, then the closest system stack, recorded as a departure); no external `<script src>` / `<link rel=stylesheet>` / `url(https://…)` in the deck's own markup; outside assets only with the deck's declared asset policy (added automatically when an embedded prototype loads an outside asset); no CDN reveal.js — vanilla-JS engine only.
- [BLOCKING] Never report the deck ready while `validate-presentation.cjs --profile=review` fails — fix the deck and re-check (Step 8); `presentation-builder` owns the deck standard and that validator.
- Present every in-scope main user story as an interactive MVP demo slide (embedded interactive mockup + narration strip); plan journeys first (Step 5, one todo each), sign off with the Demo-Quality review (Step 8b).
- Embed existing `-mockup.html` via `<iframe srcdoc>` — never regenerate a mockup that already exists; the mock-up is self-driving, the deck adds only narration.
- Spec-only `idea-to-spec` → design-spec ASCII wireframes + inventory/states/tokens tables + narrated ASCII-frame step-through ONLY; never generate HTML mockups, never invoke `pbi --mode=mockup`.
- Use REAL domain entity field names + realistic sample data — never Lorem ipsum or "Item 1, Item 2".
- Empty-state slide when an in-scope feature has no mockup AND no design-spec — never a broken/blank iframe.
- Run gap-fill multi-step workflows as SUB-AGENTS (summary returned + findings written to `tmp/reports/`) per CLAUDE.md "Workflow Step Advancement §3".
- Keep accompanying prose/captions tech-agnostic (business/observable terms, not framework/CSS class names); the rendered HTML may use real class names internally.

**Be skeptical. Apply critical thinking, sequential thinking. Every claim needs traced proof, confidence percentages (Idea should be more than 80%).**

# Feature Presentation — Stakeholder HTML Slide Deck

Synthesize session specs, PBIs, ideas, and mockups into one standalone HTML deck for PO/BA/Dev/QC.

---

## When to Use

- Near the end of `workflow-idea-to-pbi` or `workflow-idea-to-spec`, to present the feature set to stakeholders.
- Standalone, when PO/BA/Dev/QC need one offline deck synthesizing a feature's ideas, specs, PBIs, stories, and mockups.

**NOT for**: one PBI UI preview (`$pbi --mode=mockup`), Feature Spec authoring (`$spec`), or design-spec production (`$design-spec`). General-subject decks go to `$presentation-builder` (user-run) — a talk, briefing, teaching or pitch deck that does not synthesize a feature's ideas/specs/PBIs/mockups.

**Deck standard:** `presentation-builder` owns the deck standard (runtime contract `presentation-builder/references/web-runtime-contract.md`) and its validator `presentation-builder/scripts/validate-presentation.cjs`. This skill's review deck conforms to that standard under the `review` profile and passes it before hand-off (Step 8). For a read-only review deck that profile makes five checks advisory — in-place editing, editing state, local draft saving, draft reset and clean export — and keeps every other check at the same level as the `presenter` profile; the Presentation Decks spec rule BR-PD-03 owns that list, mirrored in the runtime contract's §9 "Conformance profiles" and the validator — change it there first.

## Quick Reference

### Path roots (resolve before reading or writing any path below)

- `{artifacts-root}` — the team-artifacts root: default `team-artifacts`; a `docsRoots.teamArtifacts.path` entry in `docs/project-config.json` overrides the path.
- `{spec-root}` — the business Feature Spec root: default `docs/specs`; a `specRoots.business.path` entry in `docs/project-config.json` overrides the path.

Both placeholders stand for the RESOLVED value everywhere they appear in this skill; write the resolved path into every deck, report, and sub-agent brief — never the placeholder.

### Input

| Source        | Path                                                         |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Ideas         | `{artifacts-root}/ideas/{YYMMDD}-*`                          |
| PBIs          | `{artifacts-root}/pbis/{YYMMDD}-pbi-*.md`                    |
| User stories  | `{artifacts-root}/pbis/stories/{YYMMDD}-us-*.md`             |
| Mockups       | `{artifacts-root}/pbis/*-mockup.html`                        |
| Design specs  | `{artifacts-root}/design-specs/{YYMMDD}-designspec-*.md`     |
| Feature Specs | `{spec-root}/{Bucket}/README.{Feature}.md`                   |
| Active plan   | `activePlan` in the OS-temp `CK_TMP_DIR/session/{id}.json` (the path returned by `getSessionStatePath`, written by `set-active-plan.cjs`) |
| Explicit scope | User provides specs/features as argument                    |

### Output

| Type       | Path                                                          |

- **Detail:** `references/deck-template.md` (HTML scaffold + slide engine + iframe-srcdoc escaping + fidelity gate); `references/artifact-accumulation.md` (scope resolution + per-type parse map + gap-fill + branches)

---

## Detailed Workflow

### Step 1: Resolve Scope

Determine deck scope; full algorithm: `references/artifact-accumulation.md` → "Scope Resolution".

1. **Default (active-plan anchor):** Read `activePlan` from `CK_TMP_DIR/session/{id}.json` (path returned by `getSessionStatePath`, written by `.claude/scripts/set-active-plan.cjs`). Accumulate the plan's FULL artifact set across its **created→now date range** — glob `team-artifacts/{ideas,pbis,pbis/stories,design-specs}` and `*-mockup.html` for EVERY `{YYMMDD}` in range, plus plan `docs/specs` outputs. **Both roots in that glob are DEFAULTS** — keep the brace expression exactly as written and swap the `team-artifacts` / `docs/specs` prefixes for `{artifacts-root}` / `{spec-root}` whenever `docsRoots.teamArtifacts.path` / `specRoots.business.path` are declared in `docs/project-config.json`.
    - **Multi-day rule:** a workflow that spans midnight authors specs on day 1 and PBIs on day 2 — a single-day `{YYMMDD}` glob silently drops day-1 artifacts. Glob over the whole created→now range, never just today.
2. **Custom prompt:** If user names specs/features, widen scope to those artifacts plus dependents.
3. **Standalone + no prompt:** Use ask the user directly to ask which specs/ideas to present — never silently guess scope.

### Step 2: Gap-Fill (Smart Routing — Sub-Agent)

Fill missing downstream artifacts; routing: `references/artifact-accumulation.md` → "Gap-Fill Routing".

1. **Spec lacks PBIs:** `workflow-spec-to-pbi` is a `manual`-tier workflow — ask the user once whether to run it; only on a yes, invoke it **AS A SUB-AGENT** (`spawn_agent` tool), briefed to run `$start-workflow workflow-spec-to-pbi` and told the user explicitly said yes — that yes is the explicit request the tier needs, since a sub-agent's own `$start-workflow` call never counts as one; otherwise report the missing PBIs and continue. Per CLAUDE.md "Workflow Step Advancement §3", multi-step workflows run as sub-agents: return a summary and write full findings to `tmp/reports/` to bound deck-build context.
2. **PBIs lack `-mockup.html` AND workflow is mockup-bearing (`idea-to-pbi`):** Invoke `pbi --mode=mockup` per PBI; require its Releasable Full-Flow gate to PASS before embedding.
3. **Spec-only `idea-to-spec` context:** SKIP mockup generation — never invoke `pbi --mode=mockup`; use design-spec visuals only (Step 6 spec-only path), preserving the no-mockup contract.

### Step 3: Load Project Design Context

Deck CSS uses project design tokens (same discovery as `pbi --mode=mockup`):

0. **Design-explore hand-off (when supplied):** a `$ui-design --mode=explore` run whose deliverable was a Slide hands over `direction-approved.md` and `run-notes.md`. Read the Design Plan tokens from the `## Design Plan tokens` section of `direction-approved.md` and adopt the approved direction as the deck's look — its colours and type become the CSS variables; the steps below still fill any axis it leaves open. Read the journey fixes from the `## Journey fixes (UX-8)` section of `run-notes.md` and apply each to the slide map, recording each fix as applied or `N/A — <reason>` in the Step 9 hand-off line. A web font the picked draft loaded is kept only by packaging its font file inside the deck (an embedded font file — the deck still loads nothing from a network, Step 6); otherwise it is replaced by the project's type token, then the closest system stack, and the replacement is recorded as a departure in the Step 9 hand-off line.

1. **Mandatory baseline:** Read `design-system/README.md` and `design-system/design-system-canonical.md` under the project-reference root (default `docs/project-reference`; a `docsRoots.projectReference.path` entry in `docs/project-config.json` overrides the path).
2. **Primary:** Read top-level `designSystem` in `docs/project-config.json` — use `designSystem.docsPath` + `designSystem.canonicalDoc`, then match the presented feature/app context against `designSystem.appMappings[]` to select the per-app doc.
3. **Fallback:** `Glob("docs/project-reference/design-system/*.md")` → case-insensitive substring match on app/feature name. **Default:** `README.md`. The glob's `docs/project-reference` prefix is the DEFAULT root; substitute the value of `docsRoots.projectReference.path` from `docs/project-config.json` when it is declared, leaving the rest of the pattern unchanged.
4. Extract colors, typography, spacing, border-radius, shadows → these become the deck's CSS variables.

### Step 4: [BLOCKING] Inventory Existing UI + Map Connected Flows

> **[BLOCKING] Complete `SYNC:existing-ui-research` before assembly:** inventory related UI, not generic HTML; classify Common/Domain-Shared/Page components with base/owner; map connected flows; reuse before inventing; record findings. Skip only backend-only work and state that explicitly.

1. Read the first 200 lines of `frontend-patterns-reference.md` in the project-reference root (default `docs/project-reference`; a `docsRoots.projectReference.path` entry in `docs/project-config.json` overrides the path) — base components, form/table/dialog patterns.
2. Sample 2–3 real shared/module components for layout and CSS naming.
3. Map connected feature flows so embedded visuals fit surrounding navigation.

### Step 5: Accumulate + Structure Content (incl. journey extraction — think → plan → many todos)

Parse each in-scope artifact into stakeholder slide sections (see Slide Taxonomy); parse map: `references/artifact-accumulation.md` → "Per-Artifact-Type Parse Map".

- Use REAL domain entity field names + realistic sample data from `domain-entities-reference.md` in the project-reference root (default `docs/project-reference`; a `docsRoots.projectReference.path` entry in `docs/project-config.json` overrides the path) — never Lorem ipsum or "Item 1, Item 2".
- Keep accompanying prose/captions tech-agnostic (business/observable terms, not framework/CSS class names).
- **Extract each PBI's priority/rank** — read the `priority` label + numeric `rank` from each PBI's frontmatter (and the ranked-order backlog artifact `{artifacts-root}/backlog/*-backlog.md` when present). The Scope & backlog slide MUST display PBIs in ranked order with a priority label per PBI card — the deck carries the same priority info the backlog and mockups do. If PBIs lack priority, note it explicitly rather than dropping the field.
- **Extract the decomposition context** — locate the owning idea/spec/PBI block; evaluate shared `isLargeIdea`; when any signal is true, validate all five `large_idea_decomposition` fields (`outcome_slices`, `dependencies_order`, `non_goals`, `risks_evidence`, `deferred_work_owner`) and preserve each slice ID through every PBI/story/mockup. Add a Decomposition & boundaries slide (or equivalent Scope & backlog section) with dependency order, non-goals, evidence owners, and deferred-work ownership. If all signals are false, record `Decomposition: N/A — ordinary isolated scope` and do not invent a roadmap section.
- **Extract the main-story / MVP flows into an ordered journey list** — from PBI `## Acceptance Criteria` GIVEN/WHEN/THEN + story "As a / I want / So that" + each mock-up's flow-specs (`references/artifact-accumulation.md` §6 Journey-Extraction Map). One journey per main user story (MVP happy path), each an ordered sequence: entry → click steps ("click X → see Y → move to Z") → end state + one plain-language explanation per step. When a `-mockup.html` exists, reuse its flow-specs verbatim so the deck demo == the per-PBI prototype.
- **task tracking one todo per journey slide** — so each journey is assembled (Step 6) and later verified (Step 8 demo integrity / final demo-quality review) individually. (The "think → plan → many todos before do".)

### Step 6: Assemble ONE Standalone HTML Deck

Build the single self-contained HTML from `references/deck-template.md`:

- Inline `<style>` — design-token CSS variables, BEM classes, light/dark themes; font stack from the project's design tokens, else the system stack — never a web-font link in the deck's own markup; a web font the picked design-explore draft loaded is kept only by packaging its font file inside the deck, otherwise it is replaced by the project's type token, then the closest system stack, and recorded as a departure (Step 3 item 0, Step 9).
- Every slide is a `<section class="slide deck__slide">` with an `<h2>` title and its own speaker notes (`references/deck-template.md` §1) — no slide ships without notes. Slide bodies never nest `<section>`: the checker ends a slide at the first `</section>`, so group content inside a slide with `<div>`.
- Vanilla-JS slide engine from the §1 scaffold — Previous/Next buttons, arrow keys, PageUp/PageDown, Space (Shift+Space goes back), `Home`/`End`, All slides (overview), Notes, fullscreen, theme toggle, and a "Slide N of M" status; no nav dots, no CDN reveal.js. On a slide whose content overflows, the vertical keys scroll it first and change slide only at its edge; while Tab has put the focus in the notes they scroll only the notes, even at the notes' edge, and move neither the page nor the slide (runtime contract §3). Key presses inside an embedded demo stay in the demo; OPTIONAL `postMessage('play')` auto-starts a journey only when supported (`references/deck-template.md` §3b).
- **"How to use this deck" guide slide** near the top — teach navigation (Previous/Next and the arrow, PageUp/PageDown, Space, `Home`/`End` keys), All slides (overview), Notes and Escape to close them, Tab into the notes to scroll them (there the scroll keys move only the notes; press Tab or click outside them to move the deck again), each mock-up's hotspots and ▶ Play / ⏮ ⏭ / ↺ Reset demo controls, leaving a demo (after clicking into one, click outside it, or press Tab until you leave it, to use the arrow keys for slides again), and Full screen and Dark theme (`references/deck-template.md` §3b).
- **Outside-asset scan (before escaping each raw `-mockup.html`):** search the raw mockup, case-insensitively (flag `i`), with the regex `(?<![\w-])(?:src|poster|data)\s*=\s*["']?\s*(?:https?:)?//|(?<![\w-])srcset\s*=\s*["']?[^"'>]*//|<(?:link|image|use)\b[^>]*?(?<![\w-])(?:xlink:)?href\s*=\s*["']?\s*(?:https?:)?//|url\(\s*["']?\s*(?:https?:)?//|@import\s*["']?\s*(?:https?:)?//` — it uses look-behind, so run it as a JavaScript RegExp with the `i` flag (`new RegExp(pattern, 'i')` in node) or with `grep -Pi` / `rg --pcre2 -i`; never `grep -E` or plain `rg`, which miss every hit silently or refuse the pattern. It flags only what the mockup LOADS from a network address (protocol-relative `//` included): a `src`, `poster` or `data` (object) attribute, a network address anywhere in a `srcset`, a `<link>` (or SVG `<image>`/`<use>`) `href`, a `url(…)`, or an `@import` with or without a space. A plain link (`<a href="https://…">`), a `data-src`-style attribute and an address shown as text are not loads and are not flagged. Any hit in any mockup → add `<meta name="presentation-asset-policy" content="external-allowed">` to the deck's `<head>` and put the viewer notice "Demos load outside assets; open online to see them exactly." on the how-to slide — demos need a network to show them exactly. No hit in any mockup → no meta, no notice. Record `Outside assets: declared ({N} mockups) | none`. The deck's own markup never loads an outside asset either way.
- **Demo-flow slides (one per Step 5 journey):** embed flow-scoped interactive `pbi --mode=mockup` HTML via escaped `<iframe srcdoc="…escaped…">` with a text-only narration strip beside the embed (never over it) listing each step with a plain-language explanation and "⚠ Simulated". Controls stay inside the self-driving mock-up; the deck adds no duplicate interactivity (`references/deck-template.md` §3b).
- **Mockup-bearing path (`idea-to-pbi`):** embed each existing `-mockup.html` via `<iframe srcdoc="…escaped…">`; use `&`-first, escape-once-unconditionally from `references/deck-template.md`. Never regenerate an existing mockup.
- **Decomposition integrity:** the deck aggregates; it must not split, merge, rename, or reinterpret slice IDs. Flag conflicts to the owning PBI/spec/refine step and stop fidelity validation until resolved.
- **Spec-only path (`idea-to-spec`):** render design-spec ASCII wireframes plus Component Inventory / States / Design-Tokens tables; each journey is a narrated wireframe demo with ONE SLIDE PER ASCII FRAME, so Next advances the frames — ids `demo-{journey-slug}`, `demo-{journey-slug}-2`, `demo-{journey-slug}-3`, … — each slide an escaped `<pre class="deck__wireframe">` made a named, focusable region (`tabindex="0" role="region" aria-label`) with no iframe and no empty-state line, keeping its narration and "⚠ Simulated" note (`references/deck-template.md` §3b "Spec-only wireframe demo"). NO `<iframe srcdoc>` mockup, NEVER invoke `pbi --mode=mockup`.
- **Escape inserted text:** every value placed into a `{…}` placeholder (element text or attribute value) and every ASCII wireframe is HTML-escaped once before insertion, `&` first, then `<` `>` `"` `'` (`references/deck-template.md` §1 "Escape every inserted value"). An unescaped `</section>` in inserted text ends the slide early for the conformance check — a deck defect to fix.
- **Continuation slides:** a job that needs more than one slide keeps its id and numbers each continuation from 2 (`rules`, `rules-2`) so every `data-slide-id` stays unique and job-named.
- **Empty-state (F3):** when a feature has NO `-mockup.html` AND NO design-spec, render "No prototype or design available for {feature}" — never a broken/blank iframe; drop that slide's "⚠ Simulated" note and use the no-visual notes variant (`references/deck-template.md` §3b).

### Step 7: Save

- **Path:** `{artifacts-root}/presentations/{YYMMDD}-presentation-{slug}.html` — `{artifacts-root}` defaults to `team-artifacts` and is relocated by a `docsRoots.teamArtifacts.path` entry in `docs/project-config.json` (create the `presentations/` dir under it if absent).
- `{slug}` = the presented feature(s) or plan slug.

### Step 8: [BLOCKING] Conformance Check, then Fidelity Validation — Deck Matches Existing UI

> **[BLOCKING] Conformance check first — run `presentation-builder`'s validator with the `review` profile on the saved deck:**
>
> ```
> node .claude/skills/presentation-builder/scripts/validate-presentation.cjs <deck.html> --profile=review
> ```
>
> Exit 0 is required. Exit 1 → fix every failed check in the deck and re-run until it exits 0. Exit 2 → a usage or read error: report it with its stderr and treat the check as not passed. **Never report the deck ready while the check fails** — a failing deck is fixed and re-checked, never handed off.
>
> **Checker defect:** if a failed check names something the deck visibly satisfies (for example notes reported missing on a slide that has them), treat it as a checker defect — stop the fix loop, report the check, the slide and the evidence to the user, and do not report the deck ready. First confirm no slide body nests `<section>` and no inserted text or wireframe carries an unescaped `<`, `&` or `</section>` (Step 6): the checker ends a slide at the first `</section>`, so either one is a deck defect to fix, not a checker defect.

Alongside the check, confirm the outside-asset contract: search the deck with every `srcdoc="…"` attribute value removed using the Step 6 regex, case-insensitively, in a look-behind engine (a JavaScript RegExp with the `i` flag, `grep -Pi` or `rg --pcre2 -i`; never `grep -E` or plain `rg`) — the deck's own markup must load nothing, so it has zero hits (a plain `<a href>` link in notes or evidence is not a load and does not count); the `presentation-asset-policy` meta is present exactly when the Step 6 mockup scan found an outside asset.

A static PASS is not browser proof. Record the browser behaviors — notes open/close/Escape, overview focus, keyboard navigation (including clicker keys after a button click), keyboard scroll-then-advance on an overflowing slide at 200% zoom / narrow width, notes readable by keyboard at 125–150% zoom with the deck not moving while the focus is in them, notes panel visible when opened at narrow width, text and control contrast in both themes after token substitution, print, reduced motion (no smooth scrolling, no demo auto-play), the screen-reader names of the controls and the notes panel, and the no-JavaScript fallback (every slide readable as one page, controls hidden) — each as browser-verified or `NOT VERIFIABLE`; never fold an unexercised behavior into the PASS.

> **[BLOCKING] After the conformance check passes, run `references/deck-template.md` → "[BLOCKING] Fidelity Gate" against the Step 4 UI inventory.** Do NOT report done until a result is recorded.

The gate also covers **demo integrity** — every journey slide clicks end-to-end in its iframe, reaches its end state via real hotspots, has no dead controls, lists each step with a plain-language explanation in tech-agnostic narration (M1/M2), shows "⚠ Simulated", and advances spec-only ASCII frames one slide per frame without an empty-state line beside the wireframe.

**Optional render evidence (when html-export is installed):** `node .claude/skills/html-export/scripts/export.cjs --to=png <deck.html> --slides=section.deck__slide` captures every slide. Exit 0 is evidence ONLY for first-load and per-slide render, zero page errors, and no blank captures; demo click-through and the other gate items stay `NOT VERIFIABLE` unless exercised another way. **html-export exit rule:** exit 0 → evidence as scoped; exit 4 → fix the page and re-run; exit 3 → `NOT VERIFIABLE` plus a one-line pointer to `$html-export` setup, never run install commands; exit 1/2 → tool failure: quote stderr, mark `NOT VERIFIABLE`, never count it as a design defect or a pass; any other code (such as 130 after an interrupt) → handle it like 1/2; evidence is only the files this run's manifest names (`report.json` `files[]` for png, `output` for pdf, `frames.json` `output` for video), since a reused `--out` keeps older files. The HTML stays canonical; never restructure it for an exporter.

Record the outcome in the Step 9 report:

```
Fidelity vs existing UI: PASS | FAIL — tokens / components / layout / flows / embeds / demos matched? If FAIL: what diverged + the fix.
```

If **FAIL**, revise the deck to match the existing UI and re-validate before handoff.

**Re-check after every fix:** any edit made for a fidelity, demo-integrity or Step 8b Demo-Quality failure changes the deck, so re-run the `--profile=review` conformance check on the saved deck before recording the verdicts again — `Conformance (review): PASS` in the Step 9 report is the result of the check on the final deck, never of an earlier version.

### Step 8b: [BLOCKING] Demo-Quality Review (final review todo)

> **[BLOCKING] Final review before the report (the per-journey todos and this gate were created in Step 5).** First confirm the deck **SATISFIES the intent**: every in-scope main user story is presented as a journey (coverage — no main story missing) AND each journey faithfully conveys that story's intended behavior, not merely that slides render. Then run a stakeholder-comprehension pass: *could a PO with no prior context follow each journey end-to-end?* Confirm every demo-flow slide clicks through, narration explains each step in plain language, the "⚠ Simulated" note is present, and the spec-only path degrades to narrated ASCII frames (never an HTML mockup). Record `Demo quality: PASS | FAIL` — FAIL if any main story is unrepresented or misrepresented, regardless of polish.

If **FAIL**, fix the journey slides (re-extract from the §6 journey map / re-embed the flow-scoped mockup), re-run the Step 8 conformance check, and re-review before handoff.

### Step 9: Report to User

After assembly, output:

```
Deck generated: {artifacts-root}/presentations/{YYMMDD}-presentation-{slug}.html
- Artifacts synthesized: {count} ({ideas}/{specs}/{pbis}/{stories}/{mockups}/{design-specs})
- Backlog priority: {ranked | not prioritized} — Scope & backlog slide shows {N} PBIs in ranked order with priority labels
- Demo journeys: {count} ({journey titles})
- Stakeholder sections: {title, how-to-demo, business-context, scope-backlog, behavior-rules, demo-flows, ui-mockups, qc-view, summary}
- Conformance (review): PASS
- Browser behaviors: {notes open/close/Escape, notes readable by keyboard at 125–150% zoom with the deck not moving while the focus is in them, overview focus, keyboard, keyboard scroll-then-advance on an overflowing slide at 200% zoom / narrow width, notes panel visible when opened at narrow width, text and control contrast in both themes after token substitution, print, reduced motion, screen-reader names of the controls, no-JavaScript fallback} — each browser-verified | NOT VERIFIABLE
- Outside assets: declared ({N} mockups) | none
- Design-explore hand-off: none | journey fixes: {each fix — applied | N/A — <reason>}; departures from the picked direction: none | {e.g. web font → system stack}
- Fidelity vs existing UI: PASS | FAIL
- Demo quality: PASS | FAIL

```

When html-export is installed, offer a PDF copy: `node .claude/skills/html-export/scripts/export.cjs --to=pdf <deck.html> --page=1920x1080` (the deck's print styles put one slide per page); fall back to the slides route `--to=pdf <deck.html> --slides=section.deck__slide` when the print route fails (apply the Step 8 exit rule).

## Slide Taxonomy (stakeholder-oriented)

Every slide section must serve the four stakeholder audiences (PO/BA/Dev/QC):

| Section                | Audience  | Content                                                                                  |
| ---------------------- | --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Title / agenda**     | all       | Feature(s) presented, run date, scope                                                    |
| **How to use this deck** | all     | Early guide slide: navigation (Previous/Next, arrow/PageUp/PageDown/Space/`Home`/`End` keys), All slides (overview), Notes and Escape, Tab into the notes to scroll them (the scroll keys then move only the notes), each demo's hotspots and own ▶ Play / ⏮ ⏭ / ↺ Reset controls (inside the mock-up), leaving a demo (click outside it, or press Tab until you leave it), Full screen and Dark theme; the outside-asset viewer notice when declared (`references/deck-template.md` §3b) |
| **Business context**   | PO/BA     | Problem, value, idea→spec narrative, epics/features                                       |
| **Scope & backlog**    | PO/BA/Dev | PBIs (in ranked order, each card showing its priority label + numeric rank from PBI frontmatter / backlog), user stories, acceptance criteria — priority is MANDATORY when PBIs are prioritized |
| **Behavior & rules**   | Dev/QC    | Feature Spec §4 business rules / §5 invariants, §8 test cases                             |
| **Demo flows / user journeys** | all | One interactive MVP demo slide per main user story: embedded interactive mockup scoped to the flow + a narration strip explaining each step ("click X → see Y → move to Z"); spec-only → narrated ASCII frames (`references/deck-template.md` §3b) |
| **UI / mockups**       | all       | Embedded `pbi --mode=mockup` HTML (idea-to-pbi) OR design-spec ASCII + tables (idea-to-spec) OR empty-state |
| **QC view**            | QC/QA     | Test specifications, states matrix, edge cases                                           |
| **Summary / next steps** | all     | Recap, decisions needed, next workflow steps                                             |

## UI Layout

The deck is itself a UI artifact. ASCII of a slide frame:

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  ## Business Context                            │  ← slide title (h2); no top bar
│  • Problem  • Value  • Epics                     │  ← slide body (design-system tokens)
│  ┌──────────────────────────────────────────┐   │
│  │  <iframe srcdoc> embedded mockup / wire   │   │  ← embedded visual (or empty-state)
│  └──────────────────────────────────────────┘   │
├────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Slide 3 of 12: Business Context                │  ← status (live region) = the only counter
│  Previous  Next  All slides  Notes  Full screen │  ← text-labelled controls (+ Dark theme)
└────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Component tiers: common (slide shell, controls, status, notes panel, overview) — domain-shared (mockup/wireframe embed block) — page-app (per-artifact content slides). Keyboard: arrows, PageUp/PageDown, Space, `Home/End`; All slides opens an overview of every slide title; Notes opens the speaker-notes panel beside the slide; theme toggle (light/dark) reusing design-system tokens.

## Edge Cases

| Scenario                                       | Handling                                                                 |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Scope resolves to zero artifacts               | Emit an explicit empty-state slide rather than failing (Step 6 / TC-026) |
| Spec without PBIs (mockup-bearing workflow)    | Ask once (`manual` tier); on a yes, `workflow-spec-to-pbi` sub-agent (Step 2) |
| Spec-only `idea-to-spec`                       | Design-spec visuals only + narrated ASCII-frame step-through; never generate mockups, never invoke `pbi --mode=mockup` (Step 2 / Step 6) |
| Feature with no mockup AND no design-spec      | Empty-state slide ("No prototype or design available") — never blank iframe |
| Demo iframe focused while navigating slides    | Keys inside a demo stay in the demo; click outside it, or press Tab until you leave it, to navigate — the how-to slide says so (Step 6 / `deck-template.md` §3b) |
| Embedded mockup loads a web font or other outside asset | Declare the deck's asset policy + how-to viewer notice (Step 6 outside-asset scan); the deck's own markup still loads nothing |
| Deck fails the `review` conformance check      | Fix the failed checks and re-run; never report the deck ready while it fails (Step 8) |
| Workflow spans midnight (multi-day)            | Glob over plan's created→now range, not just today's `{YYMMDD}` (Step 1) |
| Standalone invocation with no prompt/scope     | ask the user directly which specs/ideas to present (Step 1)                   |

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern                                  | Correct Approach                                                   |
| --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| CDN reveal.js / impress.js                    | The scaffold's vanilla-JS engine, self-contained                  |
| Web-font link in the deck's own markup        | Project or system type; declare the asset policy only for embedded demos that load outside assets |
| Reporting the deck ready on a failing check   | Fix, re-run `--profile=review` until exit 0, then report           |
| Regenerating a mockup that already exists     | Embed the existing `-mockup.html` via `<iframe srcdoc>`           |
| HTML mockups in `idea-to-spec`                | Design-spec ASCII wireframes + tables only (spec-only contract)   |
| Link to external mockup files                 | Inline via `<iframe srcdoc>` — one standalone file                |
| Lorem ipsum / "Item 1, Item 2"               | Real domain entity field names + realistic sample data            |
| Broken/blank iframe for a missing visual      | Explicit empty-state slide                                         |
| Running gap-fill workflow inline              | Run multi-step gap-fill workflows as SUB-AGENTS (context bounded)  |

---

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Extend `pbi --mode=mockup` with `--deck`** (rejected) — it serves one PBI; a synthesis deck has different inputs/audience. Separate ownership preserves single responsibility and the spec-only contract.
2. **CDN reveal.js / impress.js** (rejected) — breaks offline/no-external-deps and adds supply-chain risk; the scaffold's vanilla-JS engine matches `pbi --mode=mockup`'s zero-dependency posture.
3. **Link mockup files** (rejected) — violates the ONE-file mandate; `<iframe srcdoc>` keeps the deck portable when files move.
4. **Chosen:** standalone skill + inline single-file deck + iframe-srcdoc embeds. Larger HTML is acceptable because text gzips and offline portability wins.

## Design Rationale

A synthesis deck differs from a per-PBI mockup in inputs, audience, and altitude, so it owns a separate skill but reuses the mockup engine through `<iframe srcdoc>`. That mechanism satisfies both the ONE-file and existing-mockup contracts. Existing-UI research plus fidelity keeps the deck project-faithful; spec-only and empty-state branches preserve visual output without breaking `idea-to-spec`; sub-agent gap-fill keeps context bounded.

---

## Security Considerations

`<iframe srcdoc>` embeds first-party generated mockup HTML only — no remote content or user-supplied script. Entity-escape `srcdoc` (`&` first, once) to prevent `</iframe>`/`<script>` breakout. Demos run unsandboxed — the demo iframe has no `sandbox` attribute — so mockups keep their own scripts and storage; a mockup runs with the deck's origin, so only first-party mockups are embedded, and the outside assets it loads follow the asset policy (Step 6). The deck is self-contained; outside assets only with the deck's declared asset policy (added automatically when an embedded prototype loads an outside asset), and its own markup outside `srcdoc` loads nothing from a network; artifacts contain no secrets.

## Next Steps

**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION — NO EXCEPTIONS:** After completion, MUST ATTENTION use ask the user directly to present these options; the user decides, even when the task seems simple:

- **"Open the deck"** — open the standalone HTML in a browser to review with stakeholders
- **"$prioritize"** — prioritize the synthesized PBIs in the backlog
- **"$plan"** — start implementation planning
- **"Skip, continue manually"** — user decides

> **[IMPORTANT]** Use task tracking to break ALL work into small tasks BEFORE starting.

> **Evidence Gate:** MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION — every claim, finding, and recommendation requires `file:line` proof or traced evidence with confidence percentage (>80% to act, <80% must verify first).

## Prompt-Enhance Closing Anchors

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** follow declared step order for this skill; NEVER skip, reorder, or merge steps without explicit user approval
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** for every step/sub-skill call: set `in_progress` before execution, set `completed` after execution
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** every skipped step MUST include explicit reason; every completed step MUST include concise evidence
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** if Task tools unavailable, maintain an equivalent step-by-step plan tracker with synchronized statuses

<!-- PROMPT-ENHANCE:STEP-TASK-CLOSING:END -->


<!-- SYNC:design-distinctiveness-gate:reminder -->

- **MUST ATTENTION** apply the design distinctiveness gate (`DD-1`–`DD-8`) to any user-facing visual surface: ground it in the named subject/audience/job and confirm when the brief is silent (`DD-1`) · every choice carries a WHY, token names included (`DD-2`) · write a design plan (colour 4–6 named hex · type families+roles+scale · layout prose+ASCII+alignment · principles) then run the BLOCKING generic test and state what you revised BEFORE coding (`DD-3`) · audit every free axis against the T1–T5 tell catalog — cream+serif+`#D97757`, acid-on-black, broadsheet, the SaaS-card kit, template chrome (ALL-CAPS eyebrows, `A · B · C`, spaced-em-dash labels, `#0B0B0B`, mono data labels, trailing `→`) — a match is a missed decision, never a defect (`DD-4`) · 1–2 clearly distinct families, real scale, <80ch, no single-word headline accent / ALL-CAPS labels / redundant eyebrows (`DD-5`) · numbering only on real sequences; hero = the subject's most characteristic thing, not big-number+gradient (`DD-6`) · one orchestrated motion moment, never per-section entrances plus universal card hovers (`DD-7`) · spend boldness once, critique the BUILT page, remove one accessory (`DD-8`). The brief's stated direction OUTRANKS the tell catalog; project design-system docs OUTRANK these clauses — genuine conflicts go to the user, NEVER resolved silently. Cite findings as `DD-<clause>` + `file:line`. Skip ONLY for surfaces with no user-facing visuals, stated explicitly.

<!-- /SYNC:design-distinctiveness-gate:reminder -->

<!-- SYNC:design-review-checklist:reminder -->

- **MUST ATTENTION** when the change/plan/artifact has an applicable user-facing UI surface, READ `.claude/docs/design-review-checklist.md` and run it: `CL-1` establish context first (platform · user · task · metric · constraints · scope · artifacts — state missing context and its confidence impact) · `CL-2` evidence or nothing, cite a location per finding, NEVER invent a measurement (unmeasurable → `NOT VERIFIABLE`), tag `MEASURED`/`OBSERVED`/`HEURISTIC` · `CL-3` rank `P0`–`P4`, cap at top 10 by severity, NEVER pad, concrete fix on every `P0`/`P1` · `CL-4` sweep §A–§N plus §R over whole surfaces (changed files → affected views, composition reconstructed, render or `ENVIRONMENT-BLOCKED`), including surface load B12–B15, container fit E9–E11, §H by usage, Field Necessity Matrix for input, applying only relevant platform/product sections and the WCAG 2.2 AA web baseline plus any stricter applicable legal/project requirement, or the documented standard for other platforms · `CL-5` short on time → use the §P prompts · `CL-6` report in the §O shape · for source code, assess component ownership, base abstractions, reuse, and duplication using the project's documented taxonomy or observed boundaries. Project design-system docs and ADRs OUTRANK the checklist; report a defect ONCE across `UI-*`/`DD-*`/`CL-*`. For a plan, bind only applicable sections and states to acceptance criteria, and name each UI view's primary task, container, information priority, and creation-vs-deferred inputs; a plan review flags a UI phase that omits them. Skip when the work has no user-facing UI surface, and state why.

<!-- /SYNC:design-review-checklist:reminder -->

## Closing Reminders

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION Goal:** Synthesize every in-scope session idea, Feature Spec, PBI, user story, design-spec, and mockup into ONE project-faithful standalone HTML deck with a vanilla-JS engine and interactive MVP demos for every main journey, so PO/BA/Dev/QC review the feature from one offline file before build.

**Protocols in force (concise digest of the SYNC/shared blocks this skill carries):**

- **Existing-UI Research:** [BLOCKING] inventory existing UI + map connected flows before any visual.

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** emit exactly ONE self-contained HTML deck at `{artifacts-root}/presentations/{YYMMDD}-presentation-{slug}.html` (`{artifacts-root}` = default `team-artifacts`; a `docsRoots.teamArtifacts.path` entry in `docs/project-config.json` overrides the path) — inline CSS/JS, self-contained; outside assets only with the deck's declared asset policy (added automatically when an embedded prototype loads an outside asset); project or system type, NO CDN reveal.js, vanilla-JS slide engine — why: stakeholders open one offline file with no server, no build step.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** [BLOCKING] run `node .claude/skills/presentation-builder/scripts/validate-presentation.cjs <deck.html> --profile=review` before the fidelity gate; exit 0 required — NEVER report the deck ready while it fails; fix and re-check; record browser behaviors as browser-verified or `NOT VERIFIABLE` — why: `presentation-builder` owns the shared deck standard, and a static PASS is not browser proof.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** present every in-scope main user story as an interactive MVP demo slide ("click X → see Y → move to Z") — extract the journeys first (Step 5, one todo per journey), embed the self-driving interactive mockup + a deck narration strip + "⚠ Simulated" note, add a "How to use this deck" guide slide, and sign off with the final Demo-Quality review (Step 8b) — why: a narrated journey answers "how does it work", which is what the user asked for; the deck adds only narration, never a second interactivity engine.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** REUSE existing `-mockup.html` via `<iframe srcdoc="…escaped…">` — never regenerate a mockup that already exists; escaping rule (`&`-first, escape-once-unconditionally) lives in `references/deck-template.md` — why: re-rendering duplicates the mockup engine and risks divergence.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** accept a PBI mockup only when its Releasable Full-Flow gate passes: all required pages/views, navigation edges, common/domain/page components, applicable states, and the visible/persisted business result are demoable; one static/disconnected screen set is FAIL and routes back to `pbi --mode=mockup`.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** spec-only `idea-to-spec` → design-spec ASCII wireframes + inventory/states/tokens tables + a narrated step-through of ASCII frames ONLY; NEVER generate HTML mockups, NEVER invoke `pbi --mode=mockup` — why: full mockups break the spec-only no-code contract.

**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** break work into small todo tasks using task tracking BEFORE starting; add a final review todo to verify quality.
**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** validate next-step decisions with the user by asking the user directly — standalone + no prompt → ask which specs/ideas to present, never silently guess scope.

**Domain rules this skill must not skip:**

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** default scope anchors on `activePlan` and accumulates its FULL artifact set across the plan's created→now date range — NEVER just today's `{YYMMDD}` — why: a multi-day workflow authors specs on day 1 and PBIs on day 2; a single-day glob silently drops day-1 artifacts.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** `workflow-spec-to-pbi` is `manual` tier — ask the user once and run it only on a yes, else report the gap; run multi-step gap-fill workflows as SUB-AGENTS — summary returned, full findings written to `tmp/reports/` per CLAUDE.md "Workflow Step Advancement §3" — why: inline activation pollutes the deck-build context with the full workflow transcript.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** render an explicit empty-state slide when scope resolves to zero artifacts OR a feature has no mockup AND no design-spec — never fail, never a broken/blank iframe — why: stakeholders must always get a coherent deck.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** [BLOCKING] inventory existing UI (Step 4) BEFORE assembling, then run the [BLOCKING] fidelity gate (Step 8, incl. demo integrity — every journey clicks through, no dead controls, narration tech-agnostic) AFTER — record `Fidelity vs existing UI: PASS|FAIL` (tokens / components / layout / flows / embeds / demos) and the final `Demo quality: PASS|FAIL` (Step 8b) — why: a generic-HTML or click-broken deck previews a system that does not exist.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** use REAL domain entity field names + realistic sample data — NEVER Lorem ipsum or "Item 1, Item 2"; keep prose tech-agnostic (business terms, not framework/CSS class names) — why: fake data and tech-coupled prose mislead stakeholders.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** the Scope & backlog slide MUST show PBIs in ranked order with each card's priority label + numeric rank (read from PBI frontmatter / the ranked backlog artifact) whenever the PBIs are prioritized — why: priority is a primary PO/BA decision input; a deck that hides it forces stakeholders back to the raw backlog. Note explicitly if PBIs are not yet prioritized rather than dropping the field.

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** cite `file:line` evidence for every claim/finding (confidence >80% to act, <80% verify first) — NEVER speculate about artifacts, design tokens, or component patterns without reading the source.

**Anti-Rationalization:**

| Evasion                                          | Rebuttal                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "reveal.js is easier than a vanilla engine"      | CDN violates the self-contained contract. Use the scaffold's engine; project or system type.  |
| "The validator is advisory — the deck looks fine" | The `review` profile check is BLOCKING. Fix and re-run until exit 0; never report ready while it fails. |
| "Regenerate the mockup, it's cleaner"            | Embed the existing `-mockup.html` via `<iframe srcdoc>`. Never duplicate the mockup engine.    |
| "Add a quick HTML mockup to the idea-to-spec deck"| Spec-only contract — design-spec ASCII + tables + narrated ASCII frames ONLY. No mockups, no `pbi --mode=mockup`. |
| "A still screenshot of the mockup is enough"     | The user asked for an interactive MVP demo of each main journey — embed the self-driving mockup + a narration strip, don't flatten it to a still. |
| "Re-implement the click-through in the deck"     | The deck adds only narration; the mockup is self-driving (one engine). Embed it, don't duplicate its interactivity. |
| "Glob today's date, it's the same session"       | Multi-day workflows span midnight. Glob the plan's created→now range or day-1 artifacts vanish. |
| "Run the gap-fill workflow inline, it's faster"  | Multi-step workflows run as SUB-AGENTS — summary + `tmp/reports/`. Keeps context bounded.    |
| "No mockup? leave the slide blank"               | Render an explicit empty-state slide. Never a broken/blank iframe.                             |
| "PBI titles are enough on the backlog slide"     | Show each PBI in ranked order with its priority label + rank — priority is a primary PO/BA input; read it from PBI frontmatter / the backlog artifact. |

**[TASK-PLANNING]** Before acting, analyze task scope and systematically break it into small todo tasks and sub-tasks using task tracking.

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION Goal:** Synthesize every in-scope session idea, Feature Spec, PBI, user story, design-spec, and mockup into ONE project-faithful standalone HTML deck with a vanilla-JS engine and interactive MVP demos for every main journey, so PO/BA/Dev/QC review the feature from one offline file before build.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** ONE self-contained HTML (outside assets only with the deck's declared asset policy, added automatically when an embedded prototype loads an outside asset; vanilla-JS engine; speaker notes on every slide; passes `--profile=review` before it is reported ready), one interactive demo-flow slide per main journey (embedded self-driving mockup + narration strip + "⚠ Simulated" note) + a "How to use this deck" guide slide; spec-only → design-spec visuals + narrated ASCII frames (never invoke `pbi --mode=mockup`), empty-state slide never blank iframe.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** plan journeys first (Step 5, one todo each), default scope = active-plan created→now range (not just today), gap-fill via SUB-AGENT, [BLOCKING] existing-UI inventory + fidelity gate (incl. demo integrity) + final Demo-Quality review (Step 8b), real domain data, cite `file:line` (>80% confidence) — NEVER guess.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION Main steps/modes (in order):** (1) resolve scope (`activePlan` created→now; custom prompt widens; standalone/no prompt asks) → (2) gap-fill (ask once, on a yes `workflow-spec-to-pbi` SUB-AGENT; `idea-to-pbi` missing mocks → `pbi --mode=mockup`; `idea-to-spec` skips) → (3) design context → (4) [BLOCKING] UI/flow inventory → (5) artifacts + journeys/todos → (6) one deck, or spec-only ASCII/empty state → (7) save → (8) [BLOCKING] `review`-profile conformance, then fidelity + demo integrity → (8b) [BLOCKING] Demo-Quality → (9) report. NEVER skip blocking gates or journey extraction — why: forgotten branches or gates produce incomplete, ungated decks.
