> Codex compatibility note:
> - Invoke repository skills with `$skill-name` in Codex; this mirrored copy rewrites legacy Claude `/skill-name` references.
> - Host-native execution: Codex runs a skill by loading its `SKILL.md` instructions and executing the required steps with available tools. No separate `Skill` tool is required; a loaded skill is already activated.
> - Source vs execution: prefer the registered `.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` for Codex execution. `.claude/**` remains the canonical authoring source; reading it for a registry or source inspection does not switch this session to Claude Code.
> - Capability check: interpret Claude tool names through the active host before declaring a blocker. Continue when Codex can perform the required operation; stop and ask only when the actual capability is unavailable, naming the step and evidence. Host-native execution is not a protocol deviation and needs no extra approval.
> - Todo tracking mandate: BEFORE executing any workflow or skill step, create/update todo tracking for all steps and keep it synchronized as progress changes.
> - Use ask user question tool to ask user.
> - Ignore Claude-specific mode-switch instructions when they appear.
> - Strict execution contract: when a user explicitly invokes a skill, execute that skill protocol as written.
> - Subagent authorization: when a skill is user-invoked or AI-detected and its protocol requires subagents, that skill activation authorizes use of the required `spawn_agent` subagent(s) for that task.
> - Do not skip, reorder, or merge protocol steps unless the user explicitly approves the deviation first.
> - For workflow skills, steps follow the guided contract in `$start-workflow` (gate steps fixed; other steps may flex with a logged reason); report step-by-step evidence.
> - If a required step/tool cannot run in this environment, stop and ask the user before adapting.
## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Find real defects in the requested diff and, when requested, converge its fixes without losing coverage or quality.

**Summary:** Triage every changed file and write a short plan → create review tasks → check connected behavior and applicable concerns → validate findings → report once or fix and freshly re-review. Choose review depth and delegation from risk and available context.

**Workflow:** Resolve scope → plan/tasks → review → validate → review-only report or fix/re-review → final checks and recap.

**Key Rules:** Review-only is the standalone default; `--fix-loop` enables the shared three-round loop. `--loop-owner=caller` returns a read-only pass to its fixing coordinator. Use the carried `review-policy` protocol for completion and user-approved extensions.

> **Todo first:** create tasks for triage, review, validation, fixes, fresh re-review and final checks before execution; keep one task in progress and attach evidence when completed.

## Scope and plan

Default scope is current working changes: `git status`, `git diff`, `git diff --cached`, and relevant untracked files. Honor staged-only, unstaged-only and named-file requests exactly. Current branch/PR review includes `git diff <base>...HEAD` plus local changes; pin the merge-base before reviewing. Historical commits compare their first parent (empty tree for a root); explicit ranges compare the named endpoints. Do not infer historical PR membership from current branch membership; a merged or squashed PR needs an explicit commit or verified range. Historical assessment is review-only: fixing current files requires an agreed current target, and cannot make an immutable historical diff converge.

Start from metadata and the stated task/plan/goal. Record intent, all target paths, risks, relevant rules, affected callers/tests and how coverage will be checked in `tmp/reports/changes-review-<run>.md`. Before review, read the run's deviation log (`tmp/workflow-runs/<runId>/skips.md`) when present. Decide inline work or authorized reviewers and group related flows as useful; the adaptive planning protocol owns guidance, without fixed file/line limits.

## Review concerns

For every applicable changed behavior, inspect correctness against intent, supported success/error paths, null/empty/boundary states, resource cleanup and async/concurrency concerns. Trace callers and contracts across affected boundaries. Judge responsibility, reuse, naming and maintainability against the project's conventions and actual architecture; absence of a textbook pattern is not a defect.

Check spec/test/code consistency, meaningful test assertions and documentation drift. Treat secrets, authorization, privacy, public contracts, migrations, dependencies, operational behavior, hot paths, UI and AI features as risk signals for relevant deeper review. Skip inapplicable concerns with evidence; do not silently omit required gates.

Route specialist depth only where applicable: architecture, domain-analysis, performance-review, integration-test review, security-audit, production-readiness-review, ui-design review and ai-engineering-review. For current AI surfaces run `node .claude/scripts/ai-signal-scan.cjs --json` (add `--base <base>` for branch/PR scope, or `--files <paths>` for named files). `clean` allows skipping; `unknown` requires source inspection and conservative coverage. Historical assessment inspects the selected historical sides directly; a live scan cannot prove them clean.

When integration tests are in the target or guard changed behavior, run `$integration-test --mode=review --report-only` in review-only mode, or `$integration-test --mode=review --fix-loop --loop-owner=caller` inside the fixing loop. This owner applies all eight test-quality gates; a named parent may own the gate, but deferral never waives it.

Review executable E2E/browser/user-flow changes under `.claude/skills/shared/e2e-quality-protocol.md`; a document merely naming E2E is not a trigger. Invoke `$e2e-test --mode=verify` report-only for applicable executable E2E changes. Run applicable test proof unless `--tests=defer` assigns it to a later named verification step. Required checks that cannot run stay unavailable, never PASS.

## Validation, fixes and re-review

Report each finding with severity, reachable trigger, consequence, `file:line` and confidence. Keep observations separate. Consolidate duplicate causes while retaining every report and conflicting claim. Any surviving finding requires `$why-review --validate-findings <report>` before fixes or handoff. Resolve the configured canonical owner, profile-declared canonical scenario/case identity and executing test assertion/result. Carry behavior-changing findings into both the governing spec and guarding tests; adjudicate intended changes rather than rewriting either side merely to pass.

Review-only returns the validated report without source changes. Fix-loop follows `review-policy`: trace the owning cause, apply authorized fixes, then freshly review the whole updated target and affected interactions. Create an explicit re-review task even for a small fix. Update relevant specs/docs before the final pass so no terminal edit escapes review.

`--defer=<duties>` may assign whole-target rationale, specialists, tests, entities or simplification to a named caller; read [references/caller mode](../workflow-review-changes/references/caller-mode.md) when using it. Every duty needs an owner and evidence. The workflow passes `--fix-loop --loop-owner=caller` so all readers join its loop without concurrent writers.

Read [references/fix-loop.md](references/fix-loop.md) when issuing a full-candidate review receipt. Receipt freshness never grants Git authority.

<!-- PROTOCOL-GUIDES:END -->

<!-- SYNC:whole-diff-correctness:reminder -->

**MUST ATTENTION** Trace the complete changed behavior, including success/error paths and cross-file interactions. Adapt grouping to context, preserve complete coverage and evidence, and verify the settled post-fix target before PASS.

<!-- /SYNC:whole-diff-correctness:reminder -->

<!-- SYNC:domain-entity-change-gate:reminder -->

**MUST ATTENTION** when a changed model uses DDD tactical patterns or an evidenced equivalent, apply the **Domain Entity Change Gate** — `$domain-analysis --mode=review` owns the full A–P checklist; detect paradigm + subdomain fit FIRST, then answer all 6 applicable decisions (classification · invariant ownership + failure signalling · aggregate boundary + concurrency · construction vs reconstitution · events · assertion-backed native test obligation). Use property TCs only under the absent-profile default; a malformed declared `specArtifacts` profile blocks without fallback. When the project does not use this model, record the DDD-specific gate N/A and still protect actual invariants and outcomes through the configured owner. Planning must NAME each applicable decision; plan review treats an unanswered row as a FINDING; change review routes to the owner (Mode A read / Mode B delegate). SKIP under the 3-row duplication guard and record the deferral line. — why: one protocol shared by planner and reviewer is what stops a plan shipping an entity design that review then rejects.

<!-- /SYNC:domain-entity-change-gate:reminder -->

<!-- SYNC:understand-code-first:reminder -->

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** search 3+ existing patterns and read code/conventions BEFORE any modification or explanation. The code graph is optional advice for high-risk blast radius (a hint that may be stale), never a requirement.

<!-- /SYNC:understand-code-first:reminder -->

<!-- SYNC:evidence-based-reasoning:reminder -->

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** cite `file:line` evidence for every claim; never speculate. Confidence >80% to act, <60% = do NOT recommend; "not enough evidence" is valid output.

<!-- /SYNC:evidence-based-reasoning:reminder -->

<!-- SYNC:design-patterns-quality:reminder -->

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** select patterns from project evidence and real needs; keep one owner per rule, justify abstractions by change cost, and grep affected scope for dangling references after extraction, move, or rename.

<!-- /SYNC:design-patterns-quality:reminder -->

<!-- SYNC:complexity-prevention:reminder -->

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** assess change amplification, cognitive load, coupling, leaked detail and invariant ownership from project evidence. Extract only when a real owner or consumer lowers change cost; no universal layer order or numeric threshold.

<!-- /SYNC:complexity-prevention:reminder -->

<!-- SYNC:graph-assisted-investigation:reminder -->

**Optional advice:** the code graph (`.code-graph/graph.db`) can hint at a high-risk blast radius grep misses; it can be stale, so verify by reading files. Never required.

<!-- /SYNC:graph-assisted-investigation:reminder -->

<!-- SYNC:logic-and-intention-review:reminder -->

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** verify WHAT the code does matches WHY it changed, and every changed file serves the stated purpose. Trace happy + error paths. Flag scope creep.

<!-- /SYNC:logic-and-intention-review:reminder -->

<!-- SYNC:bug-detection:reminder -->

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** check null safety, boundary conditions, error handling, resource management for every review.

<!-- /SYNC:bug-detection:reminder -->

<!-- SYNC:test-spec-verification:reminder -->

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** map every changed function/endpoint/code path to a test case. Search for the project's test spec format near changed files. Flag untested paths and coverage gaps; recommend test creation.

<!-- /SYNC:test-spec-verification:reminder -->

<!-- SYNC:integration-test-sync-check:reminder -->

**Review/audit invocations:** follow `SYNC:review-decision-autonomy` for every decision prompt; choose supported recommendations without asking, preserve round-extension approval and actual authority.

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** check changed logic files for matching tests. Surface missing tests via `ask user question tool` — mandatory, not advisory.

<!-- /SYNC:integration-test-sync-check:reminder -->

<!-- SYNC:translation-sync-check:reminder -->

**Review/audit invocations:** follow `SYNC:review-decision-autonomy` for every decision prompt; choose supported recommendations without asking, preserve round-extension approval and actual authority.

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** for multilingual UI text changes, verify translation updates are present or explicitly accepted by the user as risk (`ask user question tool` when missing) before PASS.

<!-- /SYNC:translation-sync-check:reminder -->

<!-- SYNC:cross-stack-impact-trace:reminder -->

**MUST ATTENTION** FIRST review action — note change context + holistically trace full pipeline of main affected area across client↔server seam (BE→FE forward, FE→BE backward). Verify both tiers still agree on route/DTO/field/type/nullability/auth; any mismatch = BREAKING finding. Skip only for single-tier / docs-only changes (state so).

<!-- /SYNC:cross-stack-impact-trace:reminder -->

<!-- SYNC:cross-service-check:reminder -->

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** microservices/event-driven: scan producers, consumers, sagas, contracts in task scope. Per touchpoint: owner · message · consumers · risk (NONE/ADDITIVE/BREAKING). Missing consumer = silent regression.

<!-- /SYNC:cross-service-check:reminder -->

<!-- SYNC:sequential-thinking-protocol:reminder -->

**MUST ATTENTION** use structured reasoning for complex or ambiguous work, implicitly when visible markers would clutter. Verify hypotheses, revise assumptions, and close with confidence, assumptions, open questions and a concrete next action.

<!-- /SYNC:sequential-thinking-protocol:reminder -->

<!-- SYNC:task-tracking-external-report:reminder -->

- **MANDATORY** Bootstrap task tracking before target work; transition one task at a time.
- **MANDATORY** Persist plan/review findings to `tmp/reports/` incrementally and synthesize from disk.

<!-- /SYNC:task-tracking-external-report:reminder -->

<!-- SYNC:end-to-start-debugger-trace:reminder -->

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** debugger trace gate: for non-trivial bug/fix/investigation/review work, start at the observed final output and trace backward through reader -> storage/projection -> writer -> consumer/job -> producer/trigger. Enumerate all feeder paths and hypotheses before fixing; select the authoritative invariant owner from project architecture and retain validation at untrusted boundaries. **BLOCKED until** trace, hypothesis matrix, owning fix layer, and forward convergence proof exist.

<!-- /SYNC:end-to-start-debugger-trace:reminder -->

<!-- SYNC:goal-contract-satisfaction-loop:reminder -->

- **MANDATORY** Resolve the active Goal Contract BEFORE work (active plan `goal.md` → `<plans root>/goals/{YYMMDD-HHmm}-{slug}/goal.md`, plans root default `plans` and overridable via a `docsRoots.plans.path` entry in `docs/project-config.json` → create from current request) and read saved success criteria before editing.
- **MANDATORY** Append iteration evidence after execution; emit a Goal Satisfaction matrix (PASS/FAIL/BLOCKED) before reporting PASS; loop on validated FAIL; escalate repeated no-progress or blockers. NEVER store secrets in goal files.

<!-- /SYNC:goal-contract-satisfaction-loop:reminder -->

<!-- SYNC:systematic-review-batching:reminder -->

**MUST ATTENTION** Triage all files, write a short review plan and create review/validation/fix/re-review tasks first. Choose inline work or authorized specialists from risk, relationships and context headroom; no fixed file/line/byte caps. Persist coverage, reconcile interactions and validate findings before fixes or PASS.

<!-- /SYNC:systematic-review-batching:reminder -->

<!-- SYNC:severity-rubric:reminder -->

- **MANDATORY** Classify every finding Critical/High/Medium/Low by consequence using the affected asset, shipped impact, exposure, reversibility, evidence location, and confidence; Critical/High/MEDIUM remain actionable under the round bar, while LOW is recorded/deferred from round 2 onward.
- **MANDATORY** A finding names a reachable trigger path (caller, input, state or event that reaches the defect) and a consequence; an unreachable concern is an observation, and unsettled reachability is `NOT VERIFIABLE` only when the concern would be MEDIUM or higher (an observation otherwise) — never a speculative LOW.
- **MANDATORY** Keep binary gates separate from severity: a failed test, security must-fix, required artifact, or parity check blocks at every round and is never relabeled LOW.
- **MANDATORY** Score-based skills (sre 0-2, perf two-axis) map onto the same four tiers — no parallel severity vocabulary.

<!-- /SYNC:severity-rubric:reminder -->

<!-- SYNC:category-review-thinking:reminder -->

- **MANDATORY** Derive review categories from file language + directory semantics + change nature; create a sub-task per category.
- **MANDATORY** Derive each category's concerns from first principles with `file:line` evidence — never a fixed checklist.

<!-- /SYNC:category-review-thinking:reminder -->

<!-- SYNC:trade-off-interrogation-gate:reminder -->

**Review/audit invocations:** follow `SYNC:review-decision-autonomy` for every decision prompt; choose supported recommendations without asking, preserve round-extension approval and actual authority.

- **MANDATORY MUST ATTENTION ALWAYS ASK THE 3 TRADE-OFF QUESTIONS** — on the thing under review AND on every recommendation you make: (1) **what does it SACRIFICE?** name the dimensions checked (change cost · complexity · perf · coupling · reversibility · migration · ops load · blast radius · security · testability · delivery time · UX) — "none"/"pure win" is an unfinished analysis; (2) **is it worth it?** gain (with a metric) vs cost, WHO pays, WHEN → emit **WORTH IT / NOT WORTH IT / UNCLEAR**; NOT WORTH IT → withdraw or replace it; (3) **is it MATERIAL enough to confirm with the user?** irreversible/one-way door · cost shifted onto another team/ops/maintainer/user · one quality attribute traded for another · a tier/service/event/library boundary crossed · auth/money/data-integrity/breaking-change/High-or-Medium-risk path · verdict UNCLEAR → **STOP and confirm via `ask user question tool` BEFORE the verdict**.
- **MANDATORY** A MATERIAL trade-off with no user confirmation can NEVER be PASS; never bury one as a Low-severity note, never decide it silently, and never let delivery or convergence pressure authorize a one-way door — an un-walked-back one-way door is the user's call, not the reviewer's.
- **MANDATORY — a context that cannot ask escalates BY HANDOFF, never by silence.** `ask user question tool` reaches only the main interactive agent, so a sub-agent or a terminal/verdict-only mode cannot ask. There the duty is REDIRECTED, not waived: still name the trade-off, still decide materiality, record `confirmed? = NO — cannot ask from this context`, and **state the unconfirmed MATERIAL trade-off in your RETURNED verdict so the CALLER escalates it** (a note only in an on-disk report is not a handoff); never emit an unqualified PASS. If you CAN ask, you MUST ask.

<!-- /SYNC:trade-off-interrogation-gate:reminder -->

<!-- SYNC:design-review-checklist:reminder -->

- **MUST ATTENTION** when the change/plan/artifact has an applicable user-facing UI surface, READ `.claude/docs/design-review-checklist.md` and run it: `CL-1` establish context first (platform · user · task · metric · constraints · scope · artifacts — state missing context and its confidence impact) · `CL-2` evidence or nothing, cite a location per finding, NEVER invent a measurement (unmeasurable → `NOT VERIFIABLE`), tag `MEASURED`/`OBSERVED`/`HEURISTIC` · `CL-3` rank `P0`–`P4`, cap at top 10 by severity, NEVER pad, concrete fix on every `P0`/`P1` · `CL-4` sweep §A–§N plus §R over whole surfaces (changed files → affected views, composition reconstructed, render or `ENVIRONMENT-BLOCKED`), including surface load B12–B15, container fit E9–E11, §H by usage, Field Necessity Matrix for input, applying only relevant platform/product sections and the WCAG 2.2 AA web baseline plus any stricter applicable legal/project requirement, or the documented standard for other platforms · `CL-5` short on time → use the §P prompts · `CL-6` report in the §O shape · for source code, assess component ownership, base abstractions, reuse, and duplication using the project's documented taxonomy or observed boundaries. Project design-system docs and ADRs OUTRANK the checklist; report a defect ONCE across `UI-*`/`DD-*`/`CL-*`. For a plan, bind only applicable sections and states to acceptance criteria, and name each UI view's primary task, container, information priority, and creation-vs-deferred inputs; a plan review flags a UI phase that omits them. Skip when the work has no user-facing UI surface, and state why.

<!-- /SYNC:design-review-checklist:reminder -->

<!-- SYNC:review-principle-awareness:reminder -->

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** Every review first checks the change context and routes only applicable principles to their detailed protocols: scale-ready foundation, test intent in the project's native format (GWT is one option), AI-agent-as-user access, and UI/component design when relevant. Record evidence-backed apply/adapt/defer/N/A/block/unverified status with owner and next step; do not invent unrelated findings or expand scope.

<!-- /SYNC:review-principle-awareness:reminder -->

<!-- SYNC:measured-capacity-engineering:reminder -->

**MUST ATTENTION** capacity work: model demand/SLO and distinguish sessions from RPS/in-flight work; disclose load model and offered vs achieved demand; reduce measured work at a safe owner; preserve cache authorization/freshness/bounds; prove cold-state, overload recovery and justified headroom before scaling. Static review returns a verification plan, not invented throughput. Retain the hosting skill's scores, gates and authority.

<!-- /SYNC:measured-capacity-engineering:reminder -->

<!-- SYNC:review-decision-autonomy:reminder -->

**MUST ATTENTION** Decide supported review choices and recommendations, record the rationale, and finish without routine user questions. Keep round-limit extension, indispensable facts and actual action authority; preserve source coverage, validation, tests, read-only boundaries and budgets. Review decisions do not accept open risks or make a failed gate pass.

<!-- /SYNC:review-decision-autonomy:reminder -->

<!-- SYNC:core-engineering-principles:reminder -->

**MUST ATTENTION** Core Engineering Principles — every plan, implementation and review must be **Easy to change** (reuse first, one owner per rule, interfaces/adapters at volatile boundaries, no speculative abstraction) · **Easy to scale** (extend by addition, bounded growth, explicit boundaries, sized to the project's real profile) · **Easy to maintain** (intent-named tests that fail when the rule breaks across happy/error/edge paths; harness green locally and in CI). Before done: next change → how many edit sites? 10× → what breaks? which test goes red?

<!-- /SYNC:core-engineering-principles:reminder -->

<!-- SYNC:review-policy:reminder -->

**MUST ATTENTION** Triage all targets, plan and create review/validation/fix/fresh re-review tasks first. Review-only reports without edits; fix-loop freshly reviews every repair under one fixing owner. Default cap three rounds: disclose deferred LOWs, ask and wait before a bounded extension for MEDIUM+ or failed required checks. Preserve scope, coverage and actual operation authority.

<!-- /SYNC:review-policy:reminder -->

## Closing Reminders

**Goal:** Find real diff defects and converge authorized fixes with complete coverage.

**Main steps:** scope → triage/plan/tasks → connected review → findings validation → report or fix/fresh re-review → final checks.

Preserve exact scope, evidence and applicable gates. Default review-only; fix-loop has three rounds, accepts deferred LOWs and asks about bounded extension for remaining MEDIUM+ or failed checks. Never accept stale pre-fix evidence.
