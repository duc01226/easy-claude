## Codex Project-Reference Loading (Hook-Independent)

Claude and Codex use static project-reference loading as the authority; hooks may accelerate discovery but never replace the explicit read.
When coding, planning, debugging, testing, or reviewing, open project docs explicitly using this routing.

**Always read:**
- `docs/project-config.json` (project-specific paths, commands, modules, and workflow/test settings)
- `docs/project-reference/docs-index-reference.md` (routes to the full `docs/project-reference/*` catalog)
- `docs/project-reference/lessons.md` (always-on guardrails and anti-patterns)

**Missing/stale context route:** If `docs/project-config.json`, the docs index, `lessons.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, or any task-required reference doc is missing or stale, auto-run `$project-init` or the narrow setup route (`$project-config`, `$docs-init`, `$scan-all`, `$scan --target=<key>`, `$ai-context-refresh`) before ordinary project-specific work. A full `$sync-codex` run preflights `CLAUDE.md`; a completed `$ai-context-refresh` run may invoke the standalone runner with `--skip=claude-md` after final source edits. Markerless roots need AI smart-merge unless `portability.requireUniversalGuides: false` is explicit.

**Situation-based docs** (pick by the phase you are about to enter — plan/investigate, edit, test, spec/doc, review — and read only docs the project selects in `referenceDocs` that exist):
- Planning, investigation, or design: `project-structure-reference.md`, `domain-entities-reference.md`, plus the docs below for every file type the plan touches
- Editing or writing code: `code-review-rules.md` plus the backend or frontend docs below for the file type
- Project structure/architecture/tech-stack/deployment/setup (any layer — backend, frontend, or infra): `project-structure-reference.md`
- Backend/CQRS/API/domain/entity changes: `backend-patterns-reference.md`, `domain-entities-reference.md`
- Frontend/UI/styling/design-system: `frontend-patterns-reference.md`, `scss-styling-guide.md` (or the configured styling reference), `design-system/README.md`
- Spec authoring, `docs/specs/` pathing, or TC format: `feature-spec-reference.md`, `spec-system-reference.md`, `spec-principles.md`
- Behavior/public-contract changes or spec-test-code sync: `workflow-spec-test-code-cycle-reference.md` plus the spec docs above
- Derived spec indexes/ERDs/reimplementation guides: `spec-system-reference.md` and source Feature Specs under `docs/specs/`
- Integration test implementation/review: `integration-test-reference.md`
- E2E test implementation/review: `e2e-test-reference.md`
- Test-data seeders: `seed-test-data-reference.md`
- Code review/audit work: `code-review-rules.md` plus the docs above for every file type under review
- Per-file conventions (`contextGroups[]`): before editing an unfamiliar path class, run `node .claude/hooks/lib/file-conventions.cjs --lookup <path>`

**Dedup:** a doc counts as loaded only when your own read returned its full content to this context after the last compaction and within roughly the last 200K tokens, and it has not changed since — cite it `(loaded)` instead of re-reading. A hook reminder, a summary, or a prior mention never counts; a delegated sub-agent starts empty, so name the resolved doc paths in its brief.

Never read all docs blindly: route from `docs-index-reference.md` and open only what the task needs.

> **[TOP REMINDER — WHY-REVIEW FINDINGS-VALIDATION GATE IS NON-NEGOTIABLE]**
>
> If this review produces **ANY** finding (Critical / High / Medium / Low) in standalone mode, you **MUST invoke the `$why-review` skill** through the skill invocation with `--validate-findings <report-path>` **before** any fix, docs-update, commit, or handoff. An actual skill call is the ONLY way to pass this gate — re-reading the cited `file:line`s yourself, "self-validating," or any inline/manual substitute does **NOT** count. In `--report-only` mode (including step 1 of `$workflow-review-changes`) stop after the report — the caller owns validation and fixing.

## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Review any change — one line or thousands of files, code or docs/config/infra — find real defects, missing updates, stale docs and drift with `file:line` evidence, validate every finding, fix the validated blocking ones at their owning layer, and re-review until the round bar clears. Spend depth where the risk is, not where the file count is.

**Summary:**

- **Triage first (Phase 0):** size band, change kinds, risk and blast radius decide which dimensions run, how deep, and how you orchestrate them. Write the **Review Plan** into the report before reviewing.
- **You orchestrate:** inline vs sub-agents, one wave vs batches, which specialist skills to escalate to (`--report-only`) — optimize for speed and cost at equal quality. The required gates below never flex.
- **Memory:** one task per selected dimension/batch and per required gate; ONE living report at `tmp/reports/changes-review-{date}-{slug}.md`, written first and appended per file/batch/phase — re-read it and the current task list after any compaction.
- **Loop (standalone):** Phase 6 validate (`$why-review --validate-findings`, an actual skill call) → Phase 7 SELF-FIX each validated finding that blocks the current round → full re-review → Phase 7.5 holistic full-mode `$why-review` when fixes landed → Phase 8 `$docs-update`. Round 1 needs zero findings; from round 2 only CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM block, LOWs are deferred.
- **Modes:** standalone (default) · `--report-only` (Phases 0–5 only; the caller validates and fixes — auto-selected as step 1 of `$workflow-review-changes`; any other caller passes the flag explicitly — a nested call without it runs standalone and validates and fixes its own findings) · `--fix-loop` (below).
- **Optional `--fix-loop` mode (standalone-only) DECOUPLES find from fix.** Each round runs the default review pass INLINE report-only (Phase 0 → Phase 5, fresh task list, stop before Phase 6), then `$why-review --validate-findings` → `$fix` on validated blocking findings → a FRESH full re-review of the changed diff, under a Goal Contract and bound convergence loop (optional `/goal`). Exit bar, round cap 2 (+1 extension on an open round-2 CRITICAL/HIGH), uncapped failing tests, no-shrink/increasing-blocker escalation, and a terminal Phase 8 `$docs-update` all apply. No flag → default behavior unchanged. Full protocol in `references/fix-loop.md` — read it FIRST when the flag is present (BLOCKING).

**Workflow:**

Phase -1 bind loop (standalone) → Phase 0 triage + Review Plan → Phase 0.7 dimension review (inline or parallel sub-agents) ∥ Phase 0.8 whole-target rationale pass → Phase 3.5–3.9 conditional gates (simplification opportunities, test coverage, entities, E2E) → Phase 4 consolidate + Dual-Feedback Ledger → Phase 5 docs triage → Phase 6 validate → Phase 7 fix + full re-review → Phase 7.5 holistic re-review → Phase 8 `$docs-update`.

**Key Rules:**

- MUST ATTENTION read the run's deviation log (`tmp/workflow-runs/<runId>/skips.md`) when present and treat each skipped, merged, simplified or reordered step as a review input.
- Every finding cites `file:line`, consequence, severity (`SYNC:severity-rubric`) and confidence; speculation is not a finding. Grep 3+ existing examples before flagging a convention violation — codebase convention wins over textbook rules.
- A triage-conditional phase that does not apply completes with a one-line `NOT-APPLICABLE — <evidence>` record; the required gates never do.

## Review Scope

Target: current working-tree changes by default (`git status`, `git diff`, `git diff --cached`); an explicit branch diff (`git diff <base>...<head>`) or commit range (`git diff <base>..<head>`) when the user asks for one.

## First Principle — Easy to Change

> **Success metric: _future change cost_.** DRY, SRP, abstraction, design patterns, naming, layering, tests — all serve one goal: **make the next change cheaper**.

Ask of every change: **does this make the next change cheaper or more expensive?** Reject "best practices" that raise change cost (premature abstraction, speculative generality, leaky indirection, ceremony without payoff); name the real enemies in findings — **coupling, hidden state, duplicated knowledge, unclear intent, irreversible decisions exposed too early**. Apply this lens before any checklist below; pure docs-only changes skip it except for executable examples.

## Core Principles (ENFORCE ALL)

**YAGNI · KISS · DRY** (3+ similar patterns → flag extraction) · **Clean Code** (names reveal intent, one job per function) · **Follow Convention** (grep 3+ examples first) · **No Flaws** (trace happy + error paths, boundaries, null/empty) · **Proof Required** (`file:line` or it is not a finding) · **Doc Staleness** (cross-check changed files against their docs, specs and tests).

## Phase -1: Bind the Review Loop (FIRST ACTION — standalone-only)

- **Run** in standalone invocation: bind the review loop as a standing protocol obligation you self-drive, plus the `/goal` command as an accelerator WHEN available — review the full diff → run `$why-review --validate-findings` on every finding → SELF-FIX each validated finding that blocks the current round → re-review the WHOLE updated diff → loop until one complete pass clears that round's bar (round 1: zero findings; round 2: zero CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM, a LOW-only round ENDS the loop with the LOWs recorded as deferred) → Phase 7.5 when fixes landed, fixing only findings that block the current round and re-running until that bar is clear → Phase 8 `$docs-update`. If `/goal` is unavailable, record one line and continue under the protocol loop; never fake a gate.
- **SKIP** in `--report-only` mode and when invoked as step 1 of `$workflow-review-changes` (the caller owns the loop). Record: `Phase -1 deferred to the caller's review loop.`
- **SKIP** when `--fix-loop` is set — Fix-Loop Step 0b owns the single convergence binding and every round's review pass is report-only. Record: `Phase -1 deferred to --fix-loop Step 0b.`

## Phase 0: Triage + Review Plan (FIRST REVIEW ACTION)

1. **Collect the diff and its intent** from the review scope; list changed files with added/removed line counts, and read the stated intent (task, PBI, plan, Goal Contract, commit messages). When a plan or goal governs the change, check plan compliance — missing or extra scope versus the plan is a finding.
2. **Blast radius** — when `.code-graph/graph.db` exists run `$graph-blast-radius` (or `python .claude/scripts/code_graph blast-radius --json`) and `trace <file> --direction downstream` on the highest-impact files; record impacted files, untested dependents and risk order, and prioritize file review order, highest-impact files first. Without a graph, record `graph unavailable` and use grep for callers. When the diff crosses a boundary (frontend↔backend, service↔service, event producer↔consumer, shared contract), trace it end to end per `SYNC:cross-stack-impact-trace` and `SYNC:cross-service-check` — every consumer of a changed contract is in scope.
3. **Classify** the target:

| Axis | Values | Decides |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Size band** | XS 1–3 files / ≤100 changed lines · S ≤15 · M ≤60 · L ≤300 · XL >300 | orchestration (see Scale Strategy) |
| **Change kinds** | docs-only · tooling/config · test-only · behavior · public contract/API · data/schema/migration · dependency upgrade · bus/event · security-sensitive · UI · infra/CI · cross-module | which dimensions and risk lenses run |
| **Risk** | irreversible · data integrity · security/authority · money/PII · wide blast radius · ambiguous intent | depth — escalate a dimension to its specialist skill whenever risk is present, whatever the size |
| **Mechanical churn** | generated files, lockfiles, pure renames/moves, formatting | verified by pattern (spot-check + grep for residue), recorded in the coverage ledger, not reviewed line by line |

4. **Write the Review Plan** as the report skeleton: triage result, selected dimensions (with the evidence that triggered each), dimensions ruled out (with evidence), orchestration and batches, and a **coverage ledger** listing every changed file → the dimension/batch that owns it. Create one task per selected dimension/batch and one per required gate (Phases 6–8, standalone).

## Phase 0.7: Dimension Review — What to Review

**Always-on core (every diff, cheap):** logic matches stated intent (`SYNC:logic-and-intention-review`) · bug detection (`SYNC:bug-detection`) · readability and change cost · convention fit · secrets/debug artifacts/sensitive files never staged · doc staleness · test pairing (`SYNC:integration-test-sync-check`) · architecture boundaries (read `architectureRules.layerBoundaries` from `docs/project-config.json`; an import that breaches `cannotImportFrom` is a BLOCKING Critical).

**Triggered dimensions** — run when the triage evidences the trigger; escalate to the specialist skill (always with `--report-only`, so it validates its own findings and never edits) when the risk is material or the dimension spans many files:

| Trigger (evidence) | Inline lens | Escalate to |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Behavior-bearing code | spec drift adjudication, test coverage | `$integration-test-review` (Phase 3.7) |
| Auth, permissions, secrets, input handling, external data, dependencies, PII/money | enforcement on every path, negative tests, no secrets in diff | `$security-review --report-only` |
| Data access, loops over data, hot paths, caching, concurrency, render-heavy UI | N+1, unbounded queries, paging, allocation | `$performance-review --report-only` |
| Cross-module change, new module/layer, public contract or dependency-direction change | layering, coupling, ADRs, backward compatibility of every caller | `$architecture-review --report-only` |
| Domain entity / value-object / aggregate files | invariants, encapsulation (`SYNC:domain-entity-change-gate`) | `$domain-entities-review --report-only` (Phase 3.8) |
| Deployable service, API, job, migration, config, operational surface | rollback, idempotency, config in every environment, fail-fast | `$production-readiness-review --report-only` |
| Frontend/UI files (project frontend patterns) | this skill owns the UI dimension | `$ui-review --report-only` |
| DB migration · dependency upgrade · bus/event · API contract · config/env · infra | rollback + volume · semver + advisories · idempotency + retry + poison message · additive vs breaking · all environments · env parity | the matching specialist when material |
| Specs, feature docs, PBIs, test specs in the diff | M1–M7 code-to-spec drift gate (`shared/sdd-artifact-contract.md`), M7 demo test on every added business case | `$spec` audit when broad |
| Bugfix / regression / stale output | End→Start debugger trace gate (`SYNC:end-to-start-debugger-trace`) | `$debug-investigate` when untraced |
| Change implements a documented spec/PBI | spec-compliance pre-pass (`spec-compliance-reviewer`) BEFORE code-quality review | — |
| Multilingual UI text | translation sync (`SYNC:translation-sync-check`) — missing locale updates surface by asking the user directly | — |

Derive categories from the repository's actual structure (`SYNC:category-review-thinking`), not a fixed grid; the table is a floor, not a ceiling. Inside `$workflow-review-changes`, do not escalate to a specialist the parent already runs — record the dimension as owned by the parent's specialist wave and keep only the inline lens.

**Conditional E2E/browser/user-flow trigger** — apply `.claude/skills/shared/e2e-quality-protocol.md` only for changed executable E2E specs, browser config, fixtures, page/component objects, recordings, or source that alters an exercised user journey (a doc that merely mentions E2E is not a trigger). On positive evidence, Phase 3.9 records the trigger paths and must Invoke `$e2e-test-verify` report-only over the fixed E2E scope (never `--fix-loop`); with no trigger record `E2E quality gate: NOT-APPLICABLE — no executable E2E/browser/user-flow surface in the diff`; a positive trigger that cannot run stays `ENVIRONMENT-BLOCKED`.

## Scale Strategy — How to Orchestrate (your choice)

| Band | Recommended shape |
| --- | --- |
| **XS / S** | Review inline in one pass; escalate only a risk-flagged dimension to its specialist. No batching. |
| **M** | One parallel wave: one sub-agent per selected dimension or category (spawned in ONE message), plus the Phase 0.8 pass; you consolidate. |
| **L** | Systematic batching (`SYNC:systematic-review-batching`): size-capped batches per module/category (≤8 files or ≤2000 diff lines each), one report section per batch, then a cross-batch synthesis pass for interactions the batches cannot see. |
| **XL** | As L, plus: review in risk order from the blast radius; batch mechanical churn by pattern; checkpoint the coverage ledger after every wave; re-read the report and the current task list before each new wave. Never sample silently — any file not reviewed line by line is listed with the reason. |

Sub-agent briefs carry the triage, their slice of the coverage ledger, any finding in their scope labelled as an UNVALIDATED hint, the instruction to write their report section FIRST and append per file, and the protocols per `SYNC:review-protocol-injection`. Integrate sub-agent findings RAW — never filter, soften or override them. Parallelize only independent read-only work; a spec-compliance pre-pass returns before the wave it precedes.

## Phase 0.8: Whole-Target Rationale Pass (standalone)

Run `$why-review` in FULL mode over the whole review target combined with the current changes, in parallel with the Phase 0.7 wave (a sub-agent for M and larger; inline for XS/S). It catches whole-package issues scoped reviewers miss — foreclosed alternatives, assumptions that only break when files are read together. Brief it read-only: never `--fix-loop`, and its `$integration-test-review` linkage is deferred to Phase 3.7, which owns the coverage gate (record `Linkage deferred to changes-review Phase 3.7 / parent workflow step.`). Its findings merge into Phase 4. Skip in `--report-only` mode when the caller runs its own whole-target pass (step 2 of `$workflow-review-changes`), recording `Phase 0.8 deferred to the caller's whole-target review.`

## Phases 3.5–3.9: Conditional Gates

- **Phase 3.5 — simplification opportunities** (code changed): `$code-simplifier --report-only` over the changed code; its proposals are findings for the same validation/fix loop, never applied here.
- **Phase 3.7 — test coverage** (behavior-bearing code changed): `$integration-test-review --report-only` over the full diff; Gate 7 maps every behavior change to its profile-declared canonical scenario/case and a covering executing test and assertion/result (integration-first; unit fallback needs justification). GAP / SPEC-GAP results are findings. Inside `$workflow-review-changes` the parent's dedicated step owns it — record `Phase 3.7 deferred to parent workflow $integration-test-review step.`
- **Phase 3.8 — domain entities** (entity files changed): apply the `SYNC:domain-entity-change-gate` lenses inline, or delegate to `$domain-entities-review --report-only` when 3+ entity files or aggregate invariants change. Inside `$workflow-review-changes` its dedicated step owns it.
- **Phase 3.9 — E2E quality** (positive E2E trigger only): report-only `$e2e-test-verify`, per the trigger rule above.
- **Fresh-context gate** (M and larger, zero findings so far): one zero-memory sub-agent re-reads the diff to catch what an anchored reviewer misses; it may only ADD findings (`SYNC:fresh-context-review`).

## Phase 4: Consolidate + Spec Drift + Dual-Feedback Ledger

1. Merge every dimension, batch, specialist and Phase 0.8 finding into the report by severity; note reviewer conflicts; confirm the coverage ledger has no unreviewed file.
2. **Spec Drift Adjudication** (every behavior-changing file, `SYNC:spec-drift-adjudication`): compare the change with its configured canonical owner and classify **CODE-WRONG** (BLOCKING — fix code/test), **SPEC-STALE** (intended change; reconcile the owner, its profile-declared scenario/case and mapped tests), **SPEC-SILENT** (code enforces an unstated invariant; enrich the owner and prove a guarding test), or **AMBIGUOUS** (ask the user directly before editing either side). Green tests never normalize drift.
3. **Dual-Feedback Ledger** — one row per behavior-changing finding with a Spec-feedback cell and a Test-feedback cell; a blank or bare `N/A` on either axis is a FAIL (every N/A carries its reason). The strict default profile expresses these as §3/§4 requirements and §8 TCs.
4. **Goal Satisfaction** — when an active Goal Contract exists (`SYNC:goal-contract-satisfaction-loop`), emit the Goal Satisfaction matrix; a required criterion at FAIL is a finding.

## Phase 5: Docs Triage

Flag every doc, spec or test artifact the change makes stale (section + what changed) as a finding. Do not edit docs here — Phase 7 fixes validated doc findings and Phase 8 sweeps the rest.

**`--report-only` ends here:** return the report path, findings by severity, the coverage ledger summary, spec-drift verdicts and any unconfirmed trade-off. Inside `$workflow-review-changes` hand the report to the parent's validation and fix steps.

## Phase 6: Why-Review Findings Validation (standalone; REQUIRED before any fix)

**Trigger:** ANY finding of any severity — the only skip is a literally empty finding set. Invoke `$why-review --validate-findings <report-path>` through the skill invocation (terminal mode, same session). CLEAN → record `## Why-Review Validation` and continue. HAS ISSUES → reconcile the report (revise severities, remove false positives, add surfaced findings, record `## Why-Review Validation Notes`) and re-validate the updated report — at most 1 re-do round; still not clean → record `## Why-Review Validation — Unresolved` and escalate by asking the user directly. Findings a `--report-only` specialist already validated are carried as validated, not re-validated; `$code-simplifier --report-only` proposals are not self-validated and go through this gate.

## Phase 7: Recursive Auto-Fix + Full Re-Review Loop

**Trigger:** validated findings that block the current round (round 1: any severity; round 2+: CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM). Round-2 LOW-only findings are recorded and deferred, not fixed — list them under `## Deferred LOW Findings (severity floor, round ≥2)`.

1. SELF-FIX each validated finding that blocks the current round at its owning layer — inline for a handful of local fixes, `$fix --target=review <report>` for many or cross-module ones (called from this phase it is a reviewer-owned fix: no approval prompt and no nested `$changes-review` — this loop re-reviews); a defect whose owning cause the report does not trace gets `$debug-investigate` first; a finding the fixer believes is wrong is logged `REJECTED` with its new evidence and re-validated via `$why-review --validate-findings` before it counts as closed. Behavior-changing fixes add or update the guarding test; validated stale docs are fixed at the canonical artifact.
2. Verify the fix set (affected tests, lint, spec/doc sync, config checks) and append `## Fix Cycle {N}` to the report: findings fixed, files changed, verification commands and results.
3. **Re-review the WHOLE current diff** (original changes + fixes) from Phase 0 with a fresh task list — re-read every changed file; the prior report is history, never truth. Re-triage: the fix may change the size band or add a change kind.
4. Repeat until one complete pass clears the round bar.

**Stop conditions:** the same validated finding repeats for 2 full review invocations with no progress → ask the user; a fix needs product/owner input → record the blocker and ask; a required tool or sub-skill is unavailable → ask before adapting. NEVER hand validated blocking findings back as "recommendations" in standalone mode, and never mark the review clean after a fix without the full re-review. Inside `$workflow-review-changes` or `--report-only`, the caller owns fixing and re-review.

## Phase 7.5: Holistic Full-Mode Why-Review (standalone; when fixes landed)

Once the Phase 7 loop converges and any fix landed, invoke `$why-review` in FULL mode (never `--validate-findings`) over the WHOLE review target combined with every fix as one artifact — the post-fix state Phase 0.8 never saw. Keep fixing only findings that block the current round and re-running until that bar is clear; round-2 LOW-only findings are recorded and deferred, not fixed. When no fix landed, record `Phase 7.5: not needed — no fix landed; Phase 0.8 reviewed this exact state.` Inside `$workflow-review-changes` its post-fix `why-review` step owns this.

## Phase 8: Final Docs-Update (standalone; ALWAYS once the loop converges)

Invoke `$docs-update` over the full changeset (diff + fixes). Before it, apply SPEC-STALE and SPEC-SILENT verdicts to the configured canonical owner and its profile-declared scenario/case with the mapped executing test (the strict default profile uses `$spec [update]` + `$spec [mode=tests]`). Record the result under `## Phase 8 Docs-Update`. A spec-content edit here (a new rule or scenario/case) triggers exactly one bounded re-review of the affected package; prose-only edits do not. Inside `$workflow-review-changes` the parent's `$docs-update` step owns this.

## Output Format

The report (`tmp/reports/changes-review-{date}-{slug}.md`) holds, in order: Review Plan (triage, selected/ruled-out dimensions, orchestration) · coverage ledger · findings by severity (`file:line`, consequence, confidence, dimension) · Spec Drift verdicts · Dual-Feedback Ledger · Goal Satisfaction matrix (when a Goal Contract exists) · `## Why-Review Validation` · `## Fix Cycle {N}` blocks · `## Deferred LOW Findings (severity floor, round ≥2)` · Phase 7.5 / Phase 8 records · verdict: **PASS at the current round bar** or **ISSUES FOUND**.

## Recommended Skills

| Skill | When | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$graph-blast-radius`, `$graph-trace` | `.code-graph/graph.db` exists | impact and risk order |
| `$security-review`, `$performance-review`, `$architecture-review`, `$domain-entities-review`, `$production-readiness-review`, `$ui-review` — all `--report-only` | triggered dimension with material risk | specialist depth without a second fixer |
| `$integration-test-review --report-only` | behavior-bearing code | coverage map + assertion quality |
| `$code-simplifier --report-only` | code changed | clarity/maintainability opportunities |
| `$e2e-test-verify` (report-only) | positive E2E trigger | E2E quality gate |
| `$why-review` (FULL / `--validate-findings`) | Phase 0.8 / 6 / 7.5 | rationale pass, validation, post-fix holistic pass |
| `$fix --target=review`, `$debug-investigate` | Phase 7 | owning-layer fixes, untraced defects |
| `$docs-update`, `$spec` | Phase 8 | docs and canonical specs in sync |
| `$workflow-review-changes` | risky, large or pre-merge work that needs guaranteed specialist depth and a runtime experience check | the orchestrated version of this loop |

## AI Agent Integrity Gate

Before reporting done: grep every removed or renamed name across ALL file types (zero dangling references); ask WHY before changing an existing value; verify ALL affected outputs (one green run ≠ all green); re-read files after any compaction.

## `--fix-loop` Mode — Read `references/fix-loop.md` First (BLOCKING)

**Trigger:** `$changes-review --fix-loop [scope]`. Optional; standalone-only. When the flag is present, read `references/fix-loop.md` in full FIRST (BLOCKING) — before Phase -1 and before any review work. It holds the whole mode: Fix-Loop Steps 0–3, the ordered convergence and escalation gate, the terminal docs-update and the review receipt. Without the flag, skip it: every phase above runs exactly as documented. In `--report-only` mode or as step 1 of `$workflow-review-changes`, the caller wins — ignore the flag, do not read the reference, and record `--fix-loop ignored — the caller owns the loop`.

<!-- SYNC:review-policy -->

> **Executable review policy — one predicate, one durable transition model.** Review skills and their tooling MUST use the canonical helper `.claude/scripts/lib/review-policy.cjs` (policy version 4) for round eligibility. The helper's `blockingFindings(round, findings, hardGates)` predicate returns every validated finding in round 1, and only CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM findings from round 2 onward; `NOT VERIFIABLE` is a separate unresolved-evidence state that remains blocking at every round. Failed binary gates are synthetic CRITICAL blocking findings at every round; record a test-green gate with `kind: 'test'` and every other gate with `kind: 'binary'` (the default). `evaluateRound` retains floor-round LOWs in `deferredLow`, never treats a LOW-only round as blocked after the floor applies, reports `extensionGranted` plus an `ESCALATE` status when the review budget is spent with review blockers open, and reports `failingTestGates` / `testLoopContinues` when failing test gates keep the round open. Severity is assigned before the predicate and never changed to obtain a PASS.

> **Round and minimum rules.** `MAX_ROUNDS` (the base budget) is 2 and `HARD_MAX_ROUNDS` is 3; both are ceilings, never targets. Round 3 is an EXTENSION, not part of the default budget: the helper grants it only when the recorded round-2 evaluation still has a validated CRITICAL or HIGH review blocker — a finding, or a failed non-test binary gate carried as synthetic CRITICAL — (`extensionGranted`), grants it at most once per run, and rejects any attempt to reach round 3 without that evidence, except the failing-test continuation below, when round 2's only blockers are failing test gates. **Failing test gates are outside the review budget:** they never earn the extension and never escalate, so while failing `kind: 'test'` gates are the ONLY blockers the helper keeps the run in `CONTINUE` and accepts the next round — past round 3 if needed — until the tests pass. A review blocker past the budget still escalates, and a round with no failing test gate never re-opens the run past its budget. A round-2 evaluation whose blockers are only MEDIUM or `NOT VERIFIABLE` ends the budget and escalates. A clean review ends once `round >= minRounds`; the default minimum is 1 and an explicit `minRounds` may not exceed the base budget of 2 — the extension is earned by evidence, never declared up front. The declaration is persisted and cannot be inferred from a round counter. A failing test-green, security-must-fix, required-artifact, or other binary gate is never waived by the severity floor.
>
> **Durable run record.** A review run MUST identify `runId`, target fingerprint, policy version, target revision, minimum/maximum rounds, completed rounds, full findings/gate evidence, interruption/resume metadata, and acceptance. Use the atomic, lock-serialized transitions in `review-policy.cjs`: `start`, `record`, `accept`, `interrupt`, `resume`, `invalidate`, and `check`. Repeating an identical completed round is idempotent and MUST NOT consume budget twice. A changed target fingerprint invalidates prior evidence and acceptance but MUST preserve the bounded round budget; stale evidence cannot be accepted. A policy-version change (including the round-2 LOW floor and the conditional round-3 extension) invalidates old records; start a new run rather than interpreting old evidence under new semantics. Interrupted/resumed runs retain completed rounds and findings. The record is bookkeeping, not consent, native permission, or proof that a host actually performed the review.
>
> **CLI boundary.** The helper CLI accepts JSON on stdin and uses its own real clock; a supplied `now` is rejected. State directories must be absolute, non-root real directories, records are size-bounded, and malformed/locked state fails closed for the transition. Full reports remain on disk; an inline result envelope is only a transport summary. Any new review policy consumer must add a semantic fixture, boundary counter-cases, a seeded mutant, and a report with the target fingerprint and command exit status.

> **Cross-Stack Impact Trace** — FIRST review action: comprehend change holistically, THEN judge files. Every reviewed diff: note change context, trace full pipeline of main affected area end-to-end across client↔server seam, so a change on one tier can never silently break the other. (Distinct from `SYNC:cross-service-check`, which owns service-to-service / event boundary — this owns client↔server tier seam inside one app; pair both for full-pipeline coverage.)
>
> 1. **Comprehend context FIRST** — before file-by-file review, write short **Change Context** note: what changed, intent (why), originating tier (frontend / backend / shared / infra), main affected feature/flow. Do before flagging anything.
> 2. **Identify cross-stack seam(s)** — for main affected area, locate contract seam(s) between client and server: API route/endpoint + verb, request/response DTO or payload shape, shared type/schema, event/message contract, query/route params. Infer tier layout from `docs/project-config.json` and project conventions.
> 3. **Trace full pipeline end-to-end, in change's direction:**
>     - **Backend change → trace FORWARD to every frontend consumer:** handler/controller → response DTO/serializer → API client/service → store/state → component/template rendering or submitting it.
>     - **Frontend change → trace BACKWARD to backend contract:** component/form → API client call → route/endpoint → request DTO/validation → handler/domain.
>     - When `.code-graph/graph.db` exists, use `$graph-connect-api` and `python .claude/scripts/code_graph trace <file> --direction both --json` to map connection; otherwise grep route path, DTO/type name, each field name across BOTH tiers.
> 4. **Verify BOTH sides still agree** — for every changed seam confirm other tier matches: route path & verb, field names & types, nullability/optionality, required vs optional params, enum values, auth/permission, error/status shape. Any mismatch = **BREAKING** finding (backend change breaks a frontend consumer, or frontend now sends what backend rejects).
> 5. **Classify each seam:** NONE (no contract change) / ADDITIVE (backward-compatible) / BREAKING (consumer on other tier must change too). BREAKING seam whose other-tier consumer NOT updated in same diff = HIGH severity minimum (CRITICAL for auth/money/data-integrity paths).
>
> **Skip ONLY** when change has no cross-tier seam — pure docs, pure styling with no data contract, or single-tier tooling. State explicitly: `Single-tier change — no cross-stack seam`. Backend-only or single-tier repo still traces internal consumers (`SYNC:cross-service-check` for service/event boundaries).

<!-- SYNC:systematic-review-batching -->

> **Systematic Review Batching (map-reduce)** — When a changeset is large, do NOT review files one-by-one. Partition into size-capped batches, fire one specialized sub-agent per batch in parallel, then reduce. This bounds EVERY context — each batch agent AND the orchestrator — so coverage stays complete as file count grows.
>
> **Trigger ladder (one ordered escalation — not competing thresholds):**
>
> 1. **< 10 changed files** → sequential per-file review (default; no batching).
> 2. **≥ 10 changed files** → switch to systematic parallel mode. Announce: `"Detected {N} changed files. Switching to systematic parallel review protocol."` Then: categorize → size-capped batches → flat consolidation.
> 3. **categories > 6 OR files > 40** → additionally insert the hierarchical synthesis tier (below). Everything from rung 2 still applies.
>
> **Step 1 — Categorize.** Group changed files into logical categories derived from the project's actual structure (not forced). Category is the *concern axis*; orient with these examples, derive what fits the repository:
>
> | Category Type | Example Groupings |
> | --- | --- |
> | Agent/Tooling | AI scripts, hooks, skill definitions, workflow configs, linting rules |
> | Root config/docs | Root README, project config, CI/CD pipeline configs |
> | Reference docs | Architecture docs, patterns references, setup guides |
> | Feature/domain docs | Business feature documentation, spec files, ADRs |
> | Backend logic | Service/handler/controller source (infer from project structure) |
> | Frontend logic | UI component/state/API source (infer from project structure) |
> | Data/Schema | Migrations, schema files, seed data |
> | Tests | Unit, integration, E2E test files |
> | Infrastructure | Docker, k8s, CI/CD, cloud manifests |
>
> **Step 2 — Size-capped batches.** One sub-agent per batch of **≤8 files OR ≤2000 diff-lines**, whichever hits first. Category stays the concern axis, but any category exceeding a cap splits into multiple size-capped batches (30 backend files → 4 batches). Size caps — not category caps — make "many files" safe: a category cap alone lets one giant category blow a single agent's context.
>
> **Step 2a — Sub-agent type per batch** (match the batch's dominant concern):
>
> - Code logic (any stack) → `code-reviewer`
> - Security-sensitive changes → `security-auditor`
> - Performance-critical paths → `performance-optimizer`
> - Docs, plans, specs, configs, infra → `general-purpose`
>
> Each batch sub-agent receives: its full file list; `SYNC:category-review-thinking` as its primary thinking model — derive each category's concerns from first principles, NOT a fixed checklist (if the consuming skill does not carry that block, apply category-first thinking directly); project reference docs relevant to its concern (discover via `*patterns*`, `*conventions*`, `*style-guide*`); cross-reference verification instructions (counts, tables, links). All batch agents run in parallel and write findings to `tmp/reports/` (per `SYNC:task-tracking-external-report`); reducers read from disk, never from memory.
>
> **Step 3 — Reduce.**
>
> - **Flat reduction (rung 2, ≤6 categories AND ≤40 files):** the orchestrator collects each batch report, cross-references counts/tables/contracts ACROSS batches, detects gaps visible only across categories (feature in code but missing from docs; new API endpoint with no client call), and consolidates into one categorized holistic report.
> - **Hierarchical reduction (rung 3, > 6 categories OR > 40 files):** insert a mid-tier — each concern gets ONE synthesizer agent that reads only its own batch reports and emits a single concern-synthesis. The orchestrator reads the **concern-syntheses (~5)**, never the raw batch reports — keeping the reducer's context O(#concerns), not O(#files).
>   - **Cross-concern interaction pass (mandatory at rung 3 — closes the synthesis-tier blind spot):** concern-siloed synthesis can drop an interaction spanning two concerns AND two batches (tainted source in data-layer/batch 7 → sink in api/batch 3). So: (a) each concern-synthesizer MUST emit an explicit **"cross-concern interaction candidates"** list — entities/symbols/contracts it touched that plausibly bind to another concern (shared DTOs, event names, table/collection names, exported symbols); (b) the orchestrator MUST run the Step-3 cross-reference/gap step **over those candidate lists across all concern-syntheses**, not only within a batch, before concluding. Without this pass the tier trades completeness for context-bounding on exactly the large diffs it targets.
>
> **Step 4 — Holistic assessment.** With all findings combined, judge: overall coherence as a unified intent; cross-category sync (docs match code? contracts match callers?); risk areas where categories interact; missing doc/spec updates for changed artifacts.
>
> **No silent truncation.** If any cap forces sampling or a batch is dropped for budget, ANNOUNCE the dropped/sampled scope explicitly — bounded coverage must never read as complete coverage.

<!-- SYNC:design-patterns-quality -->

> **Design Quality** — Be opinionated about changeability, and choose techniques by their preconditions. For brownfield work, project config, references, accepted decisions, and current code define the local architecture; do not silently replace a settled pattern. For a new non-trivial system, treat the options below as hypotheses; use the domain, change, and deployment boundaries to select a fit, not a universal target architecture.
>
> 1. **DRY the knowledge, not merely the text.** Keep one owner for a business rule or policy that must change together. Similar-looking code with different reasons to change may stay separate; extract shared functions, modules, types, or components when a real consumer and lower change cost justify them.
> 2. **Give modules explicit responsibilities and dependency direction.** A modular monolith can fit a new application with one release boundary and no evidenced need for independent deployment, scaling, compliance, availability, or runtime; choose another topology when measured ownership or operating boundaries require it. Use Clean/Hexagonal/Ports-and-Adapters ideas to keep policy independent of volatile infrastructure when that boundary buys testability or change isolation. Add layers only when each owns a real contract; split deployment/services only for a demonstrated scaling, ownership, availability, compliance, or release need.
> 3. **Model the domain to its actual complexity.** Use DDD language, aggregates, value objects, and explicit invariants where domain rules and lifecycle matter. Keep straightforward CRUD workflows simple; do not add tactical DDD ceremony without domain complexity.
> 4. **Use events for real decoupling.** Domain/integration events and messaging fit asynchronous reactions or independently owned modules/services. Define idempotency, ordering, retry/recovery, and an outbox/CDC strategy when delivery crosses a durable boundary. Use a direct call inside one consistency boundary when asynchronous delivery adds no value.
> 5. **Use Repository and Unit of Work at meaningful persistence boundaries.** They fit when they protect aggregate/query contracts, isolate a changing persistence technology, or coordinate a real transaction. Do not wrap every ORM call in a generic repository or add a Unit of Work that duplicates the platform's transaction behavior.
> 6. **Apply OOP/SOLID where the language and model use objects.** Prefer cohesive responsibilities, dependency inversion at volatile boundaries, and composition before inheritance; avoid interface-per-class and abstractions with no second implementation or test seam. In functional or data-oriented code, preserve the same cohesion, explicit dependencies, and small contracts without forcing classes.
> 7. **Build UI from cohesive components.** Keep state at the narrowest useful owner; use a store for state genuinely shared across components/routes or for coordinated async data. Add caching only with a freshness/invalidation policy and evidence of a repeated or expensive read. Use the framework's reactive model for composable asynchronous changes and dispose subscriptions/resources by its lifecycle. Apply BEM when the project uses SCSS/BEM; otherwise follow the selected CSS modules, utility, or naming method.
> 8. **Place behavior with its invariant/data owner.** Trace callers and dependencies; use the owner selected by the project's architecture. Do not assume Entity > Service > Controller, or any other fixed layer order.
> 9. **After extraction/move/rename:** grep the full affected scope for dangling references. Preserve project naming/style and verify caller contracts before changing an abstraction.
>
> **Selection gate:** read project config, references, accepted decisions, and comparable implementations. Name the problem/precondition a chosen pattern solves, the simpler alternative, and the trade-off. Configuration may select a stack-specific pattern; it does not make an unjustified abstraction free.
>
> **Review dimensions:** use focused passes over applicable concerns, then group repeated, evidenced violations when they share one cause. A repeated smell is not automatically a defect; name the damaged quality attribute and project-specific consequence.

<!-- SYNC:complexity-prevention -->

> **Complexity Prevention (Ousterhout)** — Use change cost as a review lens, not as a technology checklist. Apply each concern only when its code path and project architecture make it relevant; absence of a pattern is not a defect.
>
> 1. **Change amplification** — estimate edit sites for a plausible change in this area. Several coordinated edits may indicate duplication or a missing owner, but assess cohesion and trade-offs before calling it structural.
> 2. **Cognitive load** — look for unnecessary dependencies, implicit ordering, boolean traps, hidden state, or nesting that makes a local change hard to reason about.
> 3. **Repeated cross-cutting behavior** — where logging, validation, authorization, error handling, or transactions recur, consider an existing shared mechanism that fits the project's runtime; do not prescribe middleware/interceptors/aspects where none exist.
> 4. **Leaked implementation detail** — when an abstraction boundary exists, check whether callers depend on provider/query/storage details unnecessarily. ORM queries, cursors, repositories, and query sets are examples only.
> 5. **Scattered variant logic** — repeated switches or conditionals over the same discriminator may signal a useful owner or dispatch point; retain simple local branches when they fit better.
> 6. **Invariant ownership** — verify that rules are protected by the owner chosen in this architecture. Rich entities, value objects, functional modules, and service-owned rules are all valid when consistent with project evidence.
> 7. **Primitive/domain types** — introduce a richer type only when it reduces repeated validation or protects an evidenced invariant; do not wrap every primitive by default.
> 8. **Cross-cutting policy** — centralize recurring policy when the project has a suitable extension point; one-off behavior may remain local.
> 9. **Module depth** — assess whether an abstraction hides meaningful work or adds more concepts than it removes; class/interface counts are examples, not requirements.
> 10. **Repeated lifecycle behavior** — repeated component, handler, job, or resource lifecycle may justify the project's idiomatic abstraction (function, hook, composable, trait, class, or helper), but only after fit and consumer evidence.
> 11. **Abstraction timing** — repetition triggers evaluation, not automatic extraction. Compare the cost of duplication with the indirection and future variation an abstraction creates.
> 12. **Reusable algorithms** — when a non-trivial stack-generic algorithm repeats, prefer a coherent existing helper or an evidenced shared owner; do not create utility layers for hypothetical reuse.
> 13. **Place computation with its data and invariant owner** — trace callers and use the architecture's documented responsibility model. There is no universal controller/service/entity/model order.
> 14. **Extraction decision** — move or share a rule when doing so gives it one clear owner or serves real consumers. A single use is not sufficient evidence by itself; keep code local when extraction would add ceremony.
>
> **Illustrative shapes only:** entity method, DTO mapper, domain service, application service, pure function, module, middleware, repository, store, or component can be appropriate depending on project evidence. Never use this list as a required target architecture.
>
> **Operating heuristics:** read callers and sibling implementations, count affected edit sites, prefer removing unnecessary code, surface assumptions at boundaries, and ask what changes when the requirement shifts. Measure good code by safe change cost in its actual context, not by a universal layer diagram.

Review purpose: `review → validate findings → fix validated findings that block the current round → full re-review` until a complete review pass clears the round's exit bar (see **Severity floor** below). **A clean review ENDS the loop once the persisted `minRounds` is met (default 1); an explicitly declared minimum such as 2 still requires that independent pass.**
>
> _aka **Self-Review Convergence Loop**._ "Double-round-trip" means a validated-finding fix cycle forces at least one fresh re-review. The loop is bounded by the **2-round ceiling — extendable ONCE to round 3 when CRITICAL/HIGH remain**. A failing **test gate** (a suite that must actually pass) is outside that ceiling: the loop keeps fixing and re-running until the tests pass.
>
> **Round cap — 2 rounds MAX, extendable ONCE to round 3 (a ceiling, NEVER a target).** A clean pass ENDS the loop at ANY round once `round >= minRounds`; the cap never obliges an extra round. When round 2 completes with blocking findings still open (severity floor applied):
>
> - **Validated CRITICAL or HIGH still open → ONE extra round is granted (round 3, the review hard cap).** A failed non-test binary gate (security must-fix, required artifact, generated parity, policy compliance) counts as a CRITICAL blocker here. The extension is earned by that evidence alone, granted at most once per run, and never renews.
> - **Only MEDIUM (or an unresolved `NOT VERIFIABLE`) still open → NO extension.** → **STOP and escalate by asking the user directly** with the still-open findings listed.
> - **Round 3 completes with ANY review blocker still open → STOP and escalate by asking the user directly.** No review finding or non-test gate opens a round 4.
> - **A failing TEST gate → NO round cap, at any round.** Failing tests never escalate for budget or no-progress and never buy or spend the extension: run the failed-test investigation gate, fix at the owning layer, and re-run until the tests pass — past round 3 if needed. NEVER weaken an assertion, add a skip, or relax a timeout to force green.
>
> NEVER emit a silent "good enough" PASS on cap exhaustion, and NEVER loop past round 3 on review blockers. The 2-repeated-no-progress blocker rule stays an EARLIER exit — escalate at whichever trips first.
>
> **Severity floor — from round 2, LOW stops blocking.** One predicate everywhere: `blocking_findings(round, findings)` returns all validated findings in round 1 and only validated CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM findings from round 2 onward. A binary gate (test-green, security must-fix, required artifact) is exempt only when its owning invariant explicitly says so; in practice binary gates always remain blocking when they fail.
>
> | Round | Exit bar — loop ENDS when the fresh full review has… | Must be fixed to continue |

>
> **Severity-floor rules:**
>
> - **Never silently drop a deferred LOW.** List every unfixed LOW under `## Deferred LOW Findings (severity floor, round ≥2)` with file, line, and description; dropping it is a protocol violation, not a clean pass.
> - **Never re-tier a finding to trigger the exit, or to reach or dodge the extension.** Demoting a real CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM to LOW, promoting a MEDIUM to HIGH to buy round 3, or demoting a CRITICAL/HIGH to force an earlier escalation is a FALSE classification. Severity is set by consequence before the round bar and the extension test apply. — why: a bound reachable by relabeling bounds nothing.
> - **The floor bounds the loop, not the standard.** It ends *iteration*; it never authorizes shipping a known CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM, and never lowers the finding-survival bar.
> - **The floor never applies to a hard gate.** Test-green, security must-fix, and any binary (not severity-rated) gate are unaffected — a failing test is a failure, not a LOW finding.
>
> **Universal scope (any new output/judgment):** any newly produced output or judgment gets **≥1 self-review**; any **new judgment** gets **≥1 `$why-review --validate-findings` pass**; anything flagged to re-check is re-checked **≥1 time** before it is final.
>
> **Routing invariant (author-facing):** a skill that validates findings MUST route them through `$why-review --validate-findings` (the terminal validator) — NEVER fork an inline finding-validation; the `verify-review-validate-coverage` sensor enforces this route mechanically.
>
> **Round 1:** Main-session review; output findings + verdict (PASS / FAIL). Then:
>
> - **No issues found (PASS, zero findings)** → review ENDS if `round >= minRounds`; otherwise perform the explicitly required independent pass. Do NOT invent a confirmation pass.
> - **`blocking_findings(round, findings)` is non-empty** → run the active review skill's findings-validation gate first (default `$why-review --validate-findings <report-path>`). Fix only validated findings that block the current round, then restart the full review protocol with a fresh task breakdown.
>
> **Fresh full re-review after every fix cycle:** re-run the whole review protocol over the current full target. When it uses sub-agents, spawn NEW `spawn_agent` calls — never reuse prior agents; reviewers re-read ALL files with ZERO memory of prior rounds (`SYNC:fresh-context-review` for the spawn mechanism, `SYNC:review-protocol-injection` for the prompt template). Each pass hunts missed cross-cutting concerns, interactions between changed files, convention drift, missing pieces, rationalized edge cases, and regressions from the fixes.
>
> **Loop termination:** after each full re-review, apply **that round's exit bar**: bar cleared and persisted minimum met → END; otherwise validate → fix → restart. Escalate by asking the user directly at whichever comes first: the same validated finding repeats for 2 full invocations with no progress · a fix requires product/owner input · round 2 completes with MEDIUM-only (or `NOT VERIFIABLE`) blocking · round 3 completes with any review blocker open. A failing test gate triggers none of these — it loops until green. NEVER convert cap exhaustion into a PASS.
>
> **Rules:**
>
> - A clean Round 1 ENDS the review when `minRounds=1`; an explicitly declared `minRounds=2` requires the independent second pass
> - LOW-only rounds from round 2 are listed as deferred, never fixed in a new round N+1
> - NEVER fix unvalidated findings; validate first using the caller's validation gate
> - Every surviving finding must also clear why-review's **finding-survival bar** (Findings Validation Routine — stricter than the generic act-gate); a finding below it is demoted or dropped

<!-- SYNC:fresh-context-review -->

> **Fresh Context Re-Review** — Eliminate orchestrator confirmation bias after fixes by restarting the full review with isolated sub-agents where applicable. A report-only/read-only reviewer never edits source, generated output, or user data: it validates and records the finding/repair handoff, then returns to the caller, which owns the fix and any re-review.
>
> **Why:** The main agent knows what it (or `$feature-implement`) just fixed and rationalizes findings accordingly. A fresh sub-agent has ZERO memory, re-reads from scratch, and catches what the main agent dismissed. Sub-agent bias is mitigated by (1) fresh context, (2) verbatim protocol injection, (3) main agent not filtering the report.
>
> **When:** After a validated-finding fix cycle, or to satisfy an explicitly declared independent-pass `minRounds`. A review round that finds zero issues ENDS the loop once that persisted minimum is met — do NOT invent a confirmation sub-agent. A review round that finds issues triggers: validate findings → fix → full review restart from the first phase.
>
> **How:**
>
> 1. Start a NEW full review invocation/task breakdown; when that protocol calls for agents, spawn NEW `spawn_agent` tool calls — use `code-reviewer` agent_type for code reviews, `general-purpose` for plan/doc/artifact reviews
> 2. Inject ALL required review protocols VERBATIM into the prompt — see `SYNC:review-protocol-injection` for the full list and template. A reviewer prompt carries every protocol body inline and is never handed a path to go read (the reviewer-prompt rule of `SYNC:shared-protocol-duplication-policy`)
> 3. Sub-agent re-reads ALL target files from scratch via its own tool calls — never pass file contents inline in the prompt
> 4. Sub-agent writes structured report to `tmp/reports/{review-type}-round{N}-{date}.md`
> 5. Main agent reads the report, integrates findings into its own report, DOES NOT override or filter
>
> **Rules:**
>
> - SKIP fresh sub-agent when the prior full review found zero issues AND the persisted `minRounds` is met (no fixes or required independent pass = nothing new to verify)
> - NEVER skip the full review restart after a fix cycle — every fix invalidates the prior verdict
> - NEVER reuse a sub-agent across rounds — every fresh round spawns a NEW `spawn_agent` call
> - Continue until a complete full review pass clears that round's exit bar per `SYNC:double-round-trip-review`: **round 1** → zero findings at any severity; **round 2 (and the conditional round 3)** → zero CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM, so a round whose validated findings are ALL LOW ENDS the loop once the persisted minimum is met (list those LOWs as deferred instead of spawning another round). The budget is 2 rounds plus ONE extension to round 3, granted only when round 2 leaves a validated CRITICAL/HIGH open (a failed non-test binary gate counts as CRITICAL); round 3 is the review hard cap. A failing test gate is not budgeted — keep fixing and re-running until the tests pass. If the same validated blocker repeats across 2 full invocations with no progress, escalate by asking the user directly. **Read-only/report-only role boundary:** when this block is carried by a security auditor or another report-only role, “fix” means return the validated repair proposal to the parent; do not modify source, generated carriers, or user data and do not restart the review locally.
> - Persist completed rounds, repeated blockers, findings and the explicit minimum in the owning run's `review-policy.cjs` record.

<!-- /SYNC:fresh-context-review -->

<!-- SYNC:review-protocol-injection -->

> **Review Protocol Injection** — Every fresh sub-agent review prompt MUST embed 11 protocol blocks VERBATIM, copied WHOLESALE and unmodified. They are the review-tier renderings of their canonical `SYNC:` tags, not literal copies; when a canonical protocol changes, update the matching body here in the same edit. Copy the template wholesale into the Agent call's `prompt` field at runtime, replacing only the `{placeholders}` in Task / Round / Reference Docs / Target Files / Output sections with context-specific values. Do NOT touch the embedded protocol sections.
>
> **Why inline expansion:** A fresh reviewer must hold every rule it reviews against from its first token; a path or a placeholder would make it depend on a file read, or on a hook that may not fire for it. Reviewer prompts are therefore the one place the hybrid policy (`SYNC:shared-protocol-duplication-policy`) always keeps full bodies: the template carries all 11 protocol bodies pre-embedded, and the orchestrator copies it wholesale.

### Subagent Type Selection

- `code-reviewer` — for code reviews (reviewing source files, git diffs, implementation)
- `general-purpose` — for plan / doc / artifact reviews (reviewing markdown plans, docs, specs)

### Canonical Agent Call Template (Copy Verbatim)

```
spawn_agent({
  description: "Fresh Round {N} review",
  agent_type: "code-reviewer",
  prompt: `
## Task
{review-specific task — e.g., "Review all uncommitted changes for code quality" | "Review plan files under {plan-dir}" | "Review integration tests in {path}"}

## Round
Round {N}. You have ZERO memory of prior rounds. Re-read all target files from scratch via your own tool calls. Do NOT trust anything from the main agent beyond this prompt.

## Protocols (follow VERBATIM — these are non-negotiable)

### Spec ↔ Tests ↔ Code Triangulation
DO THIS FIRST — before any per-protocol check below. The review target is the WHOLE PACKAGE, not the diff alone. Read `docs/project-config.json` and resolve `specArtifacts`: a valid profile selects its configured `intent/contracts/evidence` section roles, identifiers, ownership rule, and test-carrier dialects; only an absent profile selects the strict-default business-spec shape (§3 ACs / §4 BRs / §5 invariants / §8 TCs). A malformed or unsupported declaration is `BLOCKED`; never treat it as absent or fall back. Load the governing artifact, its tests, and the changed code TOGETHER, and reason about their mutual consistency BEFORE judging any one in isolation.
1. Locate all three faces: the canonical owner section(s), the tests that guard them, and the production code that implements them. With a native profile, preserve owner path + case/scenario ID + optional variant and resolve each through its configured carrier to the actual test. A missing face is itself a finding (SPEC-GAP / TEST-GAP / DEAD-SPEC).
2. Triangulate pairwise — every disagreement is a finding; classify which face is wrong:
   - code vs spec: behavior the code does that no configured `intent/contracts` rule (or strict-default §3/§4/§5/§8 rule) describes → CODE-EXTRA or SPEC-STALE; a hard contract/invariant with no enforcing path → CODE-WRONG.
   - tests vs spec: a configured native case with no executing assertion, or a test asserting behavior no native rule/case names → TEST-GAP or SPEC-SILENT. Without `specArtifacts`, check strict-default §8 TCs.
   - tests vs code: a changed code path with no covering test → TEST-GAP; a test that still passes against a deliberately broken invariant → WEAK-TEST (apply the mutation thinking in Bug Detection).
3. Hidden-rule capture: any invariant the code enforces but the spec never states (SPEC-SILENT) MUST be surfaced as a finding, added to the profile's configured `intent` or `contracts` section, and linked from its `evidence` section to a native case whose executing assertion is inspected. Without a profile, use strict-default §3/§4/§5/§8 and TC. This is the enrichment loop, never a silent pass.
4. Only after the three faces agree — or every disagreement is logged as a finding — proceed to the per-protocol checks below; when enrichment adds spec/test content, re-review the package against the enriched spec.
NEVER mark review PASS while any spec/test/code face disagrees without a logged finding. The diff is the entry point; the package is the unit of judgment.

### Evidence-Based Reasoning
Speculation is FORBIDDEN. Every claim needs proof.
1. Cite file:line, grep results, or framework docs for EVERY claim
2. Declare confidence: >80% act freely, 60-80% verify first, <60% DO NOT recommend
3. Cross-service validation required for architectural changes
4. "I don't have enough evidence" is valid and expected output
BLOCKED until: Evidence file path (file:line) provided; Grep search performed; 3+ similar patterns found; Confidence level stated.
Forbidden without proof: "obviously", "I think", "should be", "probably", "this is because".
If incomplete → output: "Insufficient evidence. Verified: [...]. Not verified: [...]."

### Bug Detection
MUST check categories 1-4 for EVERY review. Never skip.
1. Null Safety: Can params/returns be null? Are they guarded? Optional chaining gaps? .find() returns checked?
2. Boundary Conditions: Off-by-one (< vs <=)? Empty collections handled? Zero/negative values? Max limits?
3. Error Handling: Try-catch scope correct? Silent swallowed exceptions? Error types specific? Cleanup in finally?
4. Resource Management: Connections/streams closed? Subscriptions unsubscribed on destroy? Timers cleared? Memory bounded?
5. Concurrency (if async): Missing await? Race conditions on shared state? Stale closures? Retry storms?
6. Stack-Specific: Check the configured language/runtime pitfalls and framework-specific failure modes discovered from local code.
Classify every finding by consequence (never by effort): CRITICAL = immediate material security/safety/data-loss risk or failed binary gate → block; HIGH = material correctness, contract, privacy, or authority risk → must fix; MEDIUM = bounded consequential edge/resilience/maintainability gap → must clear the current round, or escalate with an explicit residual-risk follow-up that does not create a clean pass; LOW = non-blocking polish with no credible present impact → record/defer from round 2; `NOT VERIFIABLE` is unresolved evidence, not LOW.

### Design Patterns Quality
Priority checks for every code change:
1. Consistency and reuse: follow documented local patterns; extract a shared abstraction only when repetition or a demonstrated consumer need justifies its cost. Similar names alone do not require a shared base class.
2. Responsibility: follow the architecture established by project configuration, references, accepted decisions, and existing code. Place behavior with its actual owner; do not presume an entity/service/controller hierarchy or forbid a layer without project evidence.
3. Apply cohesion, coupling, and dependency-management principles when their assumptions fit the project's paradigm. SOLID is useful for object-oriented boundaries, not a mandatory checklist for every language or codebase.
4. After extraction/move/rename: Grep ENTIRE scope for dangling references. Zero tolerance.
5. YAGNI gate: Treat repeated patterns as evidence to evaluate extraction, not a numeric threshold. Extract when a shared reason to change, real consumers, or an evidenced ownership/substitution boundary lowers total change cost; do not create patterns for hypothetical future use.
6. Purpose-oriented naming: Name public or cross-layer abstractions by the capability, domain purpose, or contract consumers rely on—not the current provider, SDK, framework, database, or transport. `IStorage`/`Storage` → `AzureBlobStorage`; use `IAzureStorage` only when Azure-specific semantics are intentionally part of the contract.
7. Contract-fit check: Read callers and every implementation before judging a name; narrow an over-broad abstraction (`IObjectStore`, `DocumentStore`) instead of rewarding a generic name that lies about behavior.
8. Mechanism/generic-name smell: Treat `Manager`, `Helper`, `Utils`, `Data`, `Thing`, `Service`, `Interface`, type decorations, and unexplained abbreviations as review signals—not automatic defects; flag them only when they hide purpose, scope, or responsibility.
9. Concrete implementation names: Provider, strategy, transport, or test-double names are valid on concrete types when they distinguish real behavior (`AzureBlobStorage`, `InMemoryStorage`, `RetryingStorage`); keep those details out of the caller-facing contract unless the contract promises them.
10. Language convention: Preserve local interface syntax and naming style; `.NET` `I` prefixes and Google TypeScript's unmarked interfaces are both valid local conventions.
Anti-patterns to flag: God Object, Copy-Paste inheritance, Circular Dependency, Leaky Abstraction.

### Logic & Intention Review
Verify WHAT code does matches WHY it was changed.
1. Change Intention Check: Every changed file MUST serve the stated purpose. Flag unrelated changes as scope creep.
2. Happy Path Trace: Walk through one complete success scenario through changed code.
3. Error Path Trace: Walk through one failure/edge case scenario through changed code.
4. Acceptance Mapping: If plan context available, map every acceptance criterion to a code change.
5. Tests Verify Intent: For test/spec changes, verify tests name the protected business rule or invariant and would fail if that intent breaks.
6. Migration Test Exclusion: Do not write tests for migration code. Schema/data migrations are one-time execution paths, not core application logic.
NEVER mark review PASS without completing both traces (happy + error path).

### Test Spec Verification
Map changed code to test specifications.
1. Identify the project's test/spec format from existing docs, test-case files, BDD feature files, or spec folders.
2. Every changed code path MUST map to a corresponding test case/spec (or flag as "needs test case").
3. New functions/endpoints/handlers → flag for test spec creation.
4. Migration files are excluded from test/spec creation; schema/data migrations are one-time execution paths, not core application logic.
5. If spec evidence fields exist, verify they point to actual code (file:line, not stale references).
6. Verify each meaningful test case names the business intent/invariant; flag behavior-only cases that only mirror implementation details.
7. Auth/data changes → verify corresponding authorization and data-state test cases exist.
8. If no specs exist for a changed path → log the gap and recommend the project's test-spec workflow.
NEVER skip test mapping. Untested code paths are the #1 source of production bugs.

### Behavioral Delta Matrix
MANDATORY for any bugfix review. Produce input-state × pre-fix × post-fix × delta table BEFORE writing verdict.
- Minimum 3 rows; include at least one row OUTSIDE the original bug report.
- Any "REGRESSION" delta → review returns FAIL until a preservation test is added.
- Narrative descriptions do NOT substitute for the matrix.
Example rows (external-record sync fix):
| Input                 | Pre-fix | Post-fix                  | Delta      |
| --------------------- | ------- | ------------------------- | ---------- |
| Record exists (valid) | Reused  | Always recreated → orphan | REGRESSION |
| Record missing (404)  | Error   | Recreated                 | Fixed      |

### Fix-Layer Accountability
Do not assume the crash site owns the defect. Trace the actual execution and data flow, then fix the component that owns the violated contract.
MANDATORY before ANY fix:
1. Trace the affected path — map the real origin, transformations, boundaries, and observed failure in the surfaces this project uses. Do not invent absent layers.
2. Identify the contract owner — use project architecture and code evidence to find which component is responsible for the invalid state or behavior.
3. Choose the correction point — fix the authoritative owner and retain any validation required at untrusted boundaries. A multi-file correction can be valid; justify it by the contracts each file owns rather than a file-count threshold.
4. Check bypass paths — inspect relevant constructors, adapters, parsers, caches, persistence, or other entry points that actually exist in the affected flow.
BLOCKED until: The affected path is traced; the owner is supported by file:line evidence; relevant consumers and bypass paths are checked; and the correction point fits the project's architecture.
Anti-patterns (REJECT): assuming the symptom site is the owner; scattering workarounds without tracing the contract; assuming the lowest technical layer is always authoritative; removing validation from a real trust boundary to force a single correction point.

### Rationalization Prevention
AI skips steps via these evasions. Recognize and reject:
- "Too simple for a plan" → Simple + wrong assumptions = wasted time. Plan anyway.
- "I'll test after" → RED before GREEN. Write/verify test first.
- "Already searched" → Show grep evidence with file:line. No proof = no search.
- "Just do it" → Still need task tracking. Skip depth, never skip tracking.
- "Just a small fix" → Small fix in wrong location cascades. Verify file:line first.
- "Code is self-explanatory" → Future readers need evidence trail. Document anyway.
- "Combine steps to save time" → Combined steps dilute focus. Each step has distinct purpose.

### Graph-Assisted Investigation
MANDATORY when .code-graph/graph.db exists.
HARD-GATE: MUST run at least ONE graph command on key files before concluding any investigation.
Pattern: Grep finds files → trace --direction both reveals full system flow → Grep verifies details.
- Investigation: trace --direction both on 2-3 entry files
- Fix/Debug: callers_of on buggy function + tests_for
- Feature/Enhancement: connections on files to be modified
- Code Review: tests_for on changed functions
- Blast Radius: trace --direction downstream
CLI: python .claude/scripts/code_graph {command} --json. Use --node-mode file first (10-30x less noise), then --node-mode function for detail.

### Understand Code First
HARD-GATE: Do NOT write, plan, or fix until you READ existing code.
1. Search 3+ similar patterns (grep/glob) — cite file:line evidence.
2. Read existing files in target area — understand structure, base classes, conventions.
3. Run python .claude/scripts/code_graph trace <file> --direction both --json when .code-graph/graph.db exists.
4. Map dependencies via connections or callers_of — know what depends on your target.
5. Write investigation to tmp/analysis/ for non-trivial tasks (3+ files).
6. Re-read analysis file before implementing — never work from memory alone.
7. NEVER invent new patterns when existing ones work — match exactly or document deviation.
BLOCKED until: Read target files; Grep 3+ patterns; Graph trace (if graph.db exists); Assumptions verified with evidence.

## Reference Docs (READ before reviewing)
- `.claude/docs/development-rules.md` — canonical development rules, code-quality guidelines, and pre-commit checklist
- `code-review-rules.md`, inside the reference-docs root (default `docs/project-reference`; a `docsRoots.projectReference.path` entry in `docs/project-config.json` overrides the path)
- {skill-specific reference docs — e.g., integration-test-reference.md for integration-test-review; backend-patterns-reference.md for backend reviews; frontend-patterns-reference.md for frontend reviews}

## Target Files
{explicit file list OR "run git diff to see uncommitted changes" OR "read all files under {plan-dir}"}

## Output
Write a structured report to tmp/reports/{review-type}-round{N}-{date}.md with sections:
- Status: PASS | FAIL
- Issue Count: {number}
- Critical Issues (with file:line evidence)
- High Priority Issues (with file:line evidence)
- Medium / Low Issues
- Cross-cutting findings

Return the report path and status to the main agent.
Every finding MUST have file:line evidence. Speculation is forbidden.
`
})
```

### Rules

- DO copy the template wholesale — including all 11 embedded protocol sections
- DO replace only the `{placeholders}` in Task / Round / Reference Docs / Target Files / Output sections with context-specific content
- DO choose `code-reviewer` agent_type for code reviews and `general-purpose` for plan / doc / artifact reviews
- DO NOT paraphrase, summarize, or skip any protocol section
- DO NOT pass file contents inline — the sub-agent reads via its own tool calls so it has a fresh context
- DO NOT reference protocols by file path or tag name — the bodies are already embedded above
- DO NOT introduce placeholder markers for the protocols — they must stay literally expanded

A failed binary gate is a separate hard blocker (represented as synthetic CRITICAL by the executable policy), not an ordinary tier judgment.
> - **HIGH → must fix before PASS/merge:** wrong behavior on a supported path, violated business/data invariant, meaningful privacy/authority gap, breaking contract/compatibility change, likely material harm, or missing proof for a behavior-changing fix.
> - **MEDIUM → clear before the current round can pass:** a bounded but consequential edge case, resilience/observability/testability/maintainability gap, credible future defect, or local architectural drift with real impact but no immediate material loss. If the fix needs an owner/product decision, stop and escalate with an explicit follow-up and residual-risk record; that record is not a clean-pass waiver.
> - **LOW → record/defer from round 2 onward:** wording/formatting, minor documentation or convention drift, optional defensive cleanup, or cosmetic refinement with no credible present correctness, security, privacy, authority, availability, or data-integrity impact.
> Assign the highest tier supported by evidence. An observation is not a finding until it names the affected asset/user/data/contract, consequence, evidence, and tier. Effort, annoyance, implementation cost, and proximity to the round cap are never severity inputs. `NOT VERIFIABLE` is an evidence state, not a tier; if the unresolved claim could affect a required behavior or binary gate, keep it blocking until proved or explicitly owner-accepted with residual risk. Failed tests, parity, required artifacts, and security-must-fix checks are binary gates and block independently of severity. For the full decision tree, boundary examples, score mappings, and domain-vocabulary normalization, follow `SYNC:severity-rubric`.

> **Step 1 — Understand the category's role.** What is this category responsible for in the overall system? What invariants must it uphold? What are its consumer contracts (who depends on it, what do they expect)?
>
> **Step 2 — Read project conventions for this category.** Search for reference docs, style guides, ADRs, or READMEs specific to this area.

>
> **Step 3 — Derive concerns from first principles.** Apply all that are relevant; expand beyond this list based on the actual category:
>
> - **Correctness:** Does the logic match the intent? Trace happy path AND error path.
> - **Boundary contracts:** Are interfaces/APIs/events/protocols honored? No implicit coupling introduced?
> - **Project conventions:** Does new code follow the patterns found in Step 2? Evidence-confirmed, not assumed.
> - **Security:** Auth enforced at every entry point? Input validated at boundaries? No secrets in the diff?
> - **Performance:** Unbounded operations? N+1 patterns? Blocking calls in async context? Unindexed queries?
> - **Maintainability:** DRY? Single responsibility? Complexity within reason? Names reveal intent?
> - **Boundary naming:** When the category exposes public or cross-layer types, APIs, events, or modules, verify that names describe the capability, domain purpose, or contract rather than the current provider/framework/transport; concrete adapters may carry those details. Check callers and implementations before flagging a name, and treat generic names (`Manager`, `Helper`, `Utils`, `Data`) as signals rather than automatic violations.
> - **Test coverage:** Are the changed paths covered by tests? Are existing tests still valid after the change?
> - **Documentation:** Do related docs, specs, or READMEs reflect the changes?
>
> **Step 4 — Create sub-tasks and execute.** For each identified concern: create a task tracking sub-task, work through it with `file:line` evidence, mark done. No findings without proof.

> - _Documentation:_ accurate? Links valid? Examples still match current code/behavior? Covers new scenarios?

> **Nested Task Expansion Contract** — For workflow-step invocation, the `[Workflow] ...` row is only a parent container; the child skill still creates visible phase tasks.
>
> 1. Call the current task list first. If a matching active parent workflow row exists, set `nested=true` and record `parentTaskId`; otherwise run standalone.
> 2. Create one task per declared phase before phase work. When nested, prefix subjects `[N.M] /skill-name — phase`.
> 3. When nested, link the parent with `TaskUpdate(parentTaskId, addBlockedBy: [childIds])`.
> 4. Orchestrators must pre-expand a child skill's phase list and link the workflow row before invoking that child skill or sub-agent.
> 5. Mark exactly one child `in_progress` before work and `completed` immediately after evidence is written.
> 6. Complete the parent only after all child tasks are completed or explicitly cancelled with reason.

<!-- SYNC:project-reference-docs-guide -->

> **Project Reference Docs Gate (static JIT)** — Run after task-tracking bootstrap, immediately before target/source reads, grep, edits, tests, or analysis. Project docs override generic framework assumptions; hooks may remind or accelerate this gate but never prove it ran.
>
> 1. **Scope** — identify file types, domain area, and operation.
> 2. **Project config is OPTIONAL.** Read the configured project-config file via its loader (default `docs/project-config.json`) when it exists. Absent is a supported state, not an error: run on portable defaults, derive project facts (paths, commands, conventions, architecture, test/spec layout) from repository evidence (manifests, lockfiles, scripts, CI, layout, root instruction files), state material assumptions, never block, and at most OFFER `$project-init` or `$project-config` once. Present → minimum valid shape is a non-empty `project.name`; omitted optional capabilities use neutral defaults or skip. A DECLARED section left malformed or incomplete is a configuration error: fail closed on it and run `$project-init` or `$project-config` before relying on it — why: silent defaults would present wrong facts as authoritative. Verify material config hints against repository evidence; generic defaults are never project facts.
> 3. **Select docs.** Always-on: the project-init-owned `lessons.md` and docs-index inputs at their configured owner paths — read independently, never appended to `referenceDocs`. Task-specific: an explicit `referenceDocs` array is the exact selection, subsets and `[]` included; absent → the runtime capability-aware resolver (portable baseline plus configuration- or repository-evidenced capabilities; may be empty). The scan-target manifest is a registry, not a default selection. Filenames resolve under the reference-docs root (default `docs/project-reference`; `docsRoots.projectReference.path` in `docs/project-config.json` overrides it). Custom-doc schema, ownership, and path-safety rules: `.claude/skills/scan/references/targets.md`.
> 4. **Route by phase.** Just in time, read the selected docs the table names for the phase you are ABOUT to enter, plus any selected custom doc whose `purpose` covers that phase. An unmatched row is `Not applicable`, never a blocker.
>
> | About to… | Read first (when selected and present) |
> | --- | --- |
> | investigate, explain, plan, design, estimate | `project-structure-reference.md`, `domain-entities-reference.md`, plus the edit-row docs for every file type the plan will touch |
> | edit or write code | `code-review-rules.md`, plus server-side / non-UI code → `backend-patterns-reference.md`; UI → `frontend-patterns-reference.md`, `scss-styling-guide.md`, `design-system/README.md` |
> | write, run, fix, or review tests or test data | the matching kind: `integration-test-reference.md` · `e2e-test-reference.md` · `seed-test-data-reference.md` |
> | author or change specs, test cases, or docs | `feature-spec-reference.md`, `spec-system-reference.md`, `spec-principles.md`; `workflow-spec-test-code-cycle-reference.md` when specs, tests, and code must stay in sync |
> | review a diff, plan, spec, or artifact | `code-review-rules.md`, plus the edit/test/spec-row docs for every file type under review |
>
> 5. **Per-file conventions** (`contextGroups[]` in the project config) add rules for the exact file read or edited: hooks deliver them where they run; elsewhere run `node .claude/hooks/lib/file-conventions.cjs --lookup <path>` before the first edit of an unfamiliar path class.
> 6. **Cite and repair.** State `Reference docs read: ... | Not applicable: ...` (record an explicit empty selection); still honor references the active skill or task requires. A missing/stale always-on input or selected/required doc, or a malformed declared config section → `$project-init` or the narrow owner route (`$project-config`, `$docs-init`, `$scan --target=<key>`, `$ai-context-refresh`) before relying on it.
> 7. **Dedup within ~200K tokens.** A doc counts as loaded only when its full content came back to THIS context from your own read, after the last compaction and within roughly the last 200K tokens, and it has not changed since — list it in `Reference docs read:` as `<doc> (loaded)` and skip the re-read. Everything else is not loaded: a hook reminder, a summary, a doc merely named in the conversation, or a read by another agent. Re-select and re-read after compaction, resume, a material context change, or ~200K tokens of growth (= the file-convention hook default). A delegated sub-agent starts empty: name the resolved doc paths in its brief.
>
> **Ready when:** scope set · config read or its absence recorded · always-on inputs confirmed · selection applied (may be empty) · phase docs read or cited `(loaded)` · citation emitted.

<!-- SYNC:source-test-drift-check -->

> **Source/test drift check.** For coding, fix, debug, investigation, test, or review work: when source behavior changes, inspect affected unit/integration/E2E tests and decide from evidence whether tests should change to match intended behavior or the source change is an unintended bug to fix. Do not write tests for migration code; schema/data migrations are one-time execution paths, not core application logic.

<!-- /SYNC:source-test-drift-check -->

<!-- SYNC:spec-drift-adjudication -->

> **Spec drift adjudication (code-wrong vs spec-stale).** Whenever behavior diverges from a canonical owner artifact under the configured business root (`specRoots.business.path`, default `docs/specs`), you MUST NOT silently pick a side. Resolve and validate `specArtifacts` from `docs/project-config.json`: when valid, use its `intent/contracts/evidence` section roles and native case carriers; only when absent, use the strict-default Feature Spec sections (§3 AC, §4 BR, §5 invariant, §8 TC). A malformed or unsupported declaration blocks; never fall back. Adjudicate per `shared/sdd-artifact-contract.md` → **Drift Gates**:
>
> 1. **Detect** — compare the change against the owner's documented intent/contracts and linked evidence. No divergence → record `Spec in sync` and move on.
> 2. **Classify** the divergence:
>    - **CODE-WRONG** — the owner artifact correctly states intended behavior and the change violates it → BLOCKING finding; fix the code/test against intended behavior, creating or updating a regression case in the configured native carrier (strict-default TC when no profile exists).
>    - **SPEC-STALE** — the change is the new intended behavior and the owner now documents the old/wrong behavior → update the canonical owner FIRST through the configured spec workflow, then synchronize its evidence/test carriers. Without a profile, use `$spec [mode=update]`, `$spec [mode=tests]`, then `$spec [mode=sync]`.
>    - **AMBIGUOUS** — intended behavior is unclear → ask the user or canonical spec owner before editing either side.
>    - **SPEC-SILENT** — code correctly enforces an invariant/behavior absent from the owner artifact → not drift but an UNWRITTEN rule. Prove it is always-true (≥2 enforcement points or a rejecting guard), express it as a universally-quantified property, add it to the configured `intent` or `contracts` section, and link it from `evidence` to a native case with an inspected assertion. Without a profile, use the invariant-harvest workflow to add the rule to strict-default §4 (or §3/§5) and a guarding §8 TC. A discovered invariant left only in code or tests is INCOMPLETE.
> 3. **Never normalize drift just because code/tests are green** — green can encode the drift itself. Reconcile to canonical intent, never to whichever side currently passes.
>
> A behavior-changing review/implementation that leaves a spec divergence unadjudicated is INCOMPLETE; an unwritten-but-enforced invariant left uncaptured in the configured owner and case evidence (strict-default §4/§8) is equally INCOMPLETE.

<!-- SYNC:ai-mistake-prevention -->

> **AI Mistake Prevention** — Failure modes to avoid on every task:
>
> **Project applicability gate.** Before applying a stack, layer, style, tool, or architecture rule, read the project's config and relevant references, then check local implementations. Treat framework examples as examples; honor explicit N/A and do not require a technology or convention the project does not use.
> **ROOT-CAUSE GATE — INVESTIGATE FIRST.** Before applying any project-related correction, always use the project's root-cause investigation protocol and establish the cause; the failure site may be only a symptom.
> **FAILED-TEST GATE.** For any failed or unstable test, use the project's test-investigation protocol before editing source or tests; never change either side merely to force green.
> **Re-read files after context changes.** Compaction, resume, or long-running work makes memory stale; verify current files before acting.
> **Verify generated content against source evidence.** AI hallucinates APIs, names, claims, and document facts; check the source before documenting or referencing.
> **Check downstream references before deleting or renaming.** Map the docs, generated mirrors, configs, and callers a removal can stale.
> **Trace the full impact chain after edits, and verify ALL affected outputs.** A changed definition reaches derived outputs and consumers; one green check is not all green checks.
> **Assume existing values are intentional — ask WHY before changing OR flagging one as a defect.** Before changing or reporting a constant, limit, flag, cutoff, wording, or pattern, read nearby context and history, the CALLER's ordering, and 2+ sibling call sites of the same convention. A doc stating WHAT without WHY is missing rationale, not proof of a missing guard.
> **Surface ambiguity before acting — don't pick silently.** Multiple valid interpretations require an explicit question or stated assumption with risk.
> **Assert the outcome your system owns, not the intermediate state your infrastructure owns.** When verifying async work, assert the final business state — never delivery/retry bookkeeping in shared infrastructure that any co-running process can write; such a check passes alone and flakes once anything shares that infrastructure.
> **Store disposable generated output in the project workspace.** If an output can be regenerated and is not source code, a canonical source-of-truth, or an intentionally versioned projection, write it under the project-root `tmp/` or `temp/` directory (prefer `tmp/`), scoped to the run. This includes temporary state, integration/E2E results, reports, logs, screenshots, traces, videos, coverage, dumps, and candidate evidence. Never put these outputs in source, docs, the plans root (default `plans/`; a `docsRoots.plans.path` entry in `docs/project-config.json` overrides the path), the team-artifacts root (default `team-artifacts/`; `docsRoots.teamArtifacts.path` in the same config overrides the path), or mirror directories; the project-root `.gitignore` must ignore `/tmp/` and `/temp/` by default. Committed fixtures, accepted baselines, canonical specs/docs, and explicitly versioned generated mirrors remain at their declared owner paths.
> **Judge the environment before judging the code.** A bug report, failed test, error, or unexpected output is not proof of a code defect. Weigh environment causes as a competing hypothesis — setup, config, version and dependency state, service dependencies, stale artifacts or leftover state, and transient resource pressure (RAM, CPU, disk, handles, network). State the discriminator you ran; fix an environment cause in the environment, never by editing product code or weakening a test to absorb it.
> **Keep shared guidance role-relevant.** Universal guidance must help every receiving skill or agent; code-specific obligations belong only in code-specific protocols.

<!-- SYNC:severity-rubric -->

> **Severity Rubric** — Classify every finding by consequence, not by effort, reviewer preference, or how annoying the fix is. One scale applies to every review, skill, agent, workflow, and host so a tier means the same everywhere. Choose the highest credible consequence supported by evidence; do not lower a tier to make a round pass.
>
> **Finding vs observation (required):** An observation becomes a finding only when it names the affected user/system/data/contract, the shipped consequence, the evidence location, and the normalized tier. `INFO`, advice, preference, duplicate wording, or an unsubstantiated concern is not a finding and must not reopen a loop. If the concern might affect a required behavior or gate but evidence is incomplete, emit `NOT VERIFIABLE` with the missing evidence and keep it unresolved; never silently convert uncertainty into LOW.
>
> | Severity | Action | Definition and examples |
> | --- | --- | --- |
> | CRITICAL | Block immediately; escalate | Immediate material risk if shipped: authentication/authorization or safety bypass; secrets/PII exposure; irreversible destructive action; data loss/corruption; a silent failure on a critical path. A failed binary gate is carried by the executable policy as a separate synthetic blocker, not an ordinary severity judgment. |
> | HIGH | Must fix before PASS/merge | Material correctness or contract risk: wrong behavior on a supported path; violated business/data invariant; meaningful privacy or authority gap; breaking API/schema/compatibility change; likely harm to users/downstream systems; a missing proof for a behavior-changing fix. |
> | MEDIUM | Must clear the current round; escalate if the fix needs an owner decision | Bounded but consequential risk: an edge case, resilience/observability/testability/maintainability gap, credible future defect, or local architectural drift — real impact, not immediate material loss. A recorded follow-up does not make an open MEDIUM a clean pass. |
> | LOW | Record and defer; never opens another fix/re-review round from round 2 onward, never counts toward the round-3 extension | Non-blocking polish with no credible present correctness, security, privacy, authority, availability, or data-integrity impact: wording/formatting, minor documentation or convention drift, optional defensive cleanup, cosmetic refinement. |
>
> **Consequence decision tree (apply in order):** (1) A failed binary gate stays a separate hard blocker (synthetic CRITICAL in the executable helper) — never hide it behind an ordinary label. Otherwise, would shipping permit immediate material security/safety/authority harm, irreversible destruction, data loss/corruption, or a critical-path silent failure? → **CRITICAL**. (2) Does a supported path, invariant, public contract, privacy/authority boundary, compatibility promise, or behavior-changing proof fail with material impact? → **HIGH**. (3) A bounded but consequential edge, resilience, observability, testability, maintainability, or architectural gap with credible impact? → **MEDIUM**. (4) Evidence shows only non-blocking polish? → **LOW**. (5) Evidence to choose among 1–4 missing → **NOT VERIFIABLE**, not LOW. When several tiers fit, select the highest credible consequence; effort, cost, reviewer discomfort, frequency alone, proximity to the round cap, and unlocking or forfeiting the round-3 extension never decide the tier.
>
> **Boundary examples:** auth bypass, exposed secret/PII, destructive command without an authority gate, or failed required test/generation/parity gate → **CRITICAL**; wrong supported response, broken invariant/API/schema, meaningful privacy/authority defect, or unproven behavior-changing fix → **HIGH**; bounded retry/timeout/alert/testability gap or credible maintainability drift → **MEDIUM**; typo, formatting, optional cleanup, or cosmetic suggestion proven not to affect behavior → **LOW**. A missing fact about any boundary is **NOT VERIFIABLE** until evidence or a documented residual-risk decision exists.
>
> **Classification procedure (every finding):** (1) state the affected user, system, data, contract, or gate; (2) assess consequence if it ships; (3) assess exposure/likelihood and reversibility/detectability; (4) select the highest justified tier; (5) cite `file:line` or equivalent evidence and a confidence percentage. `NOT VERIFIABLE` is a pending evidence state, not a fifth tier and never a LOW escape hatch: if the claim could affect required behavior, security, privacy, authority, availability, data integrity, or a binary gate, it stays an open evidence blocker until resolved or explicitly owner-accepted with documented residual risk. Classify LOW only when evidence supports the absence of credible present material impact.
>
> **Hard-gate rule:** Binary gates (tests, required artifacts, security must-fix checks, generated parity, policy compliance) are not severity-rated findings. The executable helper records a failed gate as a synthetic CRITICAL blocker so one predicate can carry it; the report still names the gate and failure evidence. A failed gate blocks at every round, even when all ordinary findings are LOW. A failed non-test gate counts as CRITICAL for the round-3 extension; a failing test gate is outside the round budget and loops until the tests pass.
>
> **Score-based skills** map their numeric scale onto these tiers — no parallel vocabulary:
>
> - **0-2 criterion scoring** (e.g. production-readiness-review): `0` = CRITICAL/HIGH (unmet, blocks readiness), `1` = MEDIUM (partial, consequential gap), `2` = pass. A polish-only criterion is LOW, not a forced `0`.
> - **Two-axis scoring** (e.g. performance-review, impact × likelihood): high impact + high exposure → CRITICAL/HIGH; material impact, bounded exposure → HIGH/MEDIUM; low impact and exposure → LOW. Record the axes and why the tier is the highest credible consequence.
> - **Scorecards / `/20` grades** (e.g. architecture-scalability-review): the aggregate score and verdict band are separate from finding severity. A sub-80 area is evidence to investigate, not an automatic tier; classify each underlying gap by the decision tree and keep advisory score deductions apart from blocking findings.
>
> **Domain-vocabulary normalization (mandatory):** a skill may keep a local reporting vocabulary, but it MUST feed this same four-tier round predicate — never a second severity system:
>
> - `BLOCKED`, `HARD FAIL`, or `FAIL` is a blocking local verdict, not an automatic CRITICAL: CRITICAL for an immediate material risk or failed binary gate, otherwise HIGH or MEDIUM with evidence, while the local block holds until the owning gate is satisfied.
> - `WARN` is not permission to ignore: MEDIUM when consequential, LOW only when evidence shows no credible present material impact, HIGH/CRITICAL when the consequence warrants. `PASS`/compliant is not a finding.
> - UI `P0`/`P1`/`P2`/`P3`/`P4` start as CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW/LOW; override upward only on evidence of a higher shipped consequence. A P0/P1 accessibility or task-completion floor stays a blocking gate even when called a priority.
> - Numeric SRE/readiness or impact/likelihood scores are evidence inputs, not tiers: emit the score, the consequence, and the normalized tier together. `INFO`/advisory observations are not findings unless evidence shows a material consequence.
>
> A tier drives the gate: CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM stay actionable and blocking under the round policy; only an open CRITICAL/HIGH at round 2 (a failed non-test binary gate counts as CRITICAL) unlocks the single conditional extension round; LOW may be tracked as a follow-up and, from round 2, never justifies another fix/re-review by itself. An owner decision may explain or schedule an open MEDIUM but never makes it a clean pass; owner acceptance never makes a failed binary gate pass and must record scope, rationale, and residual risk.

>
> 1. **Is there any trade-off?** Name what it SACRIFICES. "None" / "pure win" is an unfinished analysis, NOT an answer — to claim none, state which dimensions you checked and why each is unaffected: future change cost · complexity · performance/latency · memory/cost · coupling · reversibility · migration burden · operational load · blast radius · security posture · testability · team skill/ramp · delivery time · UX.
> 2. **Is it worth it?** Weigh gain against sacrifice EXPLICITLY — what is gained (with a metric) · what it costs · WHO pays · WHEN it comes due — then emit **WORTH IT / NOT WORTH IT / UNCLEAR**. "Better" with no metric and no cost FAILS this question. NOT WORTH IT → withdraw or replace the recommendation, never keep it as-is.
> 3. **Is the trade-off material enough to CONFIRM WITH THE USER?** A material trade-off is the user's call, never yours. **MATERIAL** when ANY holds: irreversible / one-way door (data migration, public contract, storage format, vendor lock-in) · cost shifted onto someone else (another team, ops/on-call, future maintainer, end user) · one quality attribute traded for another (correctness↔speed, security↔convenience, latency↔cost, simplicity↔flexibility) · a boundary crossed (client↔server tier, service contract, event contract, shared library) · a high-consequence path (auth, money, data integrity, breaking change, High/Medium residual risk) · the worth-it verdict is UNCLEAR.

>
> **Non-asking execution contexts — ESCALATE BY HANDOFF, never by silence.** ask the user directly reaches only the main interactive agent: a sub-agent cannot ask the user, and a terminal/verdict-only mode asks nothing by design. When you are running in such a context, the obligation is **redirected, never waived** — do ALL of: (a) complete questions 1 and 2 normally; (b) decide materiality and record it in the Trade-Off Assessment row with `confirmed? = NO — cannot ask from this context`; (c) **name the unconfirmed MATERIAL trade-off explicitly in your returned summary/verdict so the CALLER (or parent orchestrator) escalates it by asking the user directly on your behalf** — a material trade-off mentioned only inside a report file on disk is NOT a handoff; (d) do not emit an unqualified PASS — mark the verdict as carrying an unconfirmed material trade-off, so the caller's gate stays closed until the user answers. The caller inherits the escalation duty the moment it reads your return.

<!-- SYNC:domain-entity-change-gate -->

> **Domain Entity Change Gate** — ONE DDD-specific protocol binding every skill or agent that PLANS, IMPLEMENTS, or REVIEWS a change to a domain entity, value object, or aggregate in a model that uses DDD tactical patterns or an evidenced equivalent. First inspect the project's domain model and accepted architecture. If neither uses that model, record `DDD-specific gate N/A — project model: <evidence>`; still apply the project's normal ownership, invariant, assertion-backed test, and evidence rules. `$domain-entities-review` is the canonical owner of the full A–P checklist; this gate is the shared trigger plus the decisions that must be answered when applicable. NEVER re-derive a weaker local copy — why: when planning and review disagree on entity rules, the plan ships a design that review then rejects, and the rework is paid twice.
>
> **Trigger — after DDD applicability is established, fires when ANY holds:** a new entity / value object / aggregate root is introduced · an existing one gains or loses a field, invariant, relationship, or state transition · an aggregate boundary, repository, or cross-aggregate reference changes · a domain event is added, renamed, or re-payloaded · a concurrency or reconstitution concern on a root changes. State `No domain-entity surface — gate N/A` when none holds.
>
> **Step 1 — Detect BEFORE deciding.** Both answers change which rules even apply:
>
> - **Paradigm** (per aggregate, from the code — NEVER assumed): OO-mutable · type-driven/immutable · event-sourced. Setter, mutability, and reconstitution rules are written for OO-mutable; applying them to the other two manufactures false findings and false plan tasks.
> - **Subdomain fit:** core (rich model owed) · supporting (Active Record or light model) · generic (buy, do not model) · CRUD (Transaction Script — a rich entity here is ceremony). NEVER plan or flag a rich model where the subdomain has no invariant beyond required-field.
>
> **Step 2 — Answer all 6 decision points.** Each is a decision the change MUST make explicitly:
>
> | # | Decision point | Answered when |
> | - | -------------- | ------------- |
> | 1 | **Classification** — entity vs value object vs aggregate root | The swap test is applied ("would an identical copy be interchangeable?"); a VO is immutable with structural equality and has no repository |
> | 2 | **Invariant ownership** — entity owns "can this state exist?", the boundary owns "is this input acceptable?" | Each rule is placed on one side and named; failure signalling (throw vs `Result`) matches the project convention consistently; a DB constraint is a backstop, NEVER the rule |
> | 3 | **Aggregate boundary + concurrency** | Only true always-consistent invariants share an aggregate; cross-aggregate references are by ID; one aggregate mutates per transaction; the ROOT carries the concurrency token; set-based invariants (uniqueness across instances) name a real enforcing mechanism, never an in-memory check |
> | 4 | **Construction vs reconstitution** | Creation and load are separate paths; the load path raises NO domain events and re-runs NO creation rules; required data sits in the constructor/factory |
> | 5 | **Events** | Raised inside the aggregate; dispatched AFTER commit (outbox when crossing a process); internal domain events kept distinct from published integration contracts; handlers idempotent |
> | 6 | **Test obligation** | Every applicable invariant is named and protected by an executing assertion in the project's native test format, with property and boundary-countercase coverage where applicable; GWT is optional. A valid `specArtifacts` profile supplies case identity/carriers; use property TCs only when the profile is absent. A malformed declared profile blocks; a happy-path example alone is NOT coverage |
>
> **Step 3 — Apply by context.** Same decisions, different obligation:
>
> | Calling context | Obligation |
> | --------------- | ---------- |
> | **Planning** (`$plan`) | The plan MUST name the decision and the owning file for every triggered row. An unanswered row is a plan that is not executable — surface it, do NOT let implementation discover it. |
> | **Plan review** (`$plan-review`) | An unanswered, hand-waved, or deferred-to-implementation row is a FINDING with `file:line` into the plan. Presence of the word "entity" is NEVER an answer. |
> | **Implementation** (`$plan-execute`, `$fix`, and any implementing agent — e.g. `backend-developer`) | The decisions are INPUTS, not questions to reopen: implement each triggered row as the plan/spec decided it, at the owning file it named. A row that arrives UNANSWERED is a blocker — surface it and get it decided; NEVER settle it silently at the keyboard, and NEVER pick an aggregate boundary from a DB table or UI screen because the plan left it open.

<!-- SYNC:design-review-checklist -->

> **Front-End Design Review Checklist** — the EXECUTABLE review protocol for any artifact carrying a user-facing front-end surface. Full catalog (`A1`…`Q` plus §R, ~155 checks with failure signals and default severities; worked calibration cases in `.claude/docs/design-review-calibration.md`): **`.claude/docs/design-review-checklist.md`**. This gate carries the protocol and the triage pass; the file carries the checks.
>
> **Applies when — and ONLY when — the change, plan, or artifact carries a user-facing front-end surface.** A back-end-only diff, a doc edit, or a config change is `N/A`: state that once and move on. NEVER run a UI review on a non-UI change to manufacture coverage. When it DOES apply, **MUST ATTENTION READ `.claude/docs/design-review-checklist.md` and work its sections** — a review that cites a check ID without opening the catalog is asserting, not checking.
>
> **`CL-1` Context before checks (§0.1).** Establish platform · primary user & expertise · primary task · success metric · constraints · review scope · available artifacts. Fewer than four known → state the gap at the top of the report and mark affected findings **low confidence** — why: a check judged against an unknown task is a guess wearing an ID.
>
> **`CL-2` Evidence or nothing (§0.2).** Every finding cites a specific location (screen · element · `file:line`). NEVER invent a measurement — contrast, tap-target size, and load time that cannot be measured from the given artifact are `NOT VERIFIABLE`, never a guessed number. Tag every finding `MEASURED` · `OBSERVED` · `HEURISTIC`. Status values: `PASS` · `FAIL` · `PARTIAL` · `N/A` · `NOT VERIFIABLE`.
>
> **`CL-3` Severity, then a cap (§0.3).** `P0` blocks task completion / loses data / excludes a protected group (ship blocker) · `P1` significant friction or a legal accessibility floor (fix before release) · `P2` measurable inefficiency (next iteration) · `P3` polish (backlog) · `P4` note. Translate to other dialects (BLOCKED/WARN, Critical–Low, BLOCKING/ADVISORY) ONLY through the §0.3 severity map. Cap the report at the top 10 by severity unless a full audit was requested. A clean section reports "no issues found" — NEVER pad. Every `P0`/`P1` carries a concrete fix.
>
> **`CL-4` Section sweep, in order — over whole SURFACES, not files (§0.5).** Map changed files to the pages/views/dialogs they render into, reconstruct each surface's composition (component tree + style origins; render when it can run, else `ENVIRONMENT-BLOCKED`), then sweep: §A core usability heuristics · §B cognitive load & surface complexity (B12–B15: surface load, progressive disclosure, one job per view, the project's complexity budget) · §C visual design & hierarchy · §D interaction and relevant product states · §E information architecture & container fit (E9–E11: dialog vs full view vs stepped flow vs side panel vs inline) · **§F web / §G mobile — conditional on platform; §H expert & data-heavy use — conditional on usage, not platform** · §I accessibility: use WCAG 2.2 AA as the web baseline and meet any stricter applicable legal or project requirement; for other platforms, use the documented platform standard. Record the selected standard and its source; severity follows the governing release contract · §J content & UX writing · §K trust, ethics & privacy · **§L AI & agentic patterns — conditional on the product having AI features** · §M cross-cutting consistency · **§R forms & data entry — conditional on input: fill the Field Necessity Matrix first** · §N edge-case probes. Make one focused pass per applicable section and record N/A with evidence for sections the surface does not support. Cluster a defect repeated across surfaces into ONE finding; calibrate against `.claude/docs/design-review-calibration.md`.
>
> **`CL-5` Quick Triage Pass (§P)** when a full sweep is not possible — use these prompts for applicable surfaces: (1) can a new user complete the primary task unaided · (2) is feedback timely against the project/platform expectation · (3) do relevant empty/loading/error states offer a forward path · (4) is the primary action obvious and reachable for supported inputs · (5) do contrast and focus meet the selected accessibility standard (WCAG 2.2 AA baseline for web) · (6) can users operate the surface with its supported input modes · (7) do interactive targets meet the platform's size/spacing guidance · (8) are destructive actions recoverable where appropriate · (9) does the surface work at its smallest supported size and required zoom/reflow · (10) are there deceptive or coercive patterns.
>
> **`CL-6` Report shape (§O).** Context (+ known gaps) → Verdict (Ship / Ship with fixes / Do not ship) → What works (2–4 specific strengths, cited) → Findings grouped `P0`→`P3`, each with Location · Evidence + tag · Impact · Principle (checklist ID) · Fix → Open questions → Coverage table. Any `P0` caps the grade at Fail regardless of score; report a score only ALONGSIDE findings, never instead of them.
>
> **Component architecture pass (§M6–§M9) when source code is in scope.** Verify the ownership model documented or demonstrated by the project, reuse/composition decisions, and whether shared behavior is duplicated without a reason. Do not require tiers, a base abstraction, or a particular test hierarchy unless the project uses one. Report applicable checklist IDs with `file:line` evidence; do not infer source architecture from a screenshot alone.
>
> **Precedence and no-double-counting.** The project's design-system / SCSS / frontend-pattern docs and accepted ADRs OUTRANK this checklist; the brief's stated direction outranks aesthetic judgment. A deliberate, documented convention is NEVER a defect — check intent before flagging, and surface a genuine conflict to the user with both sides, NEVER resolve it silently. This checklist is the review PROCEDURE, not a third set of taste rules: `UI-1.1`–`UI-9.4` ask "does it meet the usability floor?", `DD-1`–`DD-8` ask "is this THIS product's interface?", and these checks ask "did the review actually look, with evidence, and rank it?". Where a check restates a `UI-*` or `DD-*` clause, report the defect ONCE under whichever ID the consuming skill already uses.
>
> **For a PLAN or a PLAN REVIEW.** When the plan contains UI work, bind applicable acceptance criteria to the target platform/surface, relevant user states, and the selected accessibility standard. Each UI phase MUST name, per new or reshaped view: its primary task, its container (E9), its information priority (what is shown now / later / never here), and — for input — the inputs required at creation vs deferred (§R1–R2). A plan review treats a UI phase missing these as a finding against the checklist IDs it leaves unbound. Use WCAG 2.2 AA as the web baseline and meet any stricter applicable legal or project requirement; for other platforms, identify the documented platform standard. Identify conditional sections (§F/§G/§H, §L) that apply. Do not require every catalogued state; record the standard and its source, and keep unsupported checks N/A.

<!-- /SYNC:design-review-checklist -->

<!-- SYNC:parallel-subagent-dispatch -->

> **Parallel Sub-Agent Dispatch** — Plan parallelism the moment a task breakdown exists, BEFORE executing it — serial execution of provably independent tasks wastes wall-clock. Applies to every multi-step job (workflow steps, planning, batch updates, investigation, research, scans, reviews, doc sync). **Plan execution is metadata-gated, NEVER default-parallel** — fan-out follows ONLY what the plan declares (`PAR`/`SEQ` tags + per-phase write set); an untagged plan runs sequentially — why: a derived write set cannot see cascade or generated writes.
>
> 1. **Tag every task `PAR` or `SEQ`.** `PAR` = inputs exclude every pending task's output AND write set disjoint from every other `PAR`; else `SEQ`, naming the dependency that forces it.
> 2. **Group `PAR` into waves.** No edge between members; two writers of one file NEVER share a wave; read-only work parallelizes freely.
> 3. **Declare before dispatch:** `Parallel plan: wave 1 = [...] · wave 2 = [...] · SEQ = [...] (reason)`.
> 4. **Spawn each wave in ONE message** — every `spawn_agent` call in one response, NEVER dripped per turn. Route each task to its specialist (`.claude/skills/shared/sub-agent-selection-guide.md`); NEVER `code-reviewer` as catch-all.
> 5. **Brief each sub-agent self-contained:** goal · scope + owned files · reference docs · return contract (summary + `Full report:` path, per SYNC:subagent-return-contract) · incremental persistence to `tmp/reports/` (per SYNC:incremental-persistence).
> 6. **Barrier per wave.** Advance ONLY after EVERY member returns (a skipped conditional counts as returned). Merge, mark each task completed/skipped, THEN dispatch the next wave. Mutating steps wait for the barrier.
> 7. **One level deep.** A dispatched sub-agent executes its own brief; further fan-out stays the orchestrator's job unless that agent's `.claude/agents/*.md` definition authorizes it.
>
> **NEVER parallelize:** tasks sharing a write target · a task consuming a pending task's output · trivial single-file work (dispatch overhead > gain) · an order a skill or workflow explicitly fixes · gates awaiting user approval.
>
> **Blocked until:** MUST ATTENTION every task tagged PAR/SEQ with a named reason per SEQ · waves declared + write-set disjointness checked · each wave spawned in ONE message · barrier honored before the next wave.

<!-- SYNC:project-protocol-overlay -->

> **Project Protocol Overlay** — Before executing this skill, resolve project overlays from the index at `<docsRoots.projectReference.path>/skill-protocols-reference.md` (default `docs/project-reference/`; `docsRoots.projectReference.path` in `docs/project-config.json` overrides it). A matching `referenceDocs[]` filename may relocate the index within that root; this registry is independent from task-specific reference-doc selection, so omitted or empty `referenceDocs` does not disable it. The index's `**Protocols directory:**` header selects a project-root-relative body directory (default `docs/project-protocols/`). Match this skill against the `Target` column and take the most specific tier ONLY — exact name > glob > `*`. **That precedence orders overlays against EACH OTHER, never against this skill.** Read only matched bodies derived as `<protocols-dir>/<Name>.md`; the row's Body link is display text, never a read path. Reject unsafe paths without reading. A matched body that is missing or malformed is REPORTED and skipped — never reconstructed from the index Description. An absent index or no match -> proceed with no overlay, silently. Full contract: `.claude/skills/project-skill-protocol/references/registry.md`.
>
> Overlays are **ADDITIVE ONLY**: they ADD rules on top of this skill's own protocol and NEVER replace, override, disable, or reinterpret a rule it already states — removing every overlay must return this skill to exactly its documented behavior. An overlay is a BRIEF, not an authority escalation: it can NEVER waive a workflow gate, git discipline, a review gate, or a user-confirmation gate. A genuine overlay-vs-skill conflict, or two equally-specific overlays that directly contradict -> surface both to the user; NEVER resolve silently.

<!-- SYNC:domain-entity-change-gate:reminder -->

**MUST ATTENTION** when a changed model uses DDD tactical patterns or an evidenced equivalent, apply the **Domain Entity Change Gate** — `$domain-entities-review` owns the full A–P checklist; detect paradigm + subdomain fit FIRST, then answer all 6 applicable decisions (classification · invariant ownership + failure signalling · aggregate boundary + concurrency · construction vs reconstitution · events · assertion-backed native test obligation). Use property TCs only under the absent-profile default; a malformed declared `specArtifacts` profile blocks without fallback. When the project does not use this model, record the DDD-specific gate N/A and still protect actual invariants and outcomes through the configured owner. Planning must NAME each applicable decision; plan review treats an unanswered row as a FINDING; change review routes to the owner (Mode A read / Mode B delegate). SKIP under the 3-row duplication guard and record the deferral line. — why: one protocol shared by planner and reviewer is what stops a plan shipping an entity design that review then rejects.

<!-- SYNC:task-tracking-external-report:reminder -->

- **MANDATORY** Bootstrap task tracking before target work; transition one task at a time.
- **MANDATORY** Persist plan/review findings to `tmp/reports/` incrementally and synthesize from disk.

<!-- /SYNC:task-tracking-external-report:reminder -->

<!-- SYNC:project-reference-docs-guide:reminder -->

- **MANDATORY** Project config is OPTIONAL (default `docs/project-config.json`, via its loader): absent → portable defaults plus repository evidence, state material assumptions, never block; present → non-empty `project.name`, neutral defaults for omitted capabilities, fail closed on a declared malformed section.
- **MANDATORY** An explicit `referenceDocs` array is exact, including `[]`; absent → only the capability-aware resolver output, which may be empty. `lessons.md` and docs-index are always-on, outside that selection. A missing/stale required input or malformed declared section → `$project-init` or the narrow owner route before relying on it.
- **MANDATORY** Pick docs by the phase you are about to enter — plan/investigate, edit code, tests, specs/docs, review — from the gate's routing table, JUST IN TIME before the first target read/grep/edit/test, plus the file's `contextGroups[]` conventions before editing it; cite `Reference docs read: ...`.
- **MANDATORY** Dedup: skip a re-read only for your own full read after the last compaction, within ~200K tokens, unchanged since — a hook reminder, summary, or prior mention is NEVER evidence; re-read after compaction or resume, and give delegated sub-agents the resolved doc paths. Project config and conventions override generic framework defaults.

<!-- SYNC:end-to-start-debugger-trace:reminder -->

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** debugger trace gate: for non-trivial bug/fix/investigation/review work, start at the observed final output and trace backward through reader -> storage/projection -> writer -> consumer/job -> producer/trigger. Enumerate all feeder paths and hypotheses before fixing; select the authoritative invariant owner from project architecture and retain validation at untrusted boundaries. **BLOCKED until** trace, hypothesis matrix, owning fix layer, and forward convergence proof exist.

<!-- /SYNC:end-to-start-debugger-trace:reminder -->

<!-- SYNC:nested-task-creation:reminder -->

- **MANDATORY** Parent workflow rows do not replace child phase tracking; expand phases and link the parent when nested.
- **MANDATORY** Orchestrators pre-expand child skill phases before invocation; use `[N.M] /skill-name — phase` prefixes and one-`in_progress` discipline.

<!-- /SYNC:nested-task-creation:reminder -->

<!-- SYNC:goal-contract-satisfaction-loop:reminder -->

- **MANDATORY** Resolve the active Goal Contract BEFORE work (active plan `goal.md` → `<plans root>/goals/{YYMMDD-HHmm}-{slug}/goal.md`, plans root default `plans` and overridable via a `docsRoots.plans.path` entry in `docs/project-config.json` → create from current request) and read saved success criteria before editing.
- **MANDATORY** Append iteration evidence after execution; emit a Goal Satisfaction matrix (PASS/FAIL/BLOCKED) before reporting PASS; loop on validated FAIL; escalate repeated no-progress or blockers. NEVER store secrets in goal files.

<!-- /SYNC:goal-contract-satisfaction-loop:reminder -->

<!-- SYNC:systematic-review-batching:reminder -->

- **MANDATORY** Large changeset → batch by size cap (≤8 files OR ≤2000 diff-lines), one parallel sub-agent per batch; never review many files one-by-one.
- **MANDATORY** > 6 categories OR > 40 files → add the hierarchical synthesis tier; each concern-synthesizer emits cross-concern interaction candidates and the orchestrator runs the cross-concern pass before concluding.

<!-- /SYNC:systematic-review-batching:reminder -->

<!-- SYNC:severity-rubric:reminder -->

- **MANDATORY** Classify every finding Critical/High/Medium/Low by consequence using the affected asset, shipped impact, exposure, reversibility, evidence location, and confidence; Critical/High/MEDIUM remain actionable under the round bar, while LOW is recorded/deferred from round 2 onward.
- **MANDATORY** Keep binary gates separate from severity: a failed test, security must-fix, required artifact, or parity check blocks at every round and is never relabeled LOW.
- **MANDATORY** Score-based skills (sre 0-2, perf two-axis) map onto the same four tiers — no parallel severity vocabulary.

<!-- /SYNC:severity-rubric:reminder -->

<!-- SYNC:category-review-thinking:reminder -->

- **MANDATORY** Derive review categories from file language + directory semantics + change nature; create a sub-task per category.
- **MANDATORY** Derive each category's concerns from first principles with `file:line` evidence — never a fixed checklist.

<!-- /SYNC:category-review-thinking:reminder -->

<!-- SYNC:double-round-trip-review:reminder -->

- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** run the review loop (aka **Self-Review Convergence Loop**): review → validate findings → fix validated blocking findings → FULL re-review. Any newly produced output/judgment gets ≥1 self-review, and any new judgment ≥1 `$why-review --validate-findings` pass, before it is treated as final.
- **MANDATORY severity floor:** round 1 exits only on zero findings at any severity; from round 2 the bar is zero CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM, so a LOW-only round ENDS the loop once the persisted `minRounds` is met — list every deferred LOW in the report. NEVER re-tier a real CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM down to reach the exit, and NEVER apply the floor to a binary gate (test-green, security must-fix).
- **MANDATORY round cap of 2, extendable ONCE to round 3 — a ceiling, NEVER a target.** A clean pass ends the loop once the persisted `minRounds` is met (default 1; explicit 2 requires an independent pass). Round 2 ending with a validated CRITICAL/HIGH still open (a failed non-test binary gate counts as CRITICAL) grants exactly ONE extra round; round 2 ending with only MEDIUM/`NOT VERIFIABLE` open, or round 3 ending with any review blocker open → **STOP and escalate by asking the user directly**, never a silent PASS. The 2-repeated-no-progress blocker rule escalates earlier if it trips first. A failing TEST gate has NO round cap and buys no extension — keep fixing and re-running until tests pass, never forcing green.

<!-- /SYNC:double-round-trip-review:reminder -->

<!-- SYNC:trade-off-interrogation-gate:reminder -->

- **MANDATORY MUST ATTENTION ALWAYS ASK THE 3 TRADE-OFF QUESTIONS** — on the thing under review AND on every recommendation you make: (1) **what does it SACRIFICE?** name the dimensions checked (change cost · complexity · perf · coupling · reversibility · migration · ops load · blast radius · security · testability · delivery time · UX) — "none"/"pure win" is an unfinished analysis; (2) **is it worth it?** gain (with a metric) vs cost, WHO pays, WHEN → emit **WORTH IT / NOT WORTH IT / UNCLEAR**; NOT WORTH IT → withdraw or replace it; (3) **is it MATERIAL enough to confirm with the user?** irreversible/one-way door · cost shifted onto another team/ops/maintainer/user · one quality attribute traded for another · a tier/service/event/library boundary crossed · auth/money/data-integrity/breaking-change/High-or-Medium-risk path · verdict UNCLEAR → **STOP and confirm by asking the user directly BEFORE the verdict**.
- **MANDATORY** A MATERIAL trade-off with no user confirmation can NEVER be PASS; never bury one as a Low-severity note, never decide it silently, and never let delivery or convergence pressure authorize a one-way door — an un-walked-back one-way door is the user's call, not the reviewer's.
- **MANDATORY — a context that cannot ask escalates BY HANDOFF, never by silence.** ask the user directly reaches only the main interactive agent, so a sub-agent or a terminal/verdict-only mode cannot ask. There the duty is REDIRECTED, not waived: still name the trade-off, still decide materiality, record `confirmed? = NO — cannot ask from this context`, and **state the unconfirmed MATERIAL trade-off in your RETURNED verdict so the CALLER escalates it** (a note only in an on-disk report is not a handoff); never emit an unqualified PASS. If you CAN ask, you MUST ask.

<!-- /SYNC:trade-off-interrogation-gate:reminder -->

<!-- SYNC:parallel-subagent-dispatch:reminder -->

- **MANDATORY** After planning tasks, tag each PAR/SEQ and spawn every PAR wave as parallel sub-agents in ONE message — default parallel for workflows, batch updates, investigation, research, reviews; plan execution fans out ONLY on what the plan declares.
- **MANDATORY** Disjoint write sets per wave · all-return barrier before the next wave · specialist routing · sub-agents NEVER fan out further unless their own agent definition authorizes it.

<!-- /SYNC:parallel-subagent-dispatch:reminder -->

<!-- SYNC:project-protocol-overlay:reminder -->

**MUST ATTENTION** resolve this skill's overlays from the index at `<docsRoots.projectReference.path>/skill-protocols-reference.md` (default `docs/project-reference/`; overridable in `docs/project-config.json`); an empty task `referenceDocs` does NOT disable this lookup. Read ONLY matched bodies from the directory the index header names (default `docs/project-protocols/`). Specificity (exact > glob > `*`) ranks overlays against EACH OTHER, never against the skill. Missing/malformed body → report and skip; no index or no match → proceed silently. Overlays are ADDITIVE ONLY — never an authority escalation or a gate waiver; equal-tier contradiction goes to the user.

<!-- /SYNC:project-protocol-overlay:reminder -->

<!-- SYNC:design-review-checklist:reminder -->

- **MUST ATTENTION** when the change/plan/artifact has an applicable user-facing UI surface, READ `.claude/docs/design-review-checklist.md` and run it: `CL-1` establish context first (platform · user · task · metric · constraints · scope · artifacts — state missing context and its confidence impact) · `CL-2` evidence or nothing, cite a location per finding, NEVER invent a measurement (unmeasurable → `NOT VERIFIABLE`), tag `MEASURED`/`OBSERVED`/`HEURISTIC` · `CL-3` rank `P0`–`P4`, cap at top 10 by severity, NEVER pad, concrete fix on every `P0`/`P1` · `CL-4` sweep §A–§N plus §R over whole surfaces (changed files → affected views, composition reconstructed, render or `ENVIRONMENT-BLOCKED`), including surface load B12–B15, container fit E9–E11, §H by usage, Field Necessity Matrix for input, applying only relevant platform/product sections and the WCAG 2.2 AA web baseline plus any stricter applicable legal/project requirement, or the documented standard for other platforms · `CL-5` short on time → use the §P prompts · `CL-6` report in the §O shape · for source code, assess component ownership, base abstractions, reuse, and duplication using the project's documented taxonomy or observed boundaries. Project design-system docs and ADRs OUTRANK the checklist; report a defect ONCE across `UI-*`/`DD-*`/`CL-*`. For a plan, bind only applicable sections and states to acceptance criteria, and name each UI view's primary task, container, information priority, and creation-vs-deferred inputs; a plan review flags a UI phase that omits them. Skip when the work has no user-facing UI surface, and state why.

Do not invent findings from a generic checklist, flag unrelated pre-existing gaps as regressions, silently expand the requested scope, or mutate a parent gate merely because advice exists.

> **Ownership:** `changes-review` coordinates the applicability pass and routes depth to the owning specialist (`architecture-review`, `integration-test-review`, `security-review`, `performance-review`, `ui-review`, `production-readiness-review`, or another matching review). A specialist reports its own lens and does not duplicate or override another review's verdict; existing brownfield gaps stay advisory unless new, safety-relevant, or explicitly in scope.
>
> **Required review note:** `context/scope | principle/protocol checked | evidence | status/verdict | severity | owner/route | next step/revisit trigger`.
>
> **BLOCKED when:** an applicable principle is required for safety/correctness but missing, unowned, or untestable. Otherwise record an evidence-backed `NOT-APPLICABLE`, advisory, `DEFER-AS-OPPORTUNITY`, or `UNVERIFIED` result according to the lifecycle and change context; creating a greenfield foundation remains subject to its own blocking protocol.

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** Every review first checks the change context and routes only applicable principles to their detailed protocols: scale-ready foundation, test intent in the project's native format (GWT is one option), AI-agent-as-user access, and UI/component design when relevant. Record evidence-backed apply/adapt/defer/N/A/block/unverified status with owner and next step; do not invent unrelated findings or expand scope.

## Closing Reminders

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION Goal:** review any change — one line or thousands of files — with depth where the risk is: triage first, evidence for every finding, validate before fixing, SELF-FIX the validated blocking findings (standalone), re-review the whole updated diff, and finish with `$docs-update` (round 1: zero findings; round 2: zero CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM, LOWs deferred).

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** Phase 0 triage (size band · change kinds · risk · blast radius) and the Review Plan with its coverage ledger come BEFORE any review work; every changed file is owned by a dimension or batch, and every ruled-out dimension carries its evidence.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** you choose the orchestration — XS/S inline, M one parallel wave, L/XL size-capped batches plus a synthesis pass — but never sample silently and never skip a required gate.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** ANY finding in standalone mode (Critical / High / Medium / OR Low) → invoke the `$why-review` skill via the skill invocation with `--validate-findings <report-path>` BEFORE any fix, docs-update, commit, or handoff — an actual skill call, never inline self-validation.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** after a fix, re-review the WHOLE current diff from Phase 0 with a fresh task list — never only the fixed files; run Phase 7.5 when any fix landed and Phase 8 `$docs-update` always (standalone).
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** every behavior-changing file gets a Spec Drift verdict and every behavior-changing finding a Dual-Feedback Ledger row (spec AND test); missing tests and missing translations surface by asking the user directly.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** specialists run `--report-only`; integrate their findings RAW — never filter, soften or override them.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** one task per selected dimension/batch and per required gate; the living report is written first and appended per file/batch — re-read it and the current task list after any compaction.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** every claim needs `file:line` proof and a confidence (>80% act, 60–80% verify first, <60% do not recommend); grep 3+ examples before flagging a convention.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION `--fix-loop` mode (optional, standalone-only; no flag → default unchanged):** (0) resolve the fixed diff scope + Goal Contract and plan the loop tasks → (0b) bind the convergence loop (protocol loop primary + optional `/goal` accelerator) → (1) round loop: report-only review pass INLINE (Phase 0 → Phase 5, fresh task list, stop before Phase 6) → `$why-review --validate-findings` → `$fix` on VALIDATED blocking findings at the owning layer → append Iteration Log → (2) converge when a FRESH full review pass over the post-fix diff clears the current round's bar (round 1: zero validated findings; round 2: zero validated CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM, LOW deferred) with the working-tree-unchanged backstop / escalate on non-progress → (3) terminal Phase 8 `$docs-update` + recap; never commit or push unless asked. **Mode scope:** this standalone mode pairs ONE review pass with `$fix` on the validated findings; it is DISTINCT from `$workflow-review-changes --fix-loop`, which re-runs the WHOLE default workflow until a round applies zero fixes. The mode's full text is `references/fix-loop.md` — read it FIRST (BLOCKING) whenever the flag is present.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** in `--fix-loop`, run the review pass and `$why-review` INLINE — NEVER as a sub-agent, NEVER re-invoke this skill with `--fix-loop` — regenerate a fresh loop task plan every round, apply ONLY validated findings, and keep the diff base fixed (`{scope}` = branch-diff base ∪ current uncommitted changes, recomputed each round).
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** enforce the **round cap (default 2, extendable ONCE to round 3 when round 2 leaves a validated CRITICAL/HIGH open)** in `--fix-loop`; review blockers not shrinking across 2 rounds or increasing (checked only after the round-2 CRITICAL/HIGH extension, which is granted first), or the budget spent with blocking findings still open → **STOP & escalate** by asking the user directly. NEVER loop past round 3 on review blockers, or open-ended — only failing test gates continue, until green; round-2 LOW-only findings converge and are recorded as deferred.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** when Phase 0.7 finds executable E2E/browser/user-flow artifacts, read `.claude/skills/shared/e2e-quality-protocol.md` and invoke `$e2e-test-verify` report-only in Phase 3.9; when no trigger exists, record `NOT-APPLICABLE` and do not run an E2E lane — why: optional routing preserves review cost while preventing unverified user-flow changes from hiding inside a generic code review.

**Anti-Rationalization:**

| Evasion | Rebuttal |
| --- | --- |
| "Tiny diff, skip triage" | Triage on an XS diff takes a minute and is what licenses the lean path; a 2-file auth change still escalates to `$security-review`. |
| "Big diff, run every specialist on everything" | Triage decides — spend specialist depth where the risk is, batch the rest, and verify mechanical churn by pattern. |
| "Too many files, sample a few" | Never sample silently — every changed file is in the coverage ledger, reviewed or classified with evidence. |
| "Finding is obvious, fix now" | Invoke `$why-review --validate-findings` first — unvalidated findings are not fixes. |
| "Only re-check the fixed files" | Fixes interact with earlier changes — re-review the whole current diff. |
| "Tests are green, the spec drift is fine" | Green can encode the drift — adjudicate every divergence. |
| "Clean review, docs surely fine" | Clean code ≠ current docs — Phase 8 `$docs-update` always runs (standalone). |
| "Sub-agent already reviewed it" | Integrate its findings raw; the main agent never overrides them. |

**[TASK-PLANNING]** Break scope into small todo tasks before acting; maintain one `in_progress`; add a final review todo.

> **AI-SDD Artifact Contract** — Shared spec-driven development rules stay portable and source-owned.
>
> 1. Keep reusable AI-SDD principles in `.claude`; put repository-specific paths, commands, owners, products, and formats in project config/reference docs.
> 2. Preserve cycle: `spec -> plan -> tasks -> implement -> verify -> update spec/docs`.
> 3. Resolve `specArtifacts` before selecting identity or carrier: use a valid profile, use strict-default TC/test identity only when the profile is absent, and block a malformed or unsupported declaration. Trace every requirement or invariant through decision, task, configured case/test identity and inspected assertion evidence, then carry it through source evidence and canonical docs/spec updates.
> 4. Treat code-to-spec extraction as reference-only until accepted by the canonical spec owner.
> 5. Any supported AI tool may plan, implement, review, or verify with synced context; using multiple tools is optional.
> 6. Update `.claude` source first, then sync generated mirrors; do not manually edit `.agents`, `.codex`, or `AGENTS.md`. — why: mirrors are generated artifacts; hand-edits are overwritten on the next sync
> 7. If `docs/project-config.json`, root instruction files, or a required project-reference doc is missing or stale, auto-run `$project-init` or the narrow lower-level route before ordinary project-specific work.

## SYNC:ai-sdd-artifact-contract:reminder

- **MANDATORY** Apply `shared/sdd-artifact-contract.md`; keep reusable AI-SDD in `.claude` and local rules in project docs.
- **MANDATORY** Resolve and validate `specArtifacts`: use valid native owner/case/variant identity and assertion-bearing evidence; use strict-default TC/TestSpec only when the profile is absent; block a malformed or unsupported declaration without fallback.
- **MANDATORY** Code-to-spec extraction is reference-only until canonical acceptance; any supported AI tool may execute with synced context.
- **MANDATORY** Update `.claude` source before syncing generated mirrors; do not manually edit `.agents`, `.codex`, or `AGENTS.md`.
- **MANDATORY** Missing or stale project config, root instruction files, or required reference docs route project-specific work through `$project-init` or the narrow setup route automatically.
**[TASK-PLANNING] [MANDATORY]** BEFORE executing any workflow or skill step, create/update task tracking for all planned steps, analyze the task graph (output dependencies, shared write targets) into ordered parallel waves per PARALLELIZE before starting any task, then keep it synchronized as each step starts/completes. Preserve fixed ordering when a skill or workflow explicitly fixes it.
- **MANDATORY** Pin `Original goal:` before the first action and keep `User prompts this session: P1…Pn` current; re-read both at every step, before delegation, and after compaction.
- **MANDATORY** Before claiming done, map the result to the original goal and every prompt (`P# → done | deferred | n/a`); never store secrets in them.
## [LESSON-LEARNED-REMINDER] [BLOCKING] Task Planning & Continuous Improvement — MANDATORY. Do not skip.

Break work into small tasks (task tracking) before starting. Add final task: "Analyze AI mistakes & lessons learned".

**Extract lessons — ROOT CAUSE ONLY, not symptom fixes:**
1. Name the FAILURE MODE (reasoning/assumption failure), not symptom — "assumed API existed without reading source" not "used wrong enum value".
2. Generality test: does this failure mode apply to ≥3 contexts/codebases? If not, abstract one level up.
3. Write as a universal rule — strip project-specific names/paths/classes. Useful on any codebase.
4. Consolidate: multiple mistakes sharing one failure mode → ONE lesson.
5. **Recurrence gate:** "Would this recur in future session WITHOUT this reminder?" — No → skip `$learn`.
6. **Auto-fix gate:** "Could `$code-review`/`$code-simplifier`/`$security-review`/a linter catch this?" — Yes → improve review skill instead.
7. BOTH gates pass → ask user to run `$learn`.
**[CRITICAL-THINKING-MINDSET]** Apply critical thinking, sequential thinking. Every claim needs traced proof, confidence >80% to act.
**Anti-hallucination principle:** Never present guess as fact — cite sources for every claim, admit uncertainty freely, self-check output for errors, cross-reference independently, stay skeptical of own confidence — certainty without evidence root of all hallucination.
**AI Attention principle (Primacy-Recency):** Put the 3 most critical rules at both top and bottom of long prompts/protocols so instruction adherence survives long context windows.
**Goal-driven execution:** Define success criteria first, loop until verified, and stop only when observable checks pass.
**Tests verify intent:** Tests must protect business rules/invariants and fail when the protected intent breaks, not only mirror current behavior.
**Judgement integrity:** For theory checks, judgements, evaluations and gap hunts, the prompt's premise is a hypothesis — test it AND its opposite with one evidence bar (web-verify external facts), why-review the draft as an inline self-check (run the `why-review` skill only for a formal review/audit/gap-hunt deliverable or a MEDIUM+/consequential issue the inline pass cannot settle), never invent findings or manufacture disagreement ("no material issues" is a valid verdict); end with a `Bias check:` line (`SYNC:judgement-integrity`).
## Common AI Mistake Prevention (System Lessons)

- **Resolve project applicability before using framework examples.** Read the project config and relevant references, then inspect local evidence; honor explicit N/A and never impose a language, framework, architecture layer, styling method, tool, or runtime surface the project does not use.
- **ROOT-CAUSE GATE — INVESTIGATE FIRST.** Before applying any project-related correction, always use the project's root-cause investigation protocol and establish the cause; the failure site may be only a symptom.
- **FAILED-TEST GATE.** For any failed or unstable test, use the project's test-investigation protocol before editing source or tests; never change either side merely to force green.
- **Re-read and re-verify after context compaction or resume.** Compaction wipes read state and memory; summaries describe intent, not environment state. Re-read before editing, audit current state (git status, files) before creating anything new, grep-verify sub-agent output — every "completed" claim is a hypothesis until evidence confirms it.
- **Verify AI-generated content against actual code.** AI hallucinates APIs, class names, method signatures. Grep to confirm existence before documenting/referencing.
- **Trace every consumer before and after a change.** Map referencing files before deleting; after bulk replacements, renames, or extractions, grep ALL consumer file types (templates, configs, catalogs and generated files fail silently) for every old or removed name; trace the full dependency chain of an edited definition; update docs that embed canonical data alongside their source.
- **Trace ALL code paths when verifying correctness.** Code existing ≠ code executing. Trace early exits, error branches, conditional skips — not just happy path.
- **Sub-agents: inherit, cover, persist.** Sub-agents know only their agent .md definition — use custom agent types, not built-in Explore. Reconcile the union of assignments against the full target list — category splits miss boundary items. Make the report write the first deliverable, appended per file/section with bounded scope; a truncated run with no report → spawn a narrower scope, never the same prompt.
- **Ownership before action.** When investigating a failure, ask which part owns the behavior before changing anything. Trace the wrong state to the component responsible for its invariant, then make one authoritative correction there.
- **Test failure → record a provisional verdict before trace/edit, then investigate.** Use the full five-way taxonomy: SOURCE-WRONG (production violates intent), TEST-WRONG (assertion/setup is stale), TEST-NOT-OPTIMAL (valid but fragile or low-signal test), ENVIRONMENT-BLOCKED (external state prevents a verdict), or AMBIGUOUS (intent/evidence cannot choose safely). Then trace root cause and triangulate against the governing spec if one exists (the business spec root — default `docs/specs`; a `specRoots.business.path` entry in `docs/project-config.json` overrides the path) AND source. NEVER weaken an assertion, add a skip, relax a timeout, or change source merely to force green.
- **Assume existing values are intentional — ask WHY before changing OR flagging one as a defect.** Before changing or reporting any constant/limit/flag/cutoff, read comments, git blame, the CALLER's ordering (the guarantee usually runs immediately BEFORE the cited line), and 2+ sibling call sites. A doc stating WHAT without WHY is missing rationale, not proof of a missing guard — and an accurate `file:line` citation proves the transcription, never the defect.
- **Verify ALL affected outputs, not just the first.** One build green ≠ all green. Multi-stack changes (backend/frontend/tests/docs) require verifying EVERY output.
- **Evaluate fit before copying a nearby pattern.** Closest example ≠ matching preconditions — verify the new context shares the same constraints, base classes, scope, lifetime.
- **Holistic analysis — resist the nearest-attention trap.** Do not dive into the first plausible cause. List every precondition (configuration, environment, inputs, dependencies, versions, permissions, state) and verify each against evidence. Ask "what would falsify this?" — if nothing, it is not a hypothesis.
- **Minimal changes — apply the relevance test.** Every change must trace to the reported problem: "Would this change exist if I were not addressing this request?" — if not, remove or disclose it; never silently expand scope.
- **Surface ambiguity before coding — don't pick silently.** Multiple valid interpretations → present each with effort ("(1) [N h], (2) [N h]. Which matters?"), list assumptions, name a simpler path when one exists.
- **Why-Review adversarial mindset — apply when reviewing any plan, decision, or design.** Default SKEPTIC: steel-man a rejected alternative, invert each reason ("what does it sacrifice?"), stress-test the top 2-3 assumptions, run a pre-mortem. Quality = causal reasoning + mitigations + evidence, not section presence.
- **OOM/memory: check row count before row size.** An unbounded query (no DB filter for the trigger) → push the filter to the DB; then large rows → projection. Row reduction > projection in ROI.
- **Assert the outcome your system OWNS, never the intermediate state your INFRASTRUCTURE owns.** For async work (queues, retries, background jobs, caches, replication) assert the final business/entity state — NEVER delivery bookkeeping (consume/send status, attempt counts, last-error, broker/scheduler/outbox rows) that ANY co-running process can write: green alone, flaky once anything shares that broker + database. Gate: "would this hold no matter WHICH process did the work?" Process-local fault injection is a stress amplifier (arm → bounded window → disarm → assert convergence), never a precondition.
- **Store disposable generated output in the project workspace.** If an output can be regenerated and is not source code, a canonical source-of-truth, or an intentionally versioned projection, write it under the project-root `tmp/` or `temp/` directory (prefer `tmp/`), scoped to the run. This includes temporary state, integration/E2E results, reports, logs, screenshots, traces, videos, coverage, dumps, and candidate evidence. Never put these outputs in source, docs, the plans root (default `plans/`; a `docsRoots.plans.path` entry in `docs/project-config.json` overrides the path), the team-artifacts root (default `team-artifacts/`; `docsRoots.teamArtifacts.path` in the same config overrides the path), or mirror directories; the project-root `.gitignore` must ignore `/tmp/` and `/temp/` by default. Committed fixtures, accepted baselines, canonical specs/docs, and explicitly versioned generated mirrors remain at their declared owner paths.
- **Judge the environment before judging the code — a competing hypothesis, not a fallback.** A bug, failed test, error, or odd output is NOT proof of a code defect. Before any verdict, sweep environment preconditions (toolchain/lockfile state, stale build/cache artifacts, env vars and config, service dependencies, ports/clock, OS path/locale, permissions, leftover processes/test data) AND transient resource pressure (RAM/OOM, CPU, disk/temp, handle and connection-pool limits, network, a timeout that is really slowness). Tell-tale: non-deterministic, fails only in parallel, on one machine or only on CI, or an error naming resources. Cite the discriminator you ran (clean environment? path changed? concurrency 1?) — a verdict without one is a guess. Fix an environment cause in the environment; NEVER edit product code or weaken/skip a test to absorb it; a failure that vanishes on retry stays unexplained until its mechanism is named.
- **Cross-platform execution is a required contract.** Before authoring or changing a tool, script, process launcher, path assertion, or filesystem test, name the supported Windows, macOS, and Linux behaviors. Use platform-neutral APIs and literal argv vectors; never infer shell, temp-path, executable-extension, ACL, or symlink semantics from the current host. A documented command gives its Windows, macOS, and Linux form (Python: `py -3` on Windows, `python3` on macOS/Linux; shell: PowerShell/`.cmd` beside POSIX `sh`) or one platform-neutral runner such as `node <script>`. Canonicalize existing paths before identity, hashing, or equality checks; test native Windows and POSIX seams when behavior differs; keep CI platform matrices authoritative. Preserve fail-closed security boundaries — repair the fixture or platform branch, never weaken the guard just to make one OS green.
- **Keep domain concepts out of generic/shared/infrastructure layers.** A reusable layer must reference NO consumer-specific domain concept (tenant/customer/product IDs, business entities, feature rules); such a leak compiles, runs, and passes review while coupling the layer to one consumer. Push domain fields/logic down into the consumer via subclass/composition.
