## Codex Project-Reference Loading (Hook-Independent)

Claude and Codex use static project-reference loading as the authority; hooks may accelerate discovery but never replace the explicit read.
When coding, planning, debugging, testing, or reviewing, open project docs explicitly using this routing.

**Always read:**
- `docs/project-config.json` (project-specific paths, commands, modules, and workflow/test settings)
- `docs/project-reference/docs-index-reference.md` (routes to the full `docs/project-reference/*` catalog)
- `docs/project-reference/lessons.md` (always-on guardrails and anti-patterns)

**Missing/stale context route:** If `docs/project-config.json`, the docs index, `lessons.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, or any task-required reference doc is missing or stale, auto-run `$project-init` or the narrow setup route (`$project-config`, `$docs-init`, `$scan-all`, `$scan --target=<key>`, `$ai-context-refresh`) before ordinary project-specific work. A full `$sync-codex` run preflights `CLAUDE.md`; a completed `$ai-context-refresh` run may invoke the standalone runner with `--skip=claude-md` after final source edits. Markerless roots need AI smart-merge unless `portability.requireUniversalGuides: false` is explicit.

**Situation-based docs** (pick by the phase you are about to enter — plan/investigate, edit, test, spec/doc, review — and read only docs the project selects in `referenceDocs` that exist):
- Planning, investigation, or design: `project-structure-reference.md`, `domain-entities-reference.md`, plus the docs below for every file type the plan touches
- Editing or writing code: `code-review-rules.md` plus the backend or frontend docs below for the file type
- Project structure/architecture/tech-stack/deployment/setup (any layer — backend, frontend, or infra): `project-structure-reference.md`
- Backend/CQRS/API/domain/entity changes: `backend-patterns-reference.md`, `domain-entities-reference.md`
- Frontend/UI/styling/design-system: `frontend-patterns-reference.md`, `scss-styling-guide.md` (or the configured styling reference), `design-system/README.md`
- Spec authoring, `docs/specs/` pathing, or TC format: `feature-spec-reference.md`, `spec-system-reference.md`, `spec-principles.md`
- Behavior/public-contract changes or spec-test-code sync: `workflow-spec-test-code-cycle-reference.md` plus the spec docs above
- Derived spec indexes/ERDs/reimplementation guides: `spec-system-reference.md` and source Feature Specs under `docs/specs/`
- Integration test implementation/review: `integration-test-reference.md`
- E2E test implementation/review: `e2e-test-reference.md`
- Test-data seeders: `seed-test-data-reference.md`
- Code review/audit work: `code-review-rules.md` plus the docs above for every file type under review
- Per-file conventions (`contextGroups[]`): before editing an unfamiliar path class, run `node .claude/hooks/lib/file-conventions.cjs --lookup <path>`

**Dedup:** a doc counts as loaded only when your own read returned its full content to this context after the last compaction and within roughly the last 200K tokens, and it has not changed since — cite it `(loaded)` instead of re-reading. A hook reminder, a summary, or a prior mention never counts; a delegated sub-agent starts empty, so name the resolved doc paths in its brief.

Never read all docs blindly: route from `docs-index-reference.md` and open only what the task needs.

# Browser Automation with playwright-cli

## Quick Summary

Use for configured web E2E interaction, visible human-QC journeys, evidence
capture, and Playwright test support. Read the project E2E config/reference
first; never infer startup, auth, seed data, or secrets.

## Quick start

```bash
# open new browser
playwright-cli open
# navigate to a page
playwright-cli goto https://playwright.dev
# interact with the page using refs from the snapshot
playwright-cli click e15
playwright-cli type "page.click"
playwright-cli press Enter
# take a screenshot (rarely used, as snapshot is more common)
playwright-cli screenshot
# close the browser
playwright-cli close
```

## E2E human-QC contract

Use this skill for the browser interaction/evidence part of a configured E2E
run. The caller must first resolve `docs/project-config.json` →
`e2eTesting.execution` and the linked `experienceVerification` surface; this
skill does not invent the app URL, startup command, account, seed data, or
runner dependency.

- Keep the browser visible for human-QC (`headed`), and record the viewport,
  device, locale, and network conditions. Use the project's configured runner
  path; `npx --no-install` is preferred when the project has a local CLI.
- Attach/read `console`, `requests`, page errors, screenshots, traces, and
  video when configured. Capture starts before the first interaction, artifacts
  are inspected rather than merely created, and sensitive values are redacted
  before saving or reporting.
- Use Playwright locator actions and web-first assertions for browser
  interactions. Locator actions auto-wait for Playwright's actionability
  checks; retrying assertions wait for the expected visible outcome. Add a
  bounded event or condition wait only for a meaningful signal those native
  operations do not cover. Use a project helper only when the project has
  configured or established one; do not wrap every action in a required
  `waitUntil` API.
- Do not add fixed sleeps to establish readiness, actionability, or success.
  For visible human-QC, apply `e2eTesting.execution.browser.actionDelayMs` only
  when the project config documents a presentation need, and only after the
  observed outcome is stable. The delay is optional and never replaces a
  Playwright wait or assertion.
- Load `storageStateRef` only from a project-owned secure reference/path. Do
  not paste cookies, tokens, passwords, localStorage, request headers, or raw
  storage state into prompts, reports, screenshots, traces, or shell history.
  Treat `state-save`, `cookie-*`, and `localstorage-*` output as sensitive.
- Do not use request mocking, direct state mutation, or browser storage writes
  to bypass the real user journey unless the configured scenario explicitly
  identifies it as a non-production setup step and the evidence records it.

playwright-cli video-start video.webm
playwright-cli video-chapter "Chapter Title" --description="Details" --duration=2000
playwright-cli video-stop

# annotate each subsequent action (click, type, ...) with a callout naming the action and highlighting the target
playwright-cli video-show-actions --duration=600 --position=top-right
playwright-cli video-hide-actions

# launch the dashboard for UI review / design feedback — user annotates the page, you receive the annotated screenshot, snapshot, and notes
playwright-cli show --annotate

# generate a Playwright locator for an element from its ref or selector
playwright-cli generate-locator e5 --raw

# show a persistent highlight overlay for an element, optionally with a custom style

playwright-cli highlight --hide
```

## Raw output

The global `--raw` option strips page status, generated code, and snapshot sections from the output, returning only the result value. Use it to pipe command output into other tools. Commands that don't produce output return nothing.

```bash
playwright-cli --raw eval "JSON.stringify(performance.timing)" | jq '.loadEventEnd - .navigationStart'
playwright-cli --raw eval "JSON.stringify([...document.querySelectorAll('a')].map(a => a.href))" > links.json
playwright-cli --raw snapshot > before.yml
playwright-cli click e5
playwright-cli --raw snapshot > after.yml
diff before.yml after.yml
TOKEN=$(playwright-cli --raw cookie-get session_id)
playwright-cli --raw localstorage-get theme
```

For structured output wrapping every reply as JSON, pass --json
```bash
playwright-cli list --json
```

## Open parameters
```bash
# Use specific browser when creating session
playwright-cli open --browser=chrome
playwright-cli open --browser=firefox
playwright-cli open --browser=webkit
playwright-cli open --browser=msedge

# Emulate a generic mobile device (Pixel 10 for Chromium, iPhone 17 for WebKit).
# Prefer this when a mobile layout is acceptable: mobile pages are usually
# lighter, so snapshots are smaller and cheaper.
playwright-cli open --mobile
playwright-cli open --device="iPhone 15"

# Use persistent profile (by default profile is in-memory)
playwright-cli open --persistent
# Use persistent profile with custom directory
playwright-cli open --profile=/path/to/profile

# Connect to browser via Playwright Extension
playwright-cli attach --extension=chrome

# Connect to a running Chrome or Edge by channel name
playwright-cli attach --cdp=chrome
playwright-cli attach --cdp=msedge

# Connect to a running browser via CDP endpoint
playwright-cli attach --cdp=http://localhost:9222

# Start with config file
playwright-cli open --config=my-config.json

# Close the browser
playwright-cli close
# Detach from an attached browser (leaves the external browser running)
playwright-cli -s=msedge detach
# Delete user data for the default session
playwright-cli delete-data
```

## URLs with `&` on Windows

On Windows, `cmd.exe` and PowerShell treat `&` as a command separator, so URLs with multiple query parameters get truncated before `playwright-cli` runs. Escape `&` with `^&` in `cmd.exe`, or use `--%` in PowerShell:

```batch
playwright-cli goto "https://example.com/?a=1^&b=2"
```

```powershell
playwright-cli --% goto "https://example.com/?a=1&b=2"
```

## Snapshots

After each command, playwright-cli provides a snapshot of the current browser state.

```bash
> playwright-cli goto https://example.com
### Page
- Page URL: https://example.com/
- Page Title: Example Domain
### Snapshot
[Snapshot](.playwright-cli/page-2026-02-14T19-22-42-679Z.yml)
```

You can also take a snapshot on demand using `playwright-cli snapshot` command. All the options below can be combined as needed.

```bash
# default - save to a file with timestamp-based name
playwright-cli snapshot

# save to file, use when snapshot is a part of the workflow result
playwright-cli snapshot --filename=after-click.yaml

# snapshot an element instead of the whole page
playwright-cli snapshot "#main"

# limit snapshot depth for efficiency, take a partial snapshot afterwards
playwright-cli snapshot --depth=4
playwright-cli snapshot e34

# include each element's bounding box as [box=x,y,width,height]
playwright-cli snapshot --boxes

# search a large snapshot instead of capturing it all — returns matching nodes
# with 3 lines of context around each match (like grep -C)
playwright-cli find "Add to cart"
playwright-cli find --regex "\\$[0-9]+\\.[0-9]{2}"
```

## Targeting elements

By default, use refs from the snapshot to interact with page elements.

```bash
# get snapshot with refs
playwright-cli snapshot

# interact using a ref
playwright-cli click e15
```

You can also use css selectors or Playwright locators.

```bash
# css selector
playwright-cli click "#main > button.submit"

# role locator
playwright-cli click "getByRole('button', { name: 'Submit' })"

# test id
playwright-cli click "getByTestId('submit-button')"
```

## Browser Sessions

```bash
# create new browser session named "mysession" with persistent profile
playwright-cli -s=mysession open example.com --persistent
# same with manually specified profile directory (use when requested explicitly)
playwright-cli -s=mysession open example.com --profile=/path/to/profile
playwright-cli -s=mysession click e6
playwright-cli -s=mysession close  # stop a named browser
playwright-cli -s=mysession delete-data  # delete user data for persistent session

playwright-cli list
# Close all browsers
playwright-cli close-all
# Forcefully kill all browser processes
playwright-cli kill-all
```

## Installation

If global `playwright-cli` command is not available, try a local version via `npx playwright cli`:

```bash
npx --no-install playwright --version
```

When local version is available, use `npx playwright cli` in all commands. Otherwise, install `playwright-cli` as a global command:

```bash
npm install -g @playwright/cli@latest
```

## Example: Form submission

```bash
playwright-cli open https://example.com/form
playwright-cli snapshot

playwright-cli fill e1 "user@example.com"
playwright-cli fill e2 "password123"
playwright-cli click e3
playwright-cli snapshot
playwright-cli close
```

## Example: Multi-tab workflow

```bash
playwright-cli open https://example.com
playwright-cli tab-new https://example.com/other
playwright-cli tab-list
playwright-cli tab-select 0
playwright-cli snapshot
playwright-cli close
```

## Example: Debugging with DevTools

```bash
playwright-cli open https://example.com
playwright-cli click e4
playwright-cli fill e7 "test"
playwright-cli console
playwright-cli requests
playwright-cli close
```

```bash
playwright-cli open https://example.com
playwright-cli tracing-start
playwright-cli click e4
playwright-cli fill e7 "test"
playwright-cli tracing-stop
playwright-cli close
```

## Example: Interactive session

Ask the user for UI review or design feedback. The user draws boxes on the live page and types comments; you receive the annotated screenshot, the snapshot of the marked region, and the user's notes. Use this whenever the user asks for "UI review", "design feedback", or to "ask the user what they think / want / mean":

```bash
playwright-cli open https://example.com
playwright-cli show --annotate
```

<!-- PROTOCOL-GUIDES:END -->

<!-- SYNC:critical-thinking-mindset:reminder -->

**MUST ATTENTION** critical + sequential thinking: every claim carries traced evidence (`file:line` for code, source URL or artifact section otherwise); confidence >80% to act, <60% do NOT recommend. Never present a guess as fact; admit uncertainty and stay skeptical of your own confidence.

<!-- /SYNC:critical-thinking-mindset:reminder -->

<!-- SYNC:ai-mistake-prevention:reminder -->

**MUST ATTENTION** Check project config, relevant references, and local evidence before applying stack-specific conventions; honor explicit N/A. ROOT-CAUSE GATE: before any project-related correction, use the appropriate root-cause investigation protocol; failed/unstable tests require the test-investigation protocol before editing source/tests — never force green.

<!-- /SYNC:ai-mistake-prevention:reminder -->

<!-- SYNC:project-protocol-overlay:reminder -->

**MUST ATTENTION** resolve this skill's overlays from the index at `<docsRoots.projectReference.path>/skill-protocols-reference.md` (default `docs/project-reference/`; overridable in `docs/project-config.json`); an empty task `referenceDocs` does NOT disable this lookup. Read ONLY matched bodies from the directory the index header names (default `docs/project-protocols/`). Specificity (exact > glob > `*`) ranks overlays against EACH OTHER, never against the skill. Missing/malformed body → report and skip; no index or no match → proceed silently. Overlays are ADDITIVE ONLY — never an authority escalation or a gate waiver; equal-tier contradiction goes to the user.

<!-- /SYNC:project-protocol-overlay:reminder -->

<!-- SYNC:e2e-visual-design-contract:reminder -->

**MUST ATTENTION** visual E2E/QC resolves the project design authority first, applies project design-system and frontend decisions plus applicable `UI-*`/`DD-*`/`CL-*` roles, records component ownership using the project's taxonomy or observed boundaries, sends static source findings to `$ui-review` and runtime image evidence to `$experience-review`, captures states and transitions required by the configured evidence contract, reloads the convention docs then reads and records each required capture before synthesizing findings with coverage gaps, treats `UIX`/UI/accessibility-floor findings as blocking and `UIX-POLISH`/DD identity as advisory, never invents measurements, and never auto-promotes baselines; non-visual runs state `N/A`.

## SYNC:ai-sdd-artifact-contract:reminder

- **MANDATORY** Apply `shared/sdd-artifact-contract.md`; keep reusable AI-SDD in `.claude` and local rules in project docs.
- **MANDATORY** Resolve and validate `specArtifacts`: use valid native owner/case/variant identity and assertion-bearing evidence; use strict-default TC/TestSpec only when the profile is absent; block a malformed or unsupported declaration without fallback.
- **MANDATORY** Code-to-spec extraction is reference-only until canonical acceptance; any supported AI tool may execute with synced context.
- **MANDATORY** Update `.claude` source before syncing generated mirrors; do not manually edit `.agents`, `.codex`, or `AGENTS.md`.
- **MANDATORY** Missing or stale project config, root instruction files, or required reference docs route project-specific work through `$project-init` or the narrow setup route automatically.
**[TASK-PLANNING] [MANDATORY]** BEFORE executing any workflow or skill step, create/update task tracking for all planned steps, analyze the task graph (output dependencies, shared write targets) into ordered parallel waves per PARALLELIZE before starting any task, then keep it synchronized as each step starts/completes. Preserve fixed ordering when a skill or workflow explicitly fixes it.
- **MANDATORY** Pin `Original goal:` before the first action and keep `User prompts this session: P1…Pn` current; re-read both at every step, before delegation, and after compaction.
- **MANDATORY** Before claiming done, map the result to the original goal and every prompt (`P# → done | deferred | n/a`); never store secrets in them.
## [LESSON-LEARNED-REMINDER] [BLOCKING] Task Planning & Continuous Improvement — MANDATORY. Do not skip.

Break work into small tasks (task tracking) before starting. Add final task: "Analyze AI mistakes & lessons learned".

**Extract lessons — ROOT CAUSE ONLY, not symptom fixes:**
1. Name the FAILURE MODE (reasoning/assumption failure), not symptom — "assumed API existed without reading source" not "used wrong enum value".
2. Generality test: does this failure mode apply to ≥3 contexts/codebases? If not, abstract one level up.
3. Write as a universal rule — strip project-specific names/paths/classes. Useful on any codebase.
4. Consolidate: multiple mistakes sharing one failure mode → ONE lesson.
5. **Recurrence gate:** "Would this recur in future session WITHOUT this reminder?" — No → skip `$learn`.
6. **Auto-fix gate:** "Could `$code-review`/`$code-simplifier`/`$security-review`/a linter catch this?" — Yes → improve review skill instead.
7. BOTH gates pass → ask user to run `$learn`.
**[CRITICAL-THINKING-MINDSET]** Apply critical thinking, sequential thinking. Every claim needs traced proof, confidence >80% to act.
**Anti-hallucination principle:** Never present guess as fact — cite sources for every claim, admit uncertainty freely, self-check output for errors, cross-reference independently, stay skeptical of own confidence — certainty without evidence root of all hallucination.
**AI Attention principle (Primacy-Recency):** Put the 3 most critical rules at both top and bottom of long prompts/protocols so instruction adherence survives long context windows.
**Goal-driven execution:** Define success criteria first, loop until verified, and stop only when observable checks pass.
**Tests verify intent:** Tests must protect business rules/invariants and fail when the protected intent breaks, not only mirror current behavior.
**Judgement integrity:** For theory checks, judgements, evaluations and gap hunts, the prompt's premise is a hypothesis — test it AND its opposite with one evidence bar (web-verify external facts), why-review the draft as an inline self-check (run the `why-review` skill only for a formal review/audit/gap-hunt deliverable or a MEDIUM+/consequential issue the inline pass cannot settle), never invent findings or manufacture disagreement ("no material issues" is a valid verdict); end with a `Bias check:` line (`SYNC:judgement-integrity`).
## Common AI Mistake Prevention (System Lessons)

- **Resolve project applicability before using framework examples.** Read the project config and relevant references, then inspect local evidence; honor explicit N/A and never impose a language, framework, architecture layer, styling method, tool, or runtime surface the project does not use.
- **ROOT-CAUSE GATE — INVESTIGATE FIRST.** Before applying any project-related correction, always use the project's root-cause investigation protocol and establish the cause; the failure site may be only a symptom.
- **FAILED-TEST GATE.** For any failed or unstable test, use the project's test-investigation protocol before editing source or tests; never change either side merely to force green.
- **Re-read and re-verify after context compaction or resume.** Compaction wipes read state and memory; summaries describe intent, not environment state. Re-read before editing, audit current state (git status, files) before creating anything new, grep-verify sub-agent output — every "completed" claim is a hypothesis until evidence confirms it.
- **Verify AI-generated content against actual code.** AI hallucinates APIs, class names, method signatures. Grep to confirm existence before documenting/referencing.
- **Trace every consumer before and after a change.** Map referencing files before deleting; after bulk replacements, renames, or extractions, grep ALL consumer file types (templates, configs, catalogs and generated files fail silently) for every old or removed name; trace the full dependency chain of an edited definition; update docs that embed canonical data alongside their source.
- **Trace ALL code paths when verifying correctness.** Code existing ≠ code executing. Trace early exits, error branches, conditional skips — not just happy path.
- **Sub-agents: inherit, cover, persist.** Sub-agents know only their agent .md definition — use custom agent types, not built-in Explore. Reconcile the union of assignments against the full target list — category splits miss boundary items. Make the report write the first deliverable, appended per file/section with bounded scope; a truncated run with no report → spawn a narrower scope, never the same prompt.
- **Ownership before action.** When investigating a failure, ask which part owns the behavior before changing anything. Trace the wrong state to the component responsible for its invariant, then make one authoritative correction there.
- **Test failure → record a provisional verdict before trace/edit, then investigate.** Use the full five-way taxonomy: SOURCE-WRONG (production violates intent), TEST-WRONG (assertion/setup is stale), TEST-NOT-OPTIMAL (valid but fragile or low-signal test), ENVIRONMENT-BLOCKED (external state prevents a verdict), or AMBIGUOUS (intent/evidence cannot choose safely). Then trace root cause and triangulate against the governing spec if one exists (the business spec root — default `docs/specs`; a `specRoots.business.path` entry in `docs/project-config.json` overrides the path) AND source. NEVER weaken an assertion, add a skip, relax a timeout, or change source merely to force green.
- **Assume existing values are intentional — ask WHY before changing OR flagging one as a defect.** Before changing or reporting any constant/limit/flag/cutoff, read comments, git blame, the CALLER's ordering (the guarantee usually runs immediately BEFORE the cited line), and 2+ sibling call sites. A doc stating WHAT without WHY is missing rationale, not proof of a missing guard — and an accurate `file:line` citation proves the transcription, never the defect.
- **Verify ALL affected outputs, not just the first.** One build green ≠ all green. Multi-stack changes (backend/frontend/tests/docs) require verifying EVERY output.
- **Evaluate fit before copying a nearby pattern.** Closest example ≠ matching preconditions — verify the new context shares the same constraints, base classes, scope, lifetime.
- **Holistic analysis — resist the nearest-attention trap.** Do not dive into the first plausible cause. List every precondition (configuration, environment, inputs, dependencies, versions, permissions, state) and verify each against evidence. Ask "what would falsify this?" — if nothing, it is not a hypothesis.
- **Minimal changes — apply the relevance test.** Every change must trace to the reported problem: "Would this change exist if I were not addressing this request?" — if not, remove or disclose it; never silently expand scope.
- **Surface ambiguity before coding — don't pick silently.** Multiple valid interpretations → present each with effort ("(1) [N h], (2) [N h]. Which matters?"), list assumptions, name a simpler path when one exists.
- **Why-Review adversarial mindset — apply when reviewing any plan, decision, or design.** Default SKEPTIC: steel-man a rejected alternative, invert each reason ("what does it sacrifice?"), stress-test the top 2-3 assumptions, run a pre-mortem. Quality = causal reasoning + mitigations + evidence, not section presence.
- **OOM/memory: check row count before row size.** An unbounded query (no DB filter for the trigger) → push the filter to the DB; then large rows → projection. Row reduction > projection in ROI.
- **Assert the outcome your system OWNS, never the intermediate state your INFRASTRUCTURE owns.** For async work (queues, retries, background jobs, caches, replication) assert the final business/entity state — NEVER delivery bookkeeping (consume/send status, attempt counts, last-error, broker/scheduler/outbox rows) that ANY co-running process can write: green alone, flaky once anything shares that broker + database. Gate: "would this hold no matter WHICH process did the work?" Process-local fault injection is a stress amplifier (arm → bounded window → disarm → assert convergence), never a precondition.
- **Store disposable generated output in the project workspace.** If an output can be regenerated and is not source code, a canonical source-of-truth, or an intentionally versioned projection, write it under the project-root `tmp/` or `temp/` directory (prefer `tmp/`), scoped to the run. This includes temporary state, integration/E2E results, reports, logs, screenshots, traces, videos, coverage, dumps, and candidate evidence. Never put these outputs in source, docs, the plans root (default `plans/`; a `docsRoots.plans.path` entry in `docs/project-config.json` overrides the path), the team-artifacts root (default `team-artifacts/`; `docsRoots.teamArtifacts.path` in the same config overrides the path), or mirror directories; the project-root `.gitignore` must ignore `/tmp/` and `/temp/` by default. Committed fixtures, accepted baselines, canonical specs/docs, and explicitly versioned generated mirrors remain at their declared owner paths.
- **Judge the environment before judging the code — a competing hypothesis, not a fallback.** A bug, failed test, error, or odd output is NOT proof of a code defect. Before any verdict, sweep environment preconditions (toolchain/lockfile state, stale build/cache artifacts, env vars and config, service dependencies, ports/clock, OS path/locale, permissions, leftover processes/test data) AND transient resource pressure (RAM/OOM, CPU, disk/temp, handle and connection-pool limits, network, a timeout that is really slowness). Tell-tale: non-deterministic, fails only in parallel, on one machine or only on CI, or an error naming resources. Cite the discriminator you ran (clean environment? path changed? concurrency 1?) — a verdict without one is a guess. Fix an environment cause in the environment; NEVER edit product code or weaken/skip a test to absorb it; a failure that vanishes on retry stays unexplained until its mechanism is named.
- **Cross-platform execution is a required contract.** Before authoring or changing a tool, script, process launcher, path assertion, or filesystem test, name the supported Windows, macOS, and Linux behaviors. Use platform-neutral APIs and literal argv vectors; never infer shell, temp-path, executable-extension, ACL, or symlink semantics from the current host. A documented command gives its Windows, macOS, and Linux form (Python: `py -3` on Windows, `python3` on macOS/Linux; shell: PowerShell/`.cmd` beside POSIX `sh`) or one platform-neutral runner such as `node <script>`. Canonicalize existing paths before identity, hashing, or equality checks; test native Windows and POSIX seams when behavior differs; keep CI platform matrices authoritative. Preserve fail-closed security boundaries — repair the fixture or platform branch, never weaken the guard just to make one OS green.
- **Keep domain concepts out of generic/shared/infrastructure layers.** A reusable layer must reference NO consumer-specific domain concept (tenant/customer/product IDs, business entities, feature rules); such a leak compiles, runs, and passes review while coupling the layer to one consumer. Push domain fields/logic down into the consumer via subclass/composition.
