## Codex Project-Reference Loading (Hook-Independent)

Claude and Codex use static project-reference loading as the authority; hooks may accelerate discovery but never replace the explicit read.
When coding, planning, debugging, testing, or reviewing, open project docs explicitly using this routing.

**Always read:**
- `docs/project-config.json` (project-specific paths, commands, modules, and workflow/test settings)
- `docs/project-reference/docs-index-reference.md` (routes to the full `docs/project-reference/*` catalog)
- `docs/project-reference/lessons.md` (always-on guardrails and anti-patterns)

**Missing/stale context route:** If `docs/project-config.json`, the docs index, `lessons.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, or any task-required reference doc is missing or stale, auto-run `$project-init` or the narrow setup route (`$project-config`, `$docs-init`, `$scan-all`, `$scan --target=<key>`, `$ai-context-refresh`) before ordinary project-specific work. A full `$sync-codex` run preflights `CLAUDE.md`; a completed `$ai-context-refresh` run may invoke the standalone runner with `--skip=claude-md` after final source edits. Markerless roots need AI smart-merge unless `portability.requireUniversalGuides: false` is explicit.

**Situation-based docs** (pick by the phase you are about to enter — plan/investigate, edit, test, spec/doc, review — and read only docs the project selects in `referenceDocs` that exist):
- Planning, investigation, or design: `project-structure-reference.md`, `domain-entities-reference.md`, plus the docs below for every file type the plan touches
- Editing or writing code: `code-review-rules.md` plus the backend or frontend docs below for the file type
- Project structure/architecture/tech-stack/deployment/setup (any layer — backend, frontend, or infra): `project-structure-reference.md`
- Backend/CQRS/API/domain/entity changes: `backend-patterns-reference.md`, `domain-entities-reference.md`
- Frontend/UI/styling/design-system: `frontend-patterns-reference.md`, `scss-styling-guide.md` (or the configured styling reference), `design-system/README.md`
- Spec authoring, `docs/specs/` pathing, or TC format: `feature-spec-reference.md`, `spec-system-reference.md`, `spec-principles.md`
- Behavior/public-contract changes or spec-test-code sync: `workflow-spec-test-code-cycle-reference.md` plus the spec docs above
- Derived spec indexes/ERDs/reimplementation guides: `spec-system-reference.md` and source Feature Specs under `docs/specs/`
- Integration test implementation/review: `integration-test-reference.md`
- E2E test implementation/review: `e2e-test-reference.md`
- Test-data seeders: `seed-test-data-reference.md`
- Code review/audit work: `code-review-rules.md` plus the docs above for every file type under review
- Per-file conventions (`contextGroups[]`): before editing an unfamiliar path class, run `node .claude/hooks/lib/file-conventions.cjs --lookup <path>`

**Dedup:** a doc counts as loaded only when your own read returned its full content to this context after the last compaction and within roughly the last 200K tokens, and it has not changed since — cite it `(loaded)` instead of re-reading. A hook reminder, a summary, or a prior mention never counts; a delegated sub-agent starts empty, so name the resolved doc paths in its brief.

Never read all docs blindly: route from `docs-index-reference.md` and open only what the task needs.

## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Force every assumption-laden plan decision and every preservation-critical behavior through explicit user confirmation BEFORE implementation — by interviewing the user with critical questions that validate assumptions and surface issues — so no unstated assumption silently reaches code.

**Summary:**

- **Purpose:** validate a finished plan via a critical-questions interview so every assumption-laden decision and every preservation-critical behavior is user-confirmed BEFORE implementation — no unstated assumption silently reaches code.
- **Main steps (run in order):** Phase 0 Detect Plan Type → resolve plan path (`$ARGUMENTS` / `## Plan Context` / ask) → load `mode` + `questions` range as hard constraints → Phase 0.5 resolve Applicability / Plan Gate → Step 1 Read `plan.md` + all `phase-*.md`, flag decisions/assumptions/risks/tradeoffs → Step 2 Extract topics across 9 categories (Applicability, Architecture, Assumptions, Tradeoffs, Risks, Scope, New Tech/Lib, Test Specs, Preservation) → Step 3 Generate questions (2-4 concrete options each, surface implicit decisions) → Step 4 Interview by asking the user directly (≤4 per call) → Step 5 Document answers → offer implement/refine/skip.
- **Phase 0 weights everything:** plan type (bugfix/feature/migration/refactor/other) decides which question categories fire; any fix/bug/regression/broken/defect keyword makes the Preservation question BLOCKING — never skip it.
- **The output is a REAL interview, not a self-answer:** honor the `questions` MIN-MAX range from `## Plan Context`, give 2-4 concrete options per question, treat the Preservation "Unsure" answer as BLOCKED → route to `$plan`; if the plan adds new tech/packages, probe whether alternatives were evaluated before accepting the choice.
- **Persist results narrowly:** add ONLY a `## Validation Summary` (confirmed decisions + action items) to `plan.md` — NEVER edit phase files; close by offering implement/refine/skip by asking the user directly.
- **Applicability is mandatory for every plan:** read `.claude/skills/shared/product-roadmap-contract.md`, verify the plan's branch-specific `## Plan Gate`, and ask the owner to confirm the embedded slice/decomposition, explicit roadmap outcome, framework technical outcome, or EXEMPT boundary plus non-goals, scenario proof, commands, evidence, and approval. `BLOCKED`, `OPEN`, `MISSING`, or `REQUIRED` cannot be silently upgraded.

**Workflow:**

1. **Detect Plan Type** — Classify plan (bugfix/feature/migration/refactor) to weight question categories
2. **Read Plan** — Parse plan.md + phase files for decisions, assumptions, risks
3. **Extract Topics** — Scan architecture, assumptions, tradeoffs, risks, scope keywords
4. **Generate Questions** — Formulate concrete questions with 2-4 options each
5. **Interview User** — Present questions using configured count range
6. **Document Answers** — Add Validation Summary section to plan.md

**Key Rules:**

- MUST ATTENTION use ask the user directly — NEVER auto-decide on behalf of user — why: the user owns every assumption-laden choice, not the agent
- Ask ONLY about genuine choices affecting implementation — NEVER about non-decision points — why: noise questions burn the interview budget and erode trust
- Bugfix plans ALWAYS trigger the Preservation question (keywords: fix, bug, regression, broken, defect) — why: an unverified preserved-correctness invariant is a silent regression
- Persist via a `## Validation Summary` on `plan.md` — NEVER modify phase files — why: phase files are the plan's source of truth; validation is a read-then-annotate pass
- For embedded, explicit-roadmap, framework/library, or EXEMPT plans, include the final applicability status and exact owning paths in that same summary; use each branch only when the plan records its required evidence and owner.

## First Principle — Easy to Change

> **Success metric for every coding decision: _future change cost._** DRY, SRP,
> abstraction, design patterns, naming, layering, and tests serve one goal:
> **make the next change cheaper**.

When evaluating code, refactors, tests, abstractions, or questions, ask:
**does this make the next change cheaper or more expensive?**

- Reject "best practices" that raise change cost: premature abstraction,
  speculative generality, leaky indirection, ceremony without payoff.
- Name real enemies: **coupling, hidden state, duplicated knowledge, unclear
  intent, irreversible decisions exposed too early**.
- Prefer simple designs easy to change over sophisticated designs that are not.

Apply this lens before downstream rules; if a rule raises change cost, this
principle wins.

## Phase 0: Detect Plan Type

Classify plan type BEFORE generating questions; it drives category weighting:

| Plan Type     | Detection                                                         | Mandatory Extra Categories            |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Bugfix**    | Title/frontmatter: `fix`, `bug`, `regression`, `broken`, `defect` | Preservation (BLOCKING)               |
| **Feature**   | New capability, no fix keywords                                   | Architecture, Assumptions, Test Specs |
| **Migration** | Schema change, EF migration, data move                            | Risks, Preservation, Scope            |
| **Refactor**  | Restructure/clean up, no behavior change                          | Preservation, Tradeoffs               |
| **Other**     | None of above                                                     | Architecture, Scope                   |

**Bugfix detection is BLOCKING** — NEVER skip Preservation question when fix/bug/regression/broken/defect keywords present.

## Plan Resolution

1. `$ARGUMENTS` provided → use that path
2. Else use the active path from `## Plan Context`
3. No plan → ask user for a path or run `$plan` first

## Phase 0.5: Applicability / Plan Gate

Before extracting technical questions, classify the plan's branch.

- Embedded large-idea: read the owning PBI/spec; verify complete `large_idea_decomposition`, selected slice, non-goals/deferred owners, and conditional scenario artifact when needed. Do not require the product roadmap (default `docs/product-roadmap.md`; a `docsRoots.productRoadmap.path` entry in `docs/project-config.json` overrides the path) or a product milestone.
- Explicit roadmap: read the product roadmap (default `docs/product-roadmap.md`; a `docsRoots.productRoadmap.path` entry in `docs/project-config.json` overrides the path), selected milestone scope brief, and `scenario-analysis.md`.
- Framework/library: read technical scope, operational scenarios, generated-carrier evidence, and commands.
- Verify one `## Plan Gate` in `plan.md`: matching branch/outcome/boundaries; explicit non-goals; lifecycle terms when applicable; branch decision state; known or explicitly inapplicable skeleton/configuration; build/test/run commands; redacted evidence; `Human approval: APPROVED`.
- Missing upstream artifacts or `BLOCKED`/`OPEN`/`MISSING`/`REQUIRED` values create a blocking Applicability question. Do not implement or recommend `implement` while unresolved.
- Isolated brownfield/bugfix: verify the shared contract's EXEMPT branch: scope brief and plan reason/owner, required sibling scenario, explicit `EXEMPT` roadmap/milestone, explicit `N/A` product-decision rationale, known commands/evidence/approval. Retain preservation/spec/test/review questions.

## Configuration (from injected context)

Check `## Plan Context` section:

- `mode` — auto/prompt/off
- `questions` — MIN-MAX range (e.g. `3-8`)

Treat both as hard constraints.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Read Plan Files

Read plan directory:

- `plan.md` — overview + phases list
- `phase-*.md` — all phase files
- Flag: decision points, assumptions, risks, tradeoffs

### Step 2: Extract Question Topics

| Category         | Keywords                                                                                   |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Architecture** | approach, pattern, design, structure, database, API                                        |
| **Assumptions**  | assume, expect, should, will, must, default                                                |
| **Tradeoffs**    | tradeoff, vs, alternative, option, choice, either/or                                       |
| **Risks**        | risk, might, could fail, dependency, blocker, concern                                      |
| **Scope**        | phase, MVP, future, out of scope, nice to have                                             |
| **New Tech/Lib** | install, add package, new dependency, npm install, dotnet add, unfamiliar framework names  |
| **Test Specs**   | TC-, test case, coverage, TDD, test specification                                          |
| **Preservation** | auto-trigger on bugfix keywords in title/frontmatter — scan Preservation Inventory section |
| **Product Readiness** | roadmap-applicable or EXEMPT plan — scan the applicable `## Plan Gate` branch, scope/scenario refs, non-goals, definitions, evidence, and human approval |

### Step 3: Generate Questions

**Format rules:**

- 2-4 concrete options per question
- Mark recommended with "(Recommended)" suffix
- "Other" option automatic — do NOT add
- Surface implicit decisions

For a roadmap-applicable plan, ask a Product Readiness question before lower-level choices:

> Does the plan implement the owning slice/outcome or technical boundary exactly, with the stated non-goals, lifecycle definitions where applicable, scenario proof, known skeleton/commands, redacted evidence, and human approval?

Offer concrete choices such as: **Yes, approve the Plan Gate (Recommended)**; **No, revise the scope/plan**; **A product decision remains open**; **This plan is an explicitly accepted isolated-change exemption**. Never answer this question from the plan author's confidence alone.

**Examples:**

```
Category: Architecture
Question: "How should validation results be persisted?"
Options:
1. Save to plan.md frontmatter (Recommended) — updates existing plan
2. Create validation-answers.md — separate answers file
3. Don't persist — ephemeral validation only
```

```
Category: Assumptions
Question: "Plan assumes API rate limiting not needed. Correct?"
Options:
1. Yes, not needed for MVP
2. No, add basic rate limiting now (Recommended)
3. Defer to Phase 2
```

```
Category: Preservation (MANDATORY when title/frontmatter: fix, bug, regression, broken, defect)
Question: "List 2-3 inputs where CURRENT code is correct. Will fix change behavior on any?"
Options (multi-select):
1. "Current code correct on: {input A}. Fix preserves behavior." (Recommended)
2. "Current code correct on: {input B}. Fix CHANGES behavior because: {justification}"
3. "Current code has NO preserved-correctness inputs — every input was broken" (rare; requires confirmation)
4. "Unsure — need to investigate" (STOP: run $plan preservation analysis)
```

**Follow-up rules:**

- Option 2 selected → `plan.md` Preservation Inventory MUST cite Preservation TC asserting new behavior is intended
- Option 4 selected → return BLOCKED status, recommend `$plan` before proceeding
- Option 3 selected → ask the user directly follow-up: "Confirm: current code has NO preserved invariant? [Yes, every input broken / No, missed some — re-investigate]"

### Step 4: Interview User

Use ask the user directly — NEVER skip or auto-answer.

**Rules:**

- Use question count from `## Plan Context` → `Validation: mode=X, questions=MIN-MAX`
- Group related questions (max 4 per tool call)
- Focus: assumptions, risks, tradeoffs, architecture
- MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION: if plan introduces new tech/packages, ask: "Plan uses {lib}. Were alternatives evaluated? Confirm choice or research more?"

### Step 5: Document Answers

Add `## Validation Summary` to `plan.md`:

```markdown
## Validation Summary

**Validated:** {date}
**Questions asked:** {count}

### Applicability

- **Branch:** DECOMPOSITION-EMBEDDED | EXPLICIT-ROADMAP | FRAMEWORK-LIBRARY | EXEMPT | BLOCKED
- **Owning artifact / roadmap:** `{paths}` or `NOT APPLICABLE — embedded/framework/EXEMPT`
- **Slice / milestone / technical outcome:** `{ID and outcome}`
- **Scope handoff / scenarios:** `{paths or conditional N/A}`
- **Plan Gate:** DECOMPOSITION-EMBEDDED | READY | FRAMEWORK-LIBRARY | EXEMPT | BLOCKED
- **Human approval:** APPROVED | REQUIRED

### Confirmed Decisions

- {decision 1}: {user choice}
- {decision 2}: {user choice}

### Action Items

- [ ] {changes needed based on answers}
```

NEVER modify phase files — only document what needs updating.

## Output

After validation:

- Questions asked count
- Key decisions confirmed
- Items flagged for plan revision
- Recommendation: proceed to implementation OR revise plan first

## Next Steps

**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION — NO EXCEPTIONS** after completing, use ask the user directly to present:

- **"$feature-implement (Recommended)"** — Begin implementation with validated plan
- **"$refine"** — If plan needs PBI refinement first
- **"Skip, continue manually"** — User decides

---

> **[BLOCKING]** MUST ATTENTION use ask the user directly to interview user. Completing without asking ≥1 question = violation.

> **[IMPORTANT]** Use task tracking to break ALL work into small tasks BEFORE starting — including tasks for each file read. For simple tasks, AI MUST ATTENTION ask user whether to skip.

> **External Memory:** Complex/lengthy work → write findings + results to `tmp/reports/` — prevents context loss.

> **Evidence Gate:** MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION — every claim requires `file:line` proof or traced evidence with confidence % (>80% act, <80% verify first).

<!-- SYNC:project-reference-docs-guide -->

> **Project Reference Docs Gate (static JIT)** — Run after task-tracking bootstrap, immediately before target/source reads, grep, edits, tests, or analysis. Project docs override generic framework assumptions; hooks may remind or accelerate this gate but never prove it ran.
>
> 1. **Scope** — identify file types, domain area, and operation.
> 2. **Project config is OPTIONAL.** Read the configured project-config file via its loader (default `docs/project-config.json`) when it exists. Absent is a supported state, not an error: run on portable defaults, derive project facts (paths, commands, conventions, architecture, test/spec layout) from repository evidence (manifests, lockfiles, scripts, CI, layout, root instruction files), state material assumptions, never block, and at most OFFER `$project-init` or `$project-config` once. Present → minimum valid shape is a non-empty `project.name`; omitted optional capabilities use neutral defaults or skip. A DECLARED section left malformed or incomplete is a configuration error: fail closed on it and run `$project-init` or `$project-config` before relying on it — why: silent defaults would present wrong facts as authoritative. Verify material config hints against repository evidence; generic defaults are never project facts.
> 3. **Select docs.** Always-on: the project-init-owned `lessons.md` and docs-index inputs at their configured owner paths — read independently, never appended to `referenceDocs`. Task-specific: an explicit `referenceDocs` array is the exact selection, subsets and `[]` included; absent → the runtime capability-aware resolver (portable baseline plus configuration- or repository-evidenced capabilities; may be empty). The scan-target manifest is a registry, not a default selection. Filenames resolve under the reference-docs root (default `docs/project-reference`; `docsRoots.projectReference.path` in `docs/project-config.json` overrides it). Custom-doc schema, ownership, and path-safety rules: `.claude/skills/scan/references/targets.md`.
> 4. **Route by phase.** Just in time, read the selected docs the table names for the phase you are ABOUT to enter, plus any selected custom doc whose `purpose` covers that phase. An unmatched row is `Not applicable`, never a blocker.

> 6. **Cite and repair.** State `Reference docs read: ... | Not applicable: ...` (record an explicit empty selection); still honor references the active skill or task requires. A missing/stale always-on input or selected/required doc, or a malformed declared config section → `$project-init` or the narrow owner route (`$project-config`, `$docs-init`, `$scan --target=<key>`, `$ai-context-refresh`) before relying on it.
> 7. **Dedup within ~200K tokens.** A doc counts as loaded only when its full content came back to THIS context from your own read, after the last compaction and within roughly the last 200K tokens, and it has not changed since — list it in `Reference docs read:` as `<doc> (loaded)` and skip the re-read. Everything else is not loaded: a hook reminder, a summary, a doc merely named in the conversation, or a read by another agent. Re-select and re-read after compaction, resume, a material context change, or ~200K tokens of growth (= the file-convention hook default). A delegated sub-agent starts empty: name the resolved doc paths in its brief.

TDD-first references existing TCs with `Evidence: TBD`; implement-first keeps `TBD` until the configured spec/test workflow fills it.
> 5. Before any new workflow step: call the current task list and re-read the phase file.
> 6. On context compaction: call the current task list FIRST — never create duplicate tasks.
> 7. Verify every native case and its assertion, or every strict-default TC, before marking a phase complete; final evidence must be `file:line`, not TBD.
> 8. **Purpose-oriented naming:** For every planned public or cross-layer contract, port, interface, module, or adapter, name the consumer-visible capability or domain purpose; keep provider, framework, and transport names in concrete implementations (`IStorage`/`Storage` → `AzureBlobStorage`). — why: a contract name should survive an implementation swap.
> 9. **Contract-fit gate:** Check the proposed name against its callers and all implementations; use a narrower purpose name when a broad name overpromises (`IObjectStore` or `DocumentStore` instead of `IStorage` when the behavior is narrower). — why: abstraction names must describe the actual contract, not hide a mismatch.
> 10. **No speculative abstraction:** Plan an interface or port only when a real boundary, substitution need, or multiple meaningful implementations justifies it; keep a concrete type when it is the honest contract. — why: an unnecessary abstraction adds indirection and a second name without reducing change cost.
> 11. **Language convention:** Preserve the repository's naming syntax (`I` prefix where the language/project uses it); never force `I` or `Interface` markers across languages. — why: semantic purpose is portable, syntax is not.
> 12. **Foundation obligations — when the plan CREATES or CHANGES how the project is built, run, tested, or checked** (build or CI configuration, test harness, containerization, toolchain/dependency management, module boundaries, quality tooling): run `SYNC:engineering-foundation-gate` — its seven dimensions F1-F7, the four profile axes and the warranting matrix are in `.claude/docs/engineering-foundation-catalog.md`, which the plan reads directly when no carrier of that gate ran upstream — and carry every dimension it marks warranted into the plan as an **explicit phase with acceptance criteria** — never as an assumption that someone handles it later. Record each dimension deliberately skipped, with the reason. — why: a plan that stands up a foundation and silently omits a warranted dimension makes that omission permanent and invisible; foundations cost near nothing at creation and a great deal to retrofit.
>
> **Mode:** TDD-first → reference existing native cases (strict-default TCs only when `specArtifacts` is absent) with `Evidence: TBD`. Implement-first → use TBD until the project's configured spec/test workflow fills it; absent a profile, `$spec [mode=tests]` is the strict-default route. A declared invalid profile blocks instead of selecting this fallback.

> **AI Mistake Prevention** — Failure modes to avoid on every task:
>
> **Project applicability gate.** Before applying a stack, layer, style, tool, or architecture rule, read the project's config and relevant references, then check local implementations. Treat framework examples as examples; honor explicit N/A and do not require a technology or convention the project does not use.
> **ROOT-CAUSE GATE — INVESTIGATE FIRST.** Before applying any project-related correction, always use the project's root-cause investigation protocol and establish the cause; the failure site may be only a symptom.
> **FAILED-TEST GATE.** For any failed or unstable test, use the project's test-investigation protocol before editing source or tests; never change either side merely to force green.
> **Re-read files after context changes.** Context compaction, resume, or long-running work can make memory stale; verify current files before acting.
> **Verify generated content against source evidence.** AI hallucinates APIs, names, claims, and document facts. Check the relevant source before documenting or referencing.
> **Check downstream references before deleting or renaming.** Removing an artifact can stale docs, generated mirrors, configs, and callers; map references first.
> **Trace the full impact chain after edits.** Changing a definition can miss derived outputs and consumers. Follow the affected chain before declaring done.
> **Verify ALL affected outputs, not just the first.** One green check is not all green checks; validate every output surface the change can affect.
> **Assume existing values are intentional — ask WHY before changing OR flagging one as a defect.** Before changing or reporting a constant, limit, flag, cutoff, wording, or pattern, read nearby context and history, the CALLER's ordering, and 2+ sibling call sites of the same convention. A doc stating WHAT without WHY is missing rationale, not proof of a missing guard.
> **Surface ambiguity before acting — don't pick silently.** Multiple valid interpretations require an explicit question or stated assumption with risk.
> **Assert the outcome your system owns, not the intermediate state your infrastructure owns.** When verifying async work, assert the final business state — never the delivery/retry bookkeeping held in shared infrastructure that any co-running process can write. Such a check passes when run alone and flakes the moment anything else shares that infrastructure.
> **Store disposable generated output in the project workspace.** If an output can be regenerated and is not source code, a canonical source-of-truth, or an intentionally versioned projection, write it under the project-root `tmp/` or `temp/` directory (prefer `tmp/`), scoped to the run. This includes temporary state, integration/E2E results, reports, logs, screenshots, traces, videos, coverage, dumps, and candidate evidence. Never put these outputs in source, docs, the plans root (default `plans/`; a `docsRoots.plans.path` entry in `docs/project-config.json` overrides the path), the team-artifacts root (default `team-artifacts/`; `docsRoots.teamArtifacts.path` in the same config overrides the path), or mirror directories; the project-root `.gitignore` must ignore `/tmp/` and `/temp/` by default. Committed fixtures, accepted baselines, canonical specs/docs, and explicitly versioned generated mirrors remain at their declared owner paths.
> **Judge the environment before judging the code.** A bug report, failed test, error, or unexpected output is not proof of a code defect. Before and during adjudication, weigh environment causes as a competing hypothesis — setup, config, version and dependency state, service dependencies, stale artifacts or leftover state, and transient resource pressure (RAM, CPU, disk, handles, network). State the discriminator you ran; fix an environment cause in the environment, never by editing product code or weakening a test to absorb it.
> **Keep shared guidance role-relevant.** Universal guidance must help every receiving skill or agent; code-specific obligations belong only in code-specific protocols.

- **MANDATORY** Pick docs by the phase you are about to enter — plan/investigate, edit code, tests, specs/docs, review — from the gate's routing table, JUST IN TIME before the first target read/grep/edit/test, plus the file's `contextGroups[]` conventions before editing it; cite `Reference docs read: ...`.

> **Project Protocol Overlay** — Before executing this skill, resolve project overlays from the index at `<docsRoots.projectReference.path>/skill-protocols-reference.md` (default `docs/project-reference/`; `docsRoots.projectReference.path` in `docs/project-config.json` overrides it). A matching `referenceDocs[]` filename may relocate the index within that root; this registry is independent from task-specific reference-doc selection, so omitted or empty `referenceDocs` does not disable it. The index's `**Protocols directory:**` header selects a project-root-relative body directory (default `docs/project-protocols/`). Match this skill against the `Target` column and take the most specific tier ONLY — exact name > glob > `*`. **That precedence orders overlays against EACH OTHER, never against this skill.** Read only matched bodies derived as `<protocols-dir>/<Name>.md`; the row's Body link is display text, never a read path. Reject unsafe paths without reading. A matched body that is missing or malformed is REPORTED and skipped — never reconstructed from the index Description. An absent index or no match -> proceed with no overlay, silently. Full contract: `.claude/skills/project-skill-protocol/references/registry.md`.
>
> Overlays are **ADDITIVE ONLY**: they ADD rules on top of this skill's own protocol and NEVER replace, override, disable, or reinterpret a rule it already states — removing every overlay must return this skill to exactly its documented behavior. An overlay is a BRIEF, not an authority escalation: it can NEVER waive a workflow gate, git discipline, a review gate, or a user-confirmation gate. A genuine overlay-vs-skill conflict, or two equally-specific overlays that directly contradict -> surface both to the user; NEVER resolve silently.

Read ONLY matched bodies from the directory the index header names (default `docs/project-protocols/`). Specificity (exact > glob > `*`) ranks overlays against EACH OTHER, never against the skill. Missing/malformed body → report and skip; no index or no match → proceed silently. Overlays are ADDITIVE ONLY — never an authority escalation or a gate waiver; equal-tier contradiction goes to the user.
<!-- /SYNC:project-protocol-overlay:reminder -->

## Closing Reminders

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION Goal:** Force every assumption-laden plan decision and every preservation-critical behavior through explicit user confirmation BEFORE implementation — by interviewing the user with critical questions that validate assumptions and surface issues — so no unstated assumption silently reaches code.

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION Main steps:** detect plan type → resolve the plan and applicability gate → read plan/phase files → extract decision topics → ask bounded user questions → document confirmed answers → offer implement/refine/skip.

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION Applicability:** validate the embedded decomposition/slice evidence, explicit roadmap milestone chain, framework technical evidence, or EXEMPT reason/owner plus non-goals, definitions, scenario proof where applicable, skeleton/commands, redacted evidence, and human approval before offering implementation; unresolved intent or evidence is BLOCKED.

**Protocols in force (concise digest of the SYNC/shared blocks this skill carries):**

- **Nested Task Creation:** child skill still creates visible phase tasks; link parent when nested.
- **Task Tracking & External Report:** bootstrap task breakdown first; persist findings incrementally to `tmp/reports/`.
- **Critical Thinking:** MUST ATTENTION apply critical + sequential thinking; cite proof; confidence >80% to act.
- **Sequential Thinking:** structured multi-step Thought N/M with REVISION/BRANCH/HYPOTHESIS markers and confidence closer.
- **Project Reference Docs:** read required project-reference docs before target work; always include `lessons.md`.
- **Understand Code First:** MUST ATTENTION read code and grep 3+ patterns before any modification.
- **Plan Quality:** include `## Test Specifications` with TC-{FEATURE}-{NNN} IDs per phase.
- **Cross-Service Check:** scan producers, consumers, sagas, contracts; flag breaking-change risk.
- **AI Mistake Prevention:** verify generated content against evidence, trace downstream references, verify all affected outputs, re-read after context loss, surface ambiguity.

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** run the main steps IN ORDER — Phase 0 Detect Plan Type → resolve plan path → load `mode` + `questions` range → Phase 0.5 Product Readiness / Plan Gate → Step 1 Read `plan.md` + all `phase-*.md` (flag decisions/assumptions/risks/tradeoffs) → Step 2 Extract topics (9 categories) → Step 3 Generate questions (2-4 options each) → Step 4 Interview by asking the user directly (≤4 per call) → Step 5 Document answers → offer implement/refine/skip — why: the pipeline IS the work; never collapse or skip a step from memory

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** validate decisions with the user by asking the user directly — NEVER auto-decide or self-answer; completing without ≥1 question is a protocol violation — why: the user owns every assumption-laden choice, not the agent
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** detect plan type FIRST (Phase 0) BEFORE generating questions — bugfix keywords (fix, bug, regression, broken, defect) make the Preservation question BLOCKING, never skipped — why: detection drives which categories fire and the Preservation gate
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** NEVER modify phase files — persist results by adding ONLY a `## Validation Summary` (confirmed decisions + action items) to `plan.md` — why: phase files are the plan's source of truth and validation is a read-then-annotate pass

- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** break work into small todo tasks using task tracking BEFORE starting (including a task per file read); call the current task list first on context loss, never duplicate — why: resume existing tasks rather than re-plan after compaction
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** honor the `questions` MIN-MAX range and `mode` from `## Plan Context` as hard constraints; give 2-4 concrete options per question, never go below min — why: the interview budget is configured, not improvised
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** treat the Preservation "Unsure" answer as BLOCKED → return BLOCKED status and route to `$plan` preservation analysis before any implementation — why: an unverified preserved-correctness invariant is a silent regression risk
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** if the plan introduces new tech/packages, probe whether alternatives were evaluated before accepting the choice — why: unevaluated dependency choices raise future change cost
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** cite `file:line` proof or traced evidence with confidence % for every claim (>80% act, <80% verify first); admit uncertainty rather than present a guess as fact — why: speculation drives wrong validation questions
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** search 3+ existing patterns and read the plan + phase files BEFORE generating questions — match the codebase's local conventions over generic framework defaults — why: questions grounded in actual code surface real decisions, not invented ones
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** apply the Easy-to-Change lens before any rule below — flag decisions that raise future change cost (coupling, hidden state, duplicated knowledge, unclear intent, irreversible early choices)
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** add a final review task to verify work quality

**Anti-Rationalization:**

| Evasion                            | Rebuttal                                                            |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "Plan is simple, skip validation"  | Simple plans still have implicit decisions. Apply anyway.           |
| "Already know the answers"         | Show user responses as proof. No responses = no validation.         |
| "Preservation doesn't apply here"  | If title has fix/bug/regression/broken/defect → ALWAYS applies.     |
| "Phase 0 not needed"               | Detection drives the Preservation gate. NEVER skip.                 |
| "Only ask a few questions"         | Use the `questions` range from Plan Context. Never go below min.    |
| "I'll just answer for the user"    | ask the user directly is mandatory. Self-answer = no validation.        |
| "New library is obviously fine"    | Probe whether alternatives were evaluated before accepting it.      |
| "I'll edit the phase files inline" | NEVER. Add only a `## Validation Summary` to `plan.md`.             |

**[TASK-PLANNING]** Before acting, analyze task scope and systematically break it into small todo tasks and sub-tasks using task tracking.

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** detect plan type (Phase 0) FIRST — bugfix keywords make Preservation BLOCKING.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** validate with the user by asking the user directly — NEVER auto-decide.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** NEVER modify phase files — add only a `## Validation Summary` to `plan.md`.

## SYNC:ai-sdd-artifact-contract:reminder

- **MANDATORY** Apply `shared/sdd-artifact-contract.md`; keep reusable AI-SDD in `.claude` and local rules in project docs.
- **MANDATORY** Resolve and validate `specArtifacts`: use valid native owner/case/variant identity and assertion-bearing evidence; use strict-default TC/TestSpec only when the profile is absent; block a malformed or unsupported declaration without fallback.
- **MANDATORY** Code-to-spec extraction is reference-only until canonical acceptance; any supported AI tool may execute with synced context.
- **MANDATORY** Update `.claude` source before syncing generated mirrors; do not manually edit `.agents`, `.codex`, or `AGENTS.md`.
- **MANDATORY** Missing or stale project config, root instruction files, or required reference docs route project-specific work through `$project-init` or the narrow setup route automatically.
**[TASK-PLANNING] [MANDATORY]** BEFORE executing any workflow or skill step, create/update task tracking for all planned steps, analyze the task graph (output dependencies, shared write targets) into ordered parallel waves per PARALLELIZE before starting any task, then keep it synchronized as each step starts/completes. Preserve fixed ordering when a skill or workflow explicitly fixes it.
- **MANDATORY** Pin `Original goal:` before the first action and keep `User prompts this session: P1…Pn` current; re-read both at every step, before delegation, and after compaction.
- **MANDATORY** Before claiming done, map the result to the original goal and every prompt (`P# → done | deferred | n/a`); never store secrets in them.
## [LESSON-LEARNED-REMINDER] [BLOCKING] Task Planning & Continuous Improvement — MANDATORY. Do not skip.

Break work into small tasks (task tracking) before starting. Add final task: "Analyze AI mistakes & lessons learned".

**Extract lessons — ROOT CAUSE ONLY, not symptom fixes:**
1. Name the FAILURE MODE (reasoning/assumption failure), not symptom — "assumed API existed without reading source" not "used wrong enum value".
2. Generality test: does this failure mode apply to ≥3 contexts/codebases? If not, abstract one level up.
3. Write as a universal rule — strip project-specific names/paths/classes. Useful on any codebase.
4. Consolidate: multiple mistakes sharing one failure mode → ONE lesson.
5. **Recurrence gate:** "Would this recur in future session WITHOUT this reminder?" — No → skip `$learn`.
6. **Auto-fix gate:** "Could `$code-review`/`$code-simplifier`/`$security-review`/a linter catch this?" — Yes → improve review skill instead.
7. BOTH gates pass → ask user to run `$learn`.
**[CRITICAL-THINKING-MINDSET]** Apply critical thinking, sequential thinking. Every claim needs traced proof, confidence >80% to act.
**Anti-hallucination principle:** Never present guess as fact — cite sources for every claim, admit uncertainty freely, self-check output for errors, cross-reference independently, stay skeptical of own confidence — certainty without evidence root of all hallucination.
**AI Attention principle (Primacy-Recency):** Put the 3 most critical rules at both top and bottom of long prompts/protocols so instruction adherence survives long context windows.
**Goal-driven execution:** Define success criteria first, loop until verified, and stop only when observable checks pass.
**Tests verify intent:** Tests must protect business rules/invariants and fail when the protected intent breaks, not only mirror current behavior.
**Judgement integrity:** For theory checks, judgements, evaluations and gap hunts, the prompt's premise is a hypothesis — test it AND its opposite with one evidence bar (web-verify external facts), why-review the draft as an inline self-check (run the `why-review` skill only for a formal review/audit/gap-hunt deliverable or a MEDIUM+/consequential issue the inline pass cannot settle), never invent findings or manufacture disagreement ("no material issues" is a valid verdict); end with a `Bias check:` line (`SYNC:judgement-integrity`).
## Common AI Mistake Prevention (System Lessons)

- **Resolve project applicability before using framework examples.** Read the project config and relevant references, then inspect local evidence; honor explicit N/A and never impose a language, framework, architecture layer, styling method, tool, or runtime surface the project does not use.
- **ROOT-CAUSE GATE — INVESTIGATE FIRST.** Before applying any project-related correction, always use the project's root-cause investigation protocol and establish the cause; the failure site may be only a symptom.
- **FAILED-TEST GATE.** For any failed or unstable test, use the project's test-investigation protocol before editing source or tests; never change either side merely to force green.
- **Re-read files after context compaction.** Edit requires prior Read in same context; compaction wipes read state. Re-read before editing.
- **Grep for old terms after bulk replacements.** AI over-trusts find/replace completeness. Grep full repo after bulk edits for missed refs in docs/configs/catalogs.
- **Check downstream references before deleting.** Deletions cascade doc/code staleness. Map referencing files before removal.
- **After memory loss, check existing state before creating new.** Compaction wipes prior-work memory. Query current state to resume — never blindly duplicate.
- **Verify AI-generated content against actual code.** AI hallucinates APIs, class names, method signatures. Grep to confirm existence before documenting/referencing.
- **Trace full dependency chain after edits.** Changing a definition misses downstream consumers. Trace the full chain.
- **When renaming, grep ALL consumer file types.** Some file types silently ignore missing refs (no compile error). Search code, templates, configs, generated files.
- **Trace ALL code paths when verifying correctness.** Code existing ≠ code executing. Trace early exits, error branches, conditional skips — not just happy path.
- **Update docs that embed canonical data when source changes.** Docs inlining derived data (workflows, schemas, configs) go stale silently. Update all embedding docs alongside source.
- **Verify sub-agent results after context recovery.** Background agents may finish while parent compacted — grep-verify output, don't trust assumed completion.
- **Cross-check full target list against sub-agent assignments.** Parallel sub-agents by category miss boundary items. Reconcile union of assignments against target list before proceeding.
- **Sub-agents inherit knowledge only from their agent .md definition — use custom agent types, not built-in Explore.** Tool adoption = permission + knowledge + enforcement (numbered workflow step).
- **Persist sub-agent findings incrementally, not as a final batch.** Long sub-agents hit cutoffs before final write — findings lost. Instruct append-per-section to report file.
- **Ownership before action.** When investigating a failure, ask which part owns the behavior before changing anything. Trace the wrong state to the component responsible for its invariant, then make one authoritative correction there.
- **Test failure → record a provisional verdict before trace/edit, then investigate.** Use the full five-way taxonomy: SOURCE-WRONG (production violates intent), TEST-WRONG (assertion/setup is stale), TEST-NOT-OPTIMAL (valid but fragile or low-signal test), ENVIRONMENT-BLOCKED (external state prevents a verdict), or AMBIGUOUS (intent/evidence cannot choose safely). Then trace root cause and triangulate against the governing spec if one exists (the business spec root — default `docs/specs`; a `specRoots.business.path` entry in `docs/project-config.json` overrides the path) AND source. NEVER weaken an assertion, add a skip, relax a timeout, or change source merely to force green.
- **Grep ALL removed names after extraction/refactoring.** Primary file "done" ≠ secondary files clean. Grep entire scope for every removed symbol before declaring complete.
- **Assume existing values are intentional — ask WHY before changing OR flagging one as a defect.** Pattern-matching as "wrong" skips context. Before changing or reporting any constant/limit/flag/cutoff: read comments, git blame, the CALLER's ordering (the guarantee that makes the value correct usually lives in code running immediately BEFORE the cited line), and 2+ sibling call sites of the same convention. A doc stating WHAT without WHY is missing rationale, not proof of a missing guard — and in a validation pass, an accurate `file:line` citation proves the transcription, never the defect.
- **Verify ALL affected outputs, not just the first.** One build green ≠ all green. Multi-stack changes (backend/frontend/tests/docs) require verifying EVERY output.
- **Evaluate fit before copying a nearby pattern.** Closest example ≠ matching preconditions — verify the new context shares the same constraints, base classes, scope, lifetime.
- **Holistic analysis — resist the nearest-attention trap.** Do not dive into the first plausible cause. List every precondition (configuration, environment, inputs, dependencies, versions, permissions, and state). Verify each against evidence, not intuition. Ask "what would falsify this?" — if nothing, it is not a hypothesis. The most expensive failure is going deeper into an assumed area while the real issue sits in an unexamined condition.
- **Minimal changes — apply the relevance test.** Every change must trace to the reported problem; avoid unrelated cleanup. For review or enhancement work, announce improvements beyond the main request rather than silently expanding scope. Ask: "Would this change exist if I were not addressing this request?" — if not, remove it or disclose it.
- **Surface ambiguity before coding — don't pick silently.** Multiple valid interpretations → present each with effort: "[Request] could mean (1) [N h], (2) [N h]. Which matters?" List scope/format/volume/constraints assumptions first. If simpler path exists, say so. Never silently pick.
- **Why-Review adversarial mindset — apply when reviewing any plan, decision, or design.** Default SKEPTIC not VALIDATOR: steel-man a rejected alternative, invert each stated reason ("what does it sacrifice?"), stress-test top 2-3 assumptions, run pre-mortem ("ships, fails in 3 months — what breaks?"), surface 1-2 alternatives author missed. Section presence ≠ quality; quality = causal reasoning + concrete mitigations + evidence, not "it's better" or "monitor closely".
- **Front-load report-write in sub-agent prompts for large reviews.** Many-file sub-agents hit budget before final write — findings lost. Design prompts so: (1) report-write is first explicit deliverable, (2) append per-file/section (not batched), (3) scope bounded so reads don't exhaust budget. Truncated mid-sentence with no report file → spawn narrower scope, don't retry same prompt.
- **After context compaction, re-verify all prior phase outcomes before continuing.** Summaries describe intent, not environment state (git index, filesystem, processes). On resume, FIRST audit: git status, re-read modified files, verify filesystem. Every "completed" claim is an untested hypothesis until evidence confirms.
- **OOM/memory: check row count before row size.** Triage: (1) Unbounded query — no DB filter for trigger? Push filter to DB; eliminates OOM. (2) Large rows? Projection reduces proportionally. Row reduction > projection in ROI.
- **Assert the outcome your system OWNS, never the intermediate state your INFRASTRUCTURE owns.** When testing anything asynchronous (queue/broker delivery, retries, background jobs, caches, replication), assert the final business/entity state. NEVER assert the delivery bookkeeping — consume/send status, attempt counts, last-error, row existence or counts in a broker, scheduler, or outbox/inbox table. That bookkeeping lives in shared infrastructure that ANY co-running process (a peer worker, a second replica, a leftover local container) can write, usually under a deterministic shared key, so the assertion silently tests the developer's environment instead of the system: green when run alone, flaky the instant anything else shares that broker + database. Gate question for every assertion: "would this hold no matter WHICH process did the work?" — if no, assert the converged data state instead. Corollary: process-local fault injection and in-process telemetry cannot gate work any process may perform — use them as stress amplifiers (arm → bounded window → disarm → assert convergence), never as preconditions.
- **Store disposable generated output in the project workspace.** If an output can be regenerated and is not source code, a canonical source-of-truth, or an intentionally versioned projection, write it under the project-root `tmp/` or `temp/` directory (prefer `tmp/`), scoped to the run. This includes temporary state, integration/E2E results, reports, logs, screenshots, traces, videos, coverage, dumps, and candidate evidence. Never put these outputs in source, docs, the plans root (default `plans/`; a `docsRoots.plans.path` entry in `docs/project-config.json` overrides the path), the team-artifacts root (default `team-artifacts/`; `docsRoots.teamArtifacts.path` in the same config overrides the path), or mirror directories; the project-root `.gitignore` must ignore `/tmp/` and `/temp/` by default. Committed fixtures, accepted baselines, canonical specs/docs, and explicitly versioned generated mirrors remain at their declared owner paths.
- **Judge the environment before judging the code — a competing hypothesis, not a fallback.** A bug, failed test, error, or odd output is NOT proof of a code defect. Before deep tracing and before any verdict, sweep environment preconditions (toolchain/dependency/lockfile state, stale build or cache artifacts, env vars and config profile, service dependencies up-migrated-seeded, ports/network/clock, OS-path/locale, permissions and locks, leftover processes/containers/test data) AND transient resource pressure (RAM/OOM, CPU saturation under parallel workers, disk/temp exhaustion, handle and connection-pool limits, network flakiness, a timeout that is really slowness). Tell-tale shape: non-deterministic, timing-dependent, passes alone but fails in parallel, fails only on one machine or only on CI, or an error naming resources rather than business rules. Cite the discriminator you ran (clean environment? did code on the failing path change since it last passed? one machine or all? concurrency 1 or a clean rebuild?) — a verdict without one is a guess, for code as much as for the environment. Fix an environment cause in the environment or setup; NEVER edit product code or weaken/skip a test to absorb it, and a failure that vanishes on retry stays unexplained until its mechanism is named. — why: forcing green against an environment fault hides the real defect and permanently rots the test.
- **Cross-platform execution is a required contract.** Before authoring or changing a tool, script, process launcher, path assertion, or filesystem test, name the supported Windows, macOS, and Linux behaviors. Use platform-neutral Node APIs and literal argv vectors; never infer shell, temporary-path, executable-extension, ACL, or symlink semantics from the current host. A documented command, entry point, or wrapper script gives its Windows, macOS, and Linux form (Python: `py -3` on Windows, `python3` on macOS/Linux; shell: PowerShell/`.cmd` beside POSIX `sh`) or one platform-neutral runner such as `node <script>` — a single-OS example is an incomplete protocol. Canonicalize existing paths before identity, hashing, or equality checks; test native Windows and POSIX seams when behavior differs; keep CI platform matrices authoritative. Preserve fail-closed security boundaries — repair the fixture or platform branch, never weaken the guard just to make one OS green.
- **Keep domain concepts out of generic/shared/infrastructure layers.** Reusable layer (shared library, framework, infra module) must reference NO consumer-specific domain concept — tenant/customer/product IDs, business entities, feature rules. Leak compiles + runs → passes review silently while coupling the "reusable" layer to one consumer. Keep shared type domain-free; push domain fields/logic down into the consumer via subclass/composition. — why: a layer coupled to one consumer's domain is no longer reusable.
