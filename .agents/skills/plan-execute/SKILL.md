## Codex Project-Reference Loading (Hook-Independent)

Claude and Codex use static project-reference loading as the authority; hooks may accelerate discovery but never replace the explicit read.
When coding, planning, debugging, testing, or reviewing, open project docs explicitly using this routing.

**Always read:**
- `docs/project-config.json` (project-specific paths, commands, modules, and workflow/test settings)
- `docs/project-reference/docs-index-reference.md` (routes to the full `docs/project-reference/*` catalog)
- `docs/project-reference/lessons.md` (always-on guardrails and anti-patterns)

**Missing/stale context route:** If `docs/project-config.json`, the docs index, `lessons.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, or any task-required reference doc is missing or stale, auto-run `$project-init` or the narrow setup route (`$project-config`, `$docs-init`, `$scan-all`, `$scan --target=<key>`, `$claude-md-init`) before ordinary project-specific work. If Codex mirrors or `AGENTS.md` are missing/stale, ask the user to run `$sync-codex`; do not auto-run it.

**Situation-based docs:**
- Project structure/architecture/tech-stack/deployment/setup (any layer — backend, frontend, or infra): `project-structure-reference.md`
- Backend/CQRS/API/domain/entity changes: `backend-patterns-reference.md`, `domain-entities-reference.md`
- Frontend/UI/styling/design-system: `frontend-patterns-reference.md`, `scss-styling-guide.md`, `design-system/README.md`
- Spec authoring, `docs/specs/` pathing, or TC format: `feature-spec-reference.md`, `spec-system-reference.md`, `spec-principles.md`
- Behavior/public-contract changes or spec-test-code sync: `workflow-spec-test-code-cycle-reference.md` plus the spec docs above
- Derived spec indexes/ERDs/reimplementation guides: `spec-system-reference.md` and source Feature Specs under `docs/specs/`
- Integration test implementation/review: `integration-test-reference.md`
- E2E test implementation/review: `e2e-test-reference.md`
- Code review/audit work: `code-review-rules.md` plus domain docs above based on changed files

Do not read all docs blindly. Start from `docs-index-reference.md`, then open only relevant files for the task.

## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Complete the selected plan phase as working, fully-tested, reviewed, user-approved code through its testing, code review, and approval gates. Git operations are optional and require an explicit user request — NEVER bypass a quality or authority gate to declare done.

**Summary:**

- **Purpose:** consume an EXISTING plan, one phase per run — Step 0 detects `plans/*.md` + selects the next incomplete phase (prefer IN_PROGRESS, else earliest Planned). Use `$feature-implement` instead when no plan exists yet — it creates plans, this consumes them.
- **Ordered execution anchor (run in declared order; emit `✓ Step N:` each):** Step 0 detect/select the plan → Step 1 read the plan fully, read the Goal Contract and Trace Gate, seed task tracking 0–6 → Step 2 implement step-by-step (type-check + compile; UI → `ui-ux-designer`) → Step 3 test (`tester` → `debugger` until 100%) → Step 4 review (`code-reviewer` until the current severity bar is clear: round 1 zero findings, round 2+ zero CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM with LOW deferred) → Step 5 explicit user approval (BLOCKING — stop and wait) → Step 6 finalize (`project-manager` + `docs-manager` status/docs; optional `git-manager` only for an explicit user request).
- **Three BLOCKING gates cannot be faked-green:** Step 3 tests 100% pass, Step 4 has no blocking finding under the current round bar (round 1: no finding; round 2+: no CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM; failed binary gates always block), Step 5 explicit user approval before Finalize. These gates never grant Git authority. — why: quality acceptance and operation authority protect different boundaries.
- **Two STOP-before-coding gates:** Pre-Implementation Granularity Gate (refuse planning verbs / unnamed files / unresolved decisions → sub-plan with `$plan`) + bugfix Trace Gate (require the End→Start debugger trace for any bug/regression/behavior-changing plan). Also the Spec-Loop Gate (property TC + mutation-killed test + Dual-Feedback) closes any behavior change.
- **Step 2 is SEQUENTIAL by default; wave fan-out is OPT-IN.** `--parallel` / `--parallel=on` dispatches disjoint-write-set phases as one wave of `fullstack-developer` subagents in ONE message, barrier, then recomputes the next wave against the updated repo. `--parallel=auto` fans out ONLY when every in-scope phase carries the `## Parallel Execution` block (`PAR`/`SEQ` tag + declared write set) written by `$plan` — no block, no fan-out.
- **Mode flags** add/remove ONE step, never relax a running gate: `--approval=off` (auto/trust, skip Step 5, optional `$ALL_PHASES` loop over every incomplete phase), `--tests=off` (skip Step 3), `--parallel={auto|on|off}` (`off` default = sequential; bare `--parallel`/`on` opts in to wave dispatch; `auto` fans out only on plan-declared `PAR`/`SEQ` metadata). No flags = full 7-step spine, run sequentially.
- **Standalone** (no parent `[Workflow]` row via the current task list) → wrap the spine in plan → plan-review → proceed → `$changes-review` → `$why-review`, the two reviews as the LAST todos.

> **Slash-command routing:** `/code`, `/code-auto`, `/code-no-test`, `/code-parallel` no longer resolve — use `$plan-execute` with the matching flag: `/code-auto` → `--approval=off`, `/code-no-test` → `--tests=off`, `/code-parallel` → `--parallel`.

**Workflow:**

0. **Plan Detection** — Find latest plan or use provided path, select next incomplete phase
1. **Analysis & Tasks** — Read the phase file fully and extract tasks into task tracking
2. **Implementation** — Implement step-by-step, run type checks
3. **Testing** — Call tester subagent; must reach 100% pass before proceeding
4. **Code Review** — Call code-reviewer subagent; must clear the current severity bar: Round 1 has zero validated findings of any severity; Round 2+ has zero validated CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM findings, with LOW findings recorded/deferred. Failed binary gates always block.
5. **User Approval** — BLOCKING gate: wait for explicit user approval
6. **Finalize** — Update status/docs, report implementation complete; optionally handle an explicit Git request

**Key Rules:**

- Tests must be 100% passing (Step 3 gate)
- No blocking findings under the current Step 4 review bar (Round 1: all severities; Round 2+: CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM; binary gates always block)
- User must explicitly approve before finalize (Step 5 gate)
- Implementation completion, review approval, and `--approval=off` never authorize staging, committing, or pushing. Dispatch Git only with `operation`, `scope`, and `sourceRequest` from an explicit user request; NEVER `git commit --amend`.
- One plan phase per command run — a multi-phase run requires `--approval=off` with `$ALL_PHASES=Yes`
- Phases run sequentially unless fan-out is explicitly opted in; even then, two phases writing the same file NEVER share a wave
- **Mode flags** (see [Mode Flags](#mode-flags)): `--approval=off` (auto/trust, no approval gate + optional all-phases loop), `--tests=off` (skip the test step), `--parallel={auto|on|off}` (default `off` = sequential; `on` = opt in to wave dispatch; `auto` = fan out only when the plan declares `PAR`/`SEQ` tags + write sets). No flags = full 7-step spine below, run sequentially.

**MUST ATTENTION READ** `CLAUDE.md` then **THINK HARDER** to start working on the following plan:

**Be skeptical. Apply critical thinking, sequential thinking. Every claim needs traced proof, confidence percentages (Idea should be more than 80%).**

<plan>$ARGUMENTS</plan>

---

> **plan-execute vs feature-implement:** `plan-execute` **executes an EXISTING plan** phase-by-phase (Step 0 detects `plans/*.md`) and owns the back of the pipeline — phase gates, completion reporting, optional explicitly requested Git operations, and the `--parallel`/`--approval`/`--tests` flags. Use `$feature-implement` instead when you have only a feature description and need research + planning done first. feature-implement creates plans; plan-execute consumes them.

## Standalone Mode Pipeline (skip entirely if invoked inside a workflow)

> **MANDATORY — standalone `$plan-execute` only.** When this skill is invoked OUTSIDE a workflow, wrap the core spine (Steps 0-6) in this quality loop. Detect an active workflow via the current task list FIRST: if a parent `[Workflow]` row exists, SKIP this section — the surrounding workflow already sequences plan/review/why-review (e.g. `workflow-refactor`).
>
> Create these as task tracking tasks up front, in order, then execute them:
>
> 1. **`$plan`** — if Step 0 finds no plan for the request, author one first. If a plan already exists, record that and skip to step 2.
> 2. **`$plan-review`** — recursively review/validate the plan; fix validated findings that block the current severity bar before proceeding.
> 3. **Proceed** — run the core spine (Steps 0-6) against the approved plan.
> 4. **`$changes-review`** — review the diff before commit (the post-gate; see *Standalone Review Gate* below).
> 5. **`$why-review`** — review rationale and change quality of the implementation.
>
> This is the single pre+post quality loop for standalone runs.

## Mode Flags

`$plan-execute` runs the full step spine below by default. Optional flags adapt the spine for the cases formerly served by dedicated skills — each flag only adds or removes a single step against the **host step numbering** (Step 3 Testing, Step 4 Code Review, Step 5 User Approval, Step 6 Finalize); the shared spine and every quality bar are otherwise unchanged.

| Flag | Default | Effect |
| ---- | ------- | ------ |
| `--approval={on\|off}` | `on` | `off` = **trust/auto mode**: skip the Step 5 implementation-approval blocking gate and finalize without waiting; never grants Git authority. Pair with `$ALL_PHASES` to run every incomplete phase in one pass. |
| `--tests={on\|off}` | `on` | `off` = skip the Step 3 Testing gate entirely (Implementation → Code Review → Approval → Finalize only). Use ONLY when the plan explicitly defers tests. |
| `--parallel={auto\|on\|off}` | `off` | `off` = **default**: implement every phase sequentially in the main agent. `on` (also bare `--parallel`) = **explicit opt-in**: Step 2 groups disjoint-write-set phases into waves of `fullstack-developer` subagents with strict file-ownership boundaries; the user has accepted the risk, and YOU must still name every phase's write set — including its cascade/generated writes — before grouping. `auto` = **metadata-gated**: fan out only when every in-scope phase carries a `## Parallel Execution` block (`PAR`/`SEQ` tag + declared write set) written by `$plan`; absent that block, fall back to sequential — NEVER derive write sets optimistically. |

**`$ALL_PHASES` (only meaningful with `--approval=off`):** `Yes` (default in auto mode) processes ALL incomplete phases in one run, auto-looping to the next phase after each Finalize; `No` implements one phase then asks before continuing. With `--approval=on` (default), always one phase per run — so cross-phase wave dispatch is only ever reachable in a multi-phase run (`--approval=off` + `$ALL_PHASES=Yes`) or on a phase whose sub-phases are independently implementable.

### Flag-modified step behavior

- **`--parallel=auto` → Step 2 (Implementation):** metadata-gated fan-out — dispatch waves ONLY when every in-scope phase carries a `## Parallel Execution` block written by `$plan`; the moment one phase lacks it, the whole run reverts to sequential. `auto` NEVER derives a write set from the plan's prose — see [Step 2 Wave Dispatch](#step-2-wave-dispatch-opt-in---parallelon).
- **`--parallel` / `--parallel=on` → Step 2:** the explicit opt-in — dispatch waves even when the plan declares no `PAR`/`SEQ` tags or `## Execution Waves` line. You MUST first derive each phase's write set yourself from its `Related Code Files` / Implementation Steps **and** from the generated/mirrored artifacts those edits cascade into; a phase whose write set you cannot name stays out of the wave. Colliding phases still go in different waves — opting in never authorizes co-scheduling two writers of one file.
- **`--parallel=off` (DEFAULT) → Step 2:** no wave dispatch; implement every phase sequentially in the main agent. This is the normal path and needs no justification — no flag is required to stay sequential. All gates and quality bars unchanged.
- **`--tests=off` → Step 3 (Testing):** Skip entirely. Proceed Implementation → Code Review. The Source/test drift check still applies to any tests that already exist. Keep existing tests real and genuinely passing — NEVER comment out tests, weaken assertions, or use fake data to make them pass — why: faked green hides the regression the test exists to catch.
- **`--approval=off` → Step 5 (User Approval):** Skip the implementation-approval blocking gate. Finalize (status, docs, completion report) runs once Steps 1-4 pass; this flag never grants Git authority. When `$ALL_PHASES=Yes`, loop back to Step 0 for the next incomplete phase; on the last phase, generate the summary report and ask about `/preview`.

> **Behavior preserved:** the debugger-trace gate, granularity gate, testing/review quality bars, and all SYNC blocks apply in EVERY mode. Flags change *which gates run*, never *how rigorously a running gate is enforced*.

---

## Pre-Implementation Granularity Gate (MANDATORY)

<HARD-GATE>

If ANY check fails → STOP. Ask user: "Phase needs more detail before implementation. Refine with $plan? [Y/n]"
Implement only phases with named files, concrete actions, and resolved decisions — DO NOT implement a phase containing planning verbs, unnamed files, or unresolved decisions.
</HARD-GATE>

---

## Step 0: Plan Detection & Phase Selection

**If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty:**

1. Find latest `plan.md` in `./plans`
2. Parse plan for phases and status, auto-select next incomplete (prefer IN_PROGRESS or earliest Planned)

**If `$ARGUMENTS` provided:** Use that plan and detect which phase to work on.

**Output:** `✓ Step 0: [Plan Name] - [Phase Name]`

---

## Workflow Sequence

**Rules:** Follow steps 1-6 in order. Each step requires output marker `✓ Step N:`. Mark each complete in task tracking before proceeding. Do not skip steps.

---

## Step 1: Analysis & Task Extraction

Read plan file completely. Map dependencies. List ambiguities. Identify required skills and activate from catalog. If the plan references analysis files in `tmp/analysis/`, re-read them before implementation.

**Goal Contract read (BEFORE any code change):** resolve the active Goal Contract per `SYNC:goal-contract-satisfaction-loop` — active plan `goal.md` → `plans/goals/{YYMMDD-HHmm}-{slug}/goal.md` → create from the current request via `.claude/templates/goal-contract-template.md` — and read its saved success criteria. After implementation/verification (Step 3+), append an Iteration Log entry with evidence and remaining gaps.

**Pre-Implementation Trace Gate:** If the plan is for a bugfix, failed verification, stale/incorrect final output, regression, or behavior-changing fix, MUST ATTENTION verify the plan or referenced analysis includes `Debugger Trace: End -> Start`, all feeder paths, hypothesis matrix, owning fix layer, and forward convergence proof. If missing, STOP and report the missing trace links instead of implementing.

**task tracking Initialization:**

- Initialize task tracking with `Step 0: [Plan Name] - [Phase Name]` and all steps (1-6)
- Read phase file, look for tasks/steps/phases/sections/numbered/bulleted lists
- Convert to task tracking tasks with UNIQUE names:
    - Phase Implementation tasks → Step 2.X (Step 2.1, Step 2.2, etc.)
    - Phase Testing tasks → Step 3.X
    - Phase Code Review tasks → Step 4.X

**Output:** `✓ Step 1: Found [N] tasks across [M] phases - Ambiguities: [list or "none"]`

---

## Step 2: Implementation

Implement selected plan phase step-by-step following extracted tasks. Mark tasks complete as done. UI work → call `ui-ux-designer` subagent. Run type check + compile to verify.

**UI phases carry the design brief (`DD-1`–`DD-3`).** Before implementing — or briefing a sub-agent for — any phase that creates or reshapes a user-facing surface, read the phase file's `## UI Layout` → `### Design Plan` and the project's design-system / SCSS / token docs, and construct the surface to that plan: its palette, families, scale, alignment, and named memorable element. Pass the plan verbatim into any sub-agent brief (per `.claude/skills/shared/sub-agent-selection-guide.md`) — a leaf agent inherits nothing from this conversation. **If the phase has no Design Plan and the surface is new, do NOT improvise one silently:** state that the plan is missing, propose the four parts, and confirm before proceeding. Values land as tokens, never raw hex or magic numbers.

### Step 2 Wave Dispatch (opt-in — `--parallel=on`)

Fan-out is OFF unless opted in. Run this section only when BOTH hold: (a) this run covers more than one phase (`$ALL_PHASES=Yes`, or a phase whose sub-phases are independently implementable), AND (b) the user passed `--parallel` / `--parallel=on`, or passed `--parallel=auto` and every in-scope phase carries a `## Parallel Execution` block. Either condition unmet → implement sequentially. Sequential is the safe default and needs no justification.

1. **Take the write set of every in-scope phase from the plan's declaration** — its `## Parallel Execution` block (Mode · Write set · Wave · SEQ dependency) written by `$plan`. Under `--parallel=auto` that block is MANDATORY: a plan lacking it falls back to sequential, and you NEVER reconstruct a write set from `Related Code Files` / Implementation Steps — why: a derived write set structurally cannot see cascade or generated writes, so two phases editing different source files can both write the same generated/mirrored/catalog/lockfile artifact that neither phase would ever name, and the wave corrupts it. Under `--parallel=on` the user has accepted that risk: derive the set yourself, then explicitly enumerate the generated, mirrored, and regenerated artifacts each phase's edits trigger and add them to that phase's write set before grouping. A phase whose write set still cannot be named is INELIGIBLE for a wave — implement it inline or send it back to `$plan`.
2. **Refuse to co-schedule two writers of the same file** — ANY path shared between two phases puts them in different waves. No "they only touch different functions" exception: the unit of ownership is the file. A phase tagged `SEQ`, or whose named dependency has not yet returned, never joins the current wave.
3. **Declare, then spawn in ONE message** — emit `Parallel plan: wave 1 = [...] · wave 2 = [...] · SEQ = [...] (reason)`, then spawn EVERY member of the wave in a single response as `fullstack-developer` subagents (UI-only phase → `ui-ux-designer`; route other specialties per `.claude/skills/shared/sub-agent-selection-guide.md`). Brief each with: its phase-file path, environment info, its EXCLUSIVE file-ownership boundary (cross-boundary edits forbidden — report the conflict instead), and its return contract.
4. **Barrier, then re-evaluate against the updated repo** — advance only after EVERY member returns. The barrier is YOUR accounting, not a signal you wait for: hold the wave's member list in the task tracker and mark each member by name as `returned` / `failed` / `timed-out` / `partial`. An unaccounted member is never dropped and never assumed successful. When every member is accounted for AND all returned cleanly, verify no file was written outside its owner's boundary, run type-check + compile on the merged result, THEN recompute the next wave against the repo as it now stands — never against the wave plan you computed before dispatch, because a returned phase can change what a later phase writes.
5. **Wave failure branch — the barrier does NOT advance on an incomplete wave.** If any member fails, times out, or returns partial work:
    - **Classify partial as FAILED.** A member reporting "mostly done", or whose evidence does not match its declared write set, counts as failed — not returned.
    - **Never let the survivors stand in for the missing member,** and never proceed to Step 3 on a wave that is not fully accounted for.
    - **Quarantine the failed member's work** — inspect exactly what it wrote, and revert its partial edits if they leave the tree uncompilable. Record the files it touched.
    - **Fall back to sequential for that phase** — merge the clean returns, restore compile-green, then re-implement the failed phase INLINE in the main agent (never re-dispatch it into another wave). A phase that also fails sequentially → STOP and report; do not carry it into the next wave.
    - **A cross-boundary write fails the whole wave** — revert the out-of-boundary edits, re-run that phase sequentially, and drop fan-out for the remainder of the run: the write-set model that authorized the wave is proven wrong.
    - **Report the failure in the Step 2 output** — a wave that fell back is never reported as a clean fan-out.
6. **Do not dispatch when the gain is not there** — a single-phase run, a one-file phase, or a wave of one implements inline (dispatch overhead > gain).

**Gates are SEQ boundaries and are never parallelized away.** Step 3 Testing, Step 4 Code Review, and the Step 5 user-approval gate run AFTER the barrier on the merged result — never concurrently with the phases they gate, and a subagent's own self-check NEVER substitutes for the host gate.

**Output:** `✓ Step 2: Implemented [N] files - [X/Y] tasks complete, compilation passed` — when waves ran, append `- waves: [w1 members] → [w2 members]`, and name any member that failed/timed-out plus the phase that fell back to sequential

---

## Step 3: Testing

Call `tester` subagent. ANY tests fail → STOP, call `debugger` subagent, fix, re-run. Repeat until 100% pass.

**Testing standards:** Unit tests may use mocks. Integration tests use test environment. Forbidden: commenting out tests, changing assertions to pass, TODO/FIXME to defer fixes.

**Output:** `✓ Step 3: Tests [X/X passed] - All requirements met`

**Validation:** If X ≠ total, Step 3 INCOMPLETE - do not proceed.

---

## Step 4: Code Review

Call `code-reviewer` subagent. If the current round has validated blocking findings, stop and fix them at the owning layer, re-run `tester`, and run a fresh full `code-reviewer` pass. Round 1 blocks on every validated severity; Round 2+ blocks only CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM, so LOW-only findings are recorded/deferred and do not reopen the cycle. Failed binary gates always block.

**Output:** `✓ Step 4: Code reviewed - blocking findings: Critical=[n] | High=[n] | Medium=[n] | Low deferred=[n] | binary gates=[n]`

**Validation:** Apply `.claude/scripts/lib/review-policy.cjs` before deciding whether to proceed. If the current round has any blocking finding, or any failed binary gate, Step 4 is INCOMPLETE — do not proceed. A Round 2+ LOW-only result is complete only when the LOWs are listed as deferred; it does not reopen the fix/review cycle.

> **Severity classification (canonical `SYNC:severity-rubric`):** CRITICAL is immediate material security/safety/authority/data-loss risk or a failed binary gate; HIGH is material correctness, contract, privacy, or authority risk; MEDIUM is a bounded but consequential edge/resilience/maintainability gap; LOW is evidenced non-blocking polish with no credible present material impact. `NOT VERIFIABLE` is unresolved evidence, not LOW; if it could affect required behavior or a binary gate it remains blocking until proved or explicitly owner-accepted with residual risk. Classify by consequence and cite `file:line`, never by effort or proximity to the round cap.

---

## Spec-Loop Gate (applies in EVERY mode, standalone included)

> **A behavior change is not "done" until the spec-loop closes** (canonical: `SYNC:spec-loop-discipline` in `.claude/skills/shared/sync-inline-versions.md`). After implementing a behavior-bearing phase, the four rules gate completion: (1) every [HARD] §4 rule / §5 invariant the phase touched has a **universally-quantified property TC** ("for ALL inputs in {domain}, {invariant} holds") + boundary counter-case, not just an example; (2) the changed core-logic line is **mutation-killed** — a surviving mutant on a changed line is a missing invariant, write the killing test (MUTATION-SCORE bar, not line-coverage %); (3) the finding fed the **Dual-Feedback Ledger** into BOTH the spec AND the tests (a blank Spec-feedback OR Test-feedback cell = INCOMPLETE), never a code-only change. A phase with a behavior change but no property TC, no mutation-killed test, and no Dual-Feedback entry is **INCOMPLETE** — re-verify the whole package (spec + tests + code, not just the diff) before reporting success.

---

## Step 5: User Approval ⏸ BLOCKING GATE

Present summary (3-5 bullets): what implemented (name the waves when Step 2 fanned out), tests passed, code review outcome.

**This gate is a SEQ boundary** — it is never merged into a wave, never delegated to a subagent, and never satisfied by "the parallel phases all reported success". Only `--approval=off` removes it.

**Ask user explicitly:** "Phase implementation complete. All tests pass, code reviewed. Approve changes?"

This approval accepts the implementation; it does not authorize staging, committing, or pushing. A separate explicit Git request may already exist in the conversation; retain its exact operation and scope without asking for it again.

**Stop and wait** - do not proceed until user responds.

**Output:** `✓ Step 5: User approved - Ready to complete`

---

## Step 6: Finalize

**Prerequisites:** Running quality gates passed; user approved in Step 5 or `--approval=off` explicitly skips that implementation-approval gate.

1. **STATUS UPDATE (one wave — PAR):** spawn `project-manager` (plan status file) and `docs-manager` (documentation) together in ONE message — disjoint write sets — and barrier on both returns before continuing.

2. **ONBOARDING CHECK:** Detect onboarding requirements + generate summary.

3. **COMPLETION REPORT:** Report implementation status, validation and docs outcomes independently of Git. Ordinary finalization writes no grant file and does not stage, commit, or push.

4. **OPTIONAL GIT REQUEST (SEQ — after the barrier and all required reviews):** Dispatch `git-manager` only when the user explicitly requested the operation. Pass `operation`, `scope`, and `sourceRequest` (the actual user message/quote authorizing that operation and scope); apply the agent's Git Request Contract. Scope names the repository and authorized files, or the remote/branch for push. Generic implementation/review approval never grants this authority. Commit permits necessary staging of those files and a new commit; push requires its own explicit request and never follows commit implicitly. Stage-only and push-only requests retain those limits. If the request is absent, skip Git and finish; if scope or sourceRequest is missing/ambiguous, report the missing input and ask only about that Git operation. Required standalone/workflow reviews still precede any requested Git operation. NEVER `git commit --amend`.

**Output:** `✓ Step 6: Finalize - Implementation complete - Status/docs updated - No Git request (skipped)`; when Git was explicitly requested, replace the last field with the observed operation result (including blocked/failed), never a presumed commit. A blocked Git operation does not erase completed implementation work.

## First Principle — Easy to Change

> **The success metric of every coding decision is _future change cost_.**
> DRY, SRP, abstraction, design patterns, naming, layering, tests — every
> technique exists to serve one goal: **making the next change cheaper**.

When evaluating code, a refactor, a test, or an abstraction, ask:
**does this make the next change cheaper or more expensive?**

- Reject "best practices" that raise change cost (premature abstraction,
  speculative generality, leaky indirection, ceremony without payoff).
- Name the real enemies in findings: **coupling, hidden state, duplicated
  knowledge, unclear intent, irreversible decisions exposed too early**.
- A simpler design that is easy to change beats a sophisticated design that
  isn't.

Apply this lens **before** invoking any specific rule, pattern, or checklist
below — if a downstream rule would raise change cost, this principle wins.

---

## Critical Enforcement Rules

**Step output format:** `✓ Step [N]: [Brief status] - [Key metrics]`

**task tracking tracking required:** Initialize at Step 0, mark each step complete before next.

**Mandatory subagent calls:** Step 3: `tester` | Step 4: `code-reviewer` | Step 6: `project-manager` AND `docs-manager`

**Conditional subagent call:** Step 6: `git-manager` only for an explicit user request with operation/scope/sourceRequest. No request means implementation can finish without Git.

**Blocking gates:**

- Step 3: Tests must be 100% passing
- Step 4: No blocking findings under the current review round bar (Round 1: all severities; Round 2+: CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM; binary gates always block)
- Step 5: User must explicitly approve

Execute every step in declared order; proceed only when validation passes and the user has approved; run one plan phase per command. Do not skip steps, proceed on failed validation, or assume approval without a user response.

---

## Workflow Recommendation

> **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION — NO EXCEPTIONS:** If you are NOT already in a workflow, you MUST ATTENTION use ask the user directly to ask the user. Do NOT judge task complexity or decide this is "simple enough to skip" — the user decides whether to use a workflow, not you:
>
> 1. **Activate `workflow-refactor` workflow** (Recommended) — investigate → plan → plan-execute → review → production-readiness-review → test → docs
> 2. **Execute `$plan-execute` directly** — run this skill standalone

## Next Steps (Standalone: MUST ATTENTION ask user by asking the user directly. Skip if inside workflow.)

**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION — NO EXCEPTIONS** after completing this skill, you MUST ATTENTION use ask the user directly to present these options. Do NOT skip because the task seems "simple" or "obvious" — the user decides:

- **"Proceed with full workflow (Recommended)"** — I'll detect the best workflow to continue from here (code implemented). This ensures review, testing, and docs steps aren't skipped.
- **"$code-simplifier"** — Simplify implementation
- **"$integration-test"** — Generate/update integration tests from test specs
- **"$workflow-review-changes"** — Review changes before commit
- **"Skip, continue manually"** — user decides

## Standalone Review Gate (Non-Workflow Only)

> **Post-gate of the [Standalone Mode Pipeline](#standalone-mode-pipeline-skip-entirely-if-invoked-inside-a-workflow).** Full standalone loop: plan → plan-review → proceed → `$changes-review` → `$why-review`; the two review steps below are its tail.
>
> **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION:** If this skill is called **outside a workflow** (standalone `$plan-execute`), you MUST ATTENTION create task tracking todo tasks for `$changes-review` then `$why-review` as the **last tasks** in your task list. This ensures all changes are reviewed before commit even without a workflow enforcing it.
>
> If already running inside a workflow (e.g., `workflow-feature`, `workflow-refactor`), skip this — the workflow sequence handles `$changes-review` at the appropriate step.

> **[IMPORTANT]** Use task tracking to break ALL work into small tasks BEFORE starting — including tasks for each file read. This prevents context loss from long files. For simple tasks, AI MUST ATTENTION ask user whether to skip.

**Prerequisites:** **MUST ATTENTION READ** before executing:

- `docs/project-reference/frontend-patterns-reference.md`
- `docs/project-reference/scss-styling-guide.md` — Styling/BEM guide (read when task involves frontend/UI)
- `docs/project-reference/design-system/README.md` — Design system tokens (read when task involves frontend/UI)
- `docs/project-reference/domain-entities-reference.md` — Domain entity catalog, relationships, cross-service sync (read when task involves business entities/models)

> **External Memory:** For complex or lengthy work (research, analysis, scan, review), write intermediate findings and final results to a report file in `tmp/reports/` — prevents context loss and serves as deliverable.

> **Evidence Gate:** MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION — every claim, finding, and recommendation requires `file:line` proof or traced evidence with confidence percentage (>80% to act, <80% must verify first).

<!-- SYNC:end-to-start-debugger-trace -->

> **End-to-Start Debugger Trace** — For non-trivial bugs, failed verification, regression fixes, behavior-changing code, or unclear code flow, start from the observed final state and walk backward before proposing a fix.
>
> 1. **Frame 0: observed end state** — Name the exact user-visible output, failing assertion, log line, persisted value, API response, rendered UI, or aggregate bucket. Record the reader/query/renderer that produced it with `file:line` evidence.
> 2. **Walk backward one hop at a time** — Trace final reader -> projection/cache/storage -> writer -> consumer/handler/job -> producer/caller -> original trigger. At every hop record: input, transformation, output, owner, and evidence.
> 3. **Enumerate all feeder paths** — Find every upstream producer/caller/event/job that can write into the final path, including retry, async, cache, background, and alternate UI/API paths. Mark each path verified, ruled out, or still unknown.
> 4. **Build the hypothesis matrix** — For each plausible cause, list evidence for, evidence against, how to reproduce/verify, blast radius, and status (`primary`, `contributing`, `ruled out`, `latent`). Do not fix until competing causes are explicitly resolved or bounded.
> 5. **Choose the owning fix layer** — Identify the invariant owner and the lowest shared point that protects all downstream consumers. A fix at the symptom site is rejected unless the symptom site owns the invariant.
> 6. **Prove convergence forward** — After choosing the fix, walk start -> end again and show how the corrected state reaches the observed final output. Map each root cause to a fix part and each fix part to a test/proof.
>
> **BLOCKED until:** final state named · backward trace written · all feeder paths enumerated · hypothesis matrix completed · owning fix layer justified · forward convergence proof mapped to tests.
>
> **NEVER:** Start at the first suspicious code path. Collapse multiple producers into one "flow". Treat duplicate symptoms as duplicate records without proving the read model. Skip ruled-out hypotheses.

>
> 1. Identify scope: file types, domain area, and operation.
> 2. **Read `docs/project-config.json` first — the project's machine-readable map.** It is the single source of truth for THIS repo (modules/paths, framework + search keywords, test/E2E/integration run-commands, design system, architecture rules, workflow patterns); ground exact paths, run-commands, and conventions on it **before investigating, planning, or coding** — never assume framework defaults (`CLAUDE.md` + reference docs are derived from it). If it — or the docs index, `lessons.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, or any required reference doc — is missing or stale, auto-run `$project-init` or the narrow route (`$project-config`, `$docs-init`, `$scan-all`, `$scan --target=<key>`, `$claude-md-init`) first; if Codex mirrors or `AGENTS.md` are stale, ask the user to run `$sync-codex` (never auto-run it).
> 3. Required docs by trigger: always `docs/project-reference/lessons.md`; doc lookup `docs-index-reference.md`; review `code-review-rules.md`; backend/CQRS/API `backend-patterns-reference.md`; domain/entity `domain-entities-reference.md`; frontend/UI `frontend-patterns-reference.md`; styles/design `scss-styling-guide.md` + `design-system/design-system-canonical.md`; integration tests `integration-test-reference.md`; E2E `e2e-test-reference.md`; feature docs/specs `feature-spec-reference.md` + `spec-system-reference.md` + `spec-principles.md`; behavior/public-contract/spec-test-code sync `workflow-spec-test-code-cycle-reference.md`; derived spec index/ERD/reimplementation guides `spec-system-reference.md` + source Feature Specs under `docs/specs/`; architecture/new area `project-structure-reference.md`.
> 4. Read every required doc, then before target work state: `Reference docs read: ... | Not applicable: ...`. After compaction, resume, delegation, or a material context change, repeat the route and restate the set; prior conversation and hook output are not proof of current loading.

<!-- SYNC:ai-mistake-prevention -->

> **AI Mistake Prevention** — Failure modes to avoid on every task:
>
> **FIX GATE — INVESTIGATE FIRST.** Before applying any project-related fix, always invoke `$investigate` or `$debug-investigate` and establish the root cause; the failure site may be only a symptom.
> **FAILED-TEST GATE.** For any failed or flaky test, `$debug-investigate` is mandatory before editing source or tests; never change either side merely to force green.
> **Re-read files after context changes.** Context compaction, resume, or long-running work can make memory stale; verify current files before acting.
> **Verify generated content against source evidence.** AI hallucinates APIs, names, claims, and document facts. Check the relevant source before documenting or referencing.
> **Check downstream references before deleting or renaming.** Removing an artifact can stale docs, generated mirrors, configs, and callers; map references first.
> **Trace the full impact chain after edits.** Changing a definition can miss derived outputs and consumers. Follow the affected chain before declaring done.
> **Verify ALL affected outputs, not just the first.** One green check is not all green checks; validate every output surface the change can affect.
> **Assume existing values are intentional — ask WHY before changing OR flagging one as a defect.** Before changing or reporting a constant, limit, flag, cutoff, wording, or pattern, read nearby context and history, the CALLER's ordering, and 2+ sibling call sites of the same convention. A doc stating WHAT without WHY is missing rationale, not proof of a missing guard.
> **Surface ambiguity before acting — don't pick silently.** Multiple valid interpretations require an explicit question or stated assumption with risk.
> **Assert the outcome your system owns, not the intermediate state your infrastructure owns.** When verifying async work, assert the final business state — never the delivery/retry bookkeeping held in shared infrastructure that any co-running process can write. Such a check passes when run alone and flakes the moment anything else shares that infrastructure.
> **Store disposable generated output in the project workspace.** If an output can be regenerated and is not source code, a canonical source-of-truth, or an intentionally versioned projection, write it under the project-root `tmp/` or `temp/` directory (prefer `tmp/`), scoped to the run. This includes temporary state, integration/E2E results, reports, logs, screenshots, traces, videos, coverage, dumps, and candidate evidence. Never put these outputs in source, docs, `plans/`, `team-artifacts/`, or mirror directories; the project-root `.gitignore` must ignore `/tmp/` and `/temp/` by default. Committed fixtures, accepted baselines, canonical specs/docs, and explicitly versioned generated mirrors remain at their declared owner paths.
> **Keep shared guidance role-relevant.** Universal guidance must help every receiving skill or agent; code-specific obligations belong only in code-specific protocols.

<!-- SYNC:design-distinctiveness-gate -->

> **[BLOCKING] Design distinctiveness gate (`DD-1`–`DD-8`) — binds on ANY task that designs, plans, mocks up, implements, or reviews a user-facing visual surface.** Deep catalog: `.claude/docs/design-knowledge.md`. Cite findings as `DD-<clause>` + `file:line`.
>
> **Precedence (resolve in this order, never silently):** the **brief's own stated visual direction WINS outright** — including when it asks for one of the `DD-4` tells. Then the **project's design-system / SCSS / frontend-pattern docs and accepted ADRs** — a house style IS an intentional identity, and re-deciding it per feature is the incoherence this gate prevents. Then these clauses. A genuine conflict is SURFACED to the user with both sides, NEVER resolved silently.
>
> **Relationship to `UI-1.1`–`UI-9.4`:** a different question, no overlap — the 40 clauses ask _"is this usable, accessible, consistent?"_ (a measurable floor); this gate asks _"is this THIS product's interface, or the one any generator would emit for any brief?"_. A surface can pass all 40 clauses and still be a template. BOTH bind; where they touch (type scale, colour, motion timing) the clause sets the floor and this gate picks the value.
>
> - `DD-1` **Ground it in the subject matter.** Before designing, name the concrete subject, the audience, and the design's primary job — and CONFIRM with the user when the brief is silent. Distinctive choices come FROM the subject's industry, materials and vernacular; they are never taste applied on top. **Test: if the palette, type and layout would fit a different product unchanged, there is no identity yet.**
> - `DD-2` **Every choice carries a WHY.** "It's common", "it's clean", "users expect it" are not reasons. A decision with no articulable reason is a default that arrived unnoticed. Defaults hide in what feels like infrastructure — typography, navigation, data display, and TOKEN NAMES. **Token-name test: someone reading only your CSS variables should be able to guess what product this is** (`--ink`/`--parchment` evoke a world; `--gray-700`/`--surface-2` evoke a template).
> - `DD-3` **Two passes, and the review pass is mandatory.** (1a) Write a compact **design plan** — Colour (4–6 named hex values) · Type (families + roles + scale) · Layout (one-sentence prose + ASCII wireframes to compare alternatives, including alignment: left/centre/justified) · Principles (what makes THIS page unique). (1b) **BLOCKING generic test — before any code:** work through a similar prompt and see whether you arrive somewhere similar; **any part that reads like the generic default for any comparable page rather than a choice for THIS brief gets REVISED, and you state what you changed and why.** Then (2a) build the REVISED plan, (2b) critique. — why: writing a plan and going straight to code reproduces the default, because the plan came from the same patterns the code will.
> - `DD-4` **Audit every FREE axis against the generated-design tell catalog** (`[model-knowledge]`, calibration not prohibition — each trait is legitimate for SOME brief): **T1** cream `#F4F1EA` + high-contrast serif + terracotta near `#D97757` (Anthropic's own interaction accent — on a user's brief it reads specifically as a tell) · **T2** near-black + one acid-green/vermilion accent · **T3** broadsheet hairline-rule pastiche, zero radius, dense columns · **T4** the SaaS-card kit: identical rounded cards, ONE radius regardless of hierarchy, the same `rgba(0,0,0,.1)` shadow under each, gradient washes as decoration · **T5** template chrome whatever the subject: tracked-out ALL-CAPS eyebrow above every heading, meta strings joined with middle dots (`A · B · C`), `WORD — fragment` labels with a spaced em dash, tinted near-black (`#0B0B0B`/`#111`) standing in for black, monospace for small data labels, `→` appended to link/button text. **A match is a HYPOTHESIS about a missed decision, never a defect** — promote it only by naming the axis, that the brief left it free, and what the subject suggested instead.
> - `DD-5` **Typography carries the personality.** One family, or two CLEARLY distinct ones — you do NOT need separate display and body faces. Choose deliberately, not the default you would reach for on any project. Set a real scale with intentional weights, widths and spacing. When type is a headline it is an ACTIVE part of the design, not a neutral delivery vehicle. Measure under ~80 characters; serifs tolerate slightly longer lines and want slightly more line-height than sans at the same size. Hierarchy needs weight/tracking/opacity, not size alone. **Avoid the three commonest tells: accenting a single word in a headline (italic/bold/colour) · ALL CAPS labels · an eyebrow label that names the section the heading already names.**
> - `DD-6` **Structure is information, not decoration.** Outlines, borders, numbering, eyebrows, dividers and labels must encode something about the content. **Before adding numbered markers (`01 / 02 / 03`), check the content really IS a sequence** — a stepped process, timeline or ranking. For every device ask: what does this tell the reader that whitespace would not? Nothing → cut it. **Hero:** open with the most characteristic thing in the subject's world, in whatever form fits (headline, image, animation, live demo, interactive moment) — big-number-plus-small-label-plus-gradient is the DEFAULT treatment, so use it only when it is genuinely best here. **Composition:** rhythm over monotone (same card size, same gap, same density everywhere is the sound of no one deciding); proportions must say something you can articulate; one dominant focal point.
> - `DD-7` **Motion sparingly and deliberately.** Non-user-triggered motion draws attention ONLY. One orchestrated moment — a single page-load sequence or one reveal — lands better than scattered effects; **fade-and-slide-up entrances on each section and hover transitions on every card are the generic default and read as generated.** Motion that ANSWERS a person's action (opening, expanding, confirming) is welcome when it shows what changed. Honour `prefers-reduced-motion`.
> - `DD-8` **Spend boldness once, then remove one accessory.** Let ONE element be the memorable thing and keep everything around it quiet and disciplined; cut any decoration that does not serve the brief. **Critique the BUILT page, not just the plan** — composition, craft (density is a decision, not a constant), content coherence, and CSS honesty (negative margins undoing a parent's padding, `calc()` values that exist only as workarounds, absolute positioning to escape layout flow are lies; the correct answer is always simpler than the hack). Take screenshots to review where the environment supports it — a picture is worth 1000 tokens. Then ask "if they said this lacks craft, what would they point to?" and fix that. **Build the quality floor in silently** — responsive, visible keyboard focus, reduced-motion respected, measured contrast, tokens never raw hex or magic numbers — and watch CSS selector specificity, where a type-based selector (`.section`) and an element-based one (`.cta`) most often cancel each other's padding/margin.
>
> **Memory:** vary between briefs — light and dark, families, direction. NEVER converge on the same choice across generations (Space Grotesk, for example). Where the project already has a design system, tokens, or an `interface-system.md`, ADOPT and record it rather than re-deciding; write back any pattern used 2+ times with measurements worth remembering.
>
> **Skip ONLY** when the change has NO user-facing visual surface (backend-only, tooling, docs) — state that reason explicitly so the skip is auditable, not an omission.

<!-- SYNC:ui-copywriting -->

> **Words are design content, not decoration** — binds whenever a task authors, changes, or reviews user-visible strings (labels, CTAs, headings, empty/error/loading text, toasts, placeholder content). Deep detail: `.claude/docs/design-knowledge.md` §8. Copy makes a design feel as templated as the visuals do.
>
> Before writing anything, ask what the design needs to SAY and how it can best be said to help the person navigate the experience. Then:
>
> 1. **Write from the end user's perspective.** Name things by what users will understand in simple language, not by how the system is built — a user manages **notifications**, not **webhook config**. Describe what something is or does in plain terms rather than selling it. Being specific and legible to a new user ALWAYS beats being clever.
> 2. **Active voice by default.** A CTA says exactly what happens when it is used: **"Save changes"**, NEVER "Submit".
> 3. **One name per action, across the whole flow.** The button that says **Publish** produces a toast that says **Published**. The vocabulary of an interface is the signposting for someone navigating the product — cohesion and consistency are how people learn their way around.
> 4. **Failure and emptiness give DIRECTION, not mood.** Explain what went wrong and how to fix it, in the interface's voice rather than a person's. **Errors do NOT apologize, and are NEVER vague about what happened.** An empty screen is an invitation to act.
> 5. **Conversational tone, one job per element.** Plain verbs, sentence case, no filler, tone matched to the brand and the audience; let each written element do exactly one job.
> 6. **Real content, never lorem.** When the brief supplies no copy, write plausible strings for the ACTUAL subject. **Coherence check — read every visible string as a user would, checking for truth, not typos:** could a real person at a real company be looking at exactly this data right now, or does the page title belong to one product, the body to another, and the sidebar metrics to a third? A beautifully designed interface with nonsensical content is a movie set with no script.

Full catalog (`A1`…`Q`, ~130 checks with failure signals and default severities): **`.claude/docs/design-review-checklist.md`**. This gate carries the protocol and the triage pass; the file carries the checks.
>
> **Applies when — and ONLY when — the change, plan, or artifact carries a user-facing front-end surface.** A back-end-only diff, a doc edit, or a config change is `N/A`: state that once and move on. NEVER run a UI review on a non-UI change to manufacture coverage. When it DOES apply, **MUST ATTENTION READ `.claude/docs/design-review-checklist.md` and work its sections** — a review that cites a check ID without opening the catalog is asserting, not checking.
>
> **`CL-1` Context before checks (§0.1).** Establish platform · primary user & expertise · primary task · success metric · constraints · review scope · available artifacts. Fewer than four known → state the gap at the top of the report and mark affected findings **low confidence** — why: a check judged against an unknown task is a guess wearing an ID.
>
> **`CL-2` Evidence or nothing (§0.2).** Every finding cites a specific location (screen · element · `file:line`). NEVER invent a measurement — contrast, tap-target size, and load time that cannot be measured from the given artifact are `NOT VERIFIABLE`, never a guessed number. Tag every finding `MEASURED` · `OBSERVED` · `HEURISTIC`. Status values: `PASS` · `FAIL` · `PARTIAL` · `N/A` · `NOT VERIFIABLE`.
>
> **`CL-3` Severity, then a cap (§0.3).** `P0` blocks task completion / loses data / excludes a protected group (ship blocker) · `P1` significant friction or a legal accessibility floor (fix before release) · `P2` measurable inefficiency (next iteration) · `P3` polish (backlog) · `P4` note. Cap the report at the top 10 by severity unless a full audit was requested. A clean section reports "no issues found" — NEVER pad. Every `P0`/`P1` carries a concrete fix.
>
> **`CL-4` Section sweep, in order.** §A core usability heuristics · §B cognitive load & decision design · §C visual design & hierarchy · §D interaction + **the eight screen states** (ideal, empty, first-run, loading, partial, error, offline, maximum-data) · §E information architecture · **§F web / §G mobile / §H desktop — conditional on platform** · §I accessibility (WCAG 2.2 AA; every item `P1` minimum, `P0` when it blocks the task) · §J content & UX writing · §K trust, ethics & privacy (dark patterns are `P0`) · **§L AI & agentic patterns — conditional on the product having AI features** · §M cross-cutting consistency · §N edge-case probes. One focused pass per section — why: a section skipped in the long middle silently becomes an unreported defect class.
>
> **`CL-5` Quick Triage Pass (§P)** when a full sweep is not possible — these 10 catch the majority of serious defects: (1) can a new user complete the primary task unaided · (2) does every action give visible feedback within 400ms · (3) do empty/loading/error states exist AND offer a forward path · (4) is the primary action obvious, singular, reachable · (5) text ≥4.5:1 contrast and focus visible · (6) whole flow completable by keyboard · (7) touch targets ≥44/48px · (8) destructive actions reversible · (9) holds at 320px and 200% zoom · (10) any dark patterns.
>
> **`CL-6` Report shape (§O).** Context (+ known gaps) → Verdict (Ship / Ship with fixes / Do not ship) → What works (2–4 specific strengths, cited) → Findings grouped `P0`→`P3`, each with Location · Evidence + tag · Impact · Principle (checklist ID) · Fix → Open questions → Coverage table. Any `P0` caps the grade at Fail regardless of score; report a score only ALONGSIDE findings, never instead of them.
>
> **Precedence and no-double-counting.** The project's design-system / SCSS / frontend-pattern docs and accepted ADRs OUTRANK this checklist; the brief's stated direction outranks aesthetic judgment. A deliberate, documented convention is NEVER a defect — check intent before flagging, and surface a genuine conflict to the user with both sides, NEVER resolve it silently. This checklist is the review PROCEDURE, not a third set of taste rules: `UI-1.1`–`UI-9.4` ask "does it meet the usability floor?", `DD-1`–`DD-8` ask "is this THIS product's interface?", and these checks ask "did the review actually look, with evidence, and rank it?". Where a check restates a `UI-*` or `DD-*` clause, report the defect ONCE under whichever ID the consuming skill already uses.
>
> **For a PLAN or a PLAN REVIEW.** When the plan contains front-end work, the checklist binds the plan's ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA, not a built page: name the platform, the applicable conditional sections (§F/§G/§H, §L), the eight screen states each UI phase must deliver (§D2), and the §I accessibility floor — so the work is specified against the checklist before it is written. A UI phase whose acceptance criteria omit the states and the a11y floor is INCOMPLETE — say so.

<!-- SYNC:severity-rubric -->

> **Severity Rubric** — Classify every finding by consequence, not by effort, reviewer preference, or how annoying the fix is. One scale applies to every review, skill, agent, workflow, and host so a tier has the same meaning everywhere. Choose the highest credible consequence supported by evidence; do not lower a tier to make a round pass.
>
> **Finding vs observation (required):** An observation becomes a finding only when it names the affected user/system/data/contract, the shipped consequence, the evidence location, and the normalized tier. `INFO`, advice, preference, duplicate wording, or an unsubstantiated concern is not a finding and must not reopen a loop. If the concern might affect a required behavior or gate but evidence is incomplete, emit `NOT VERIFIABLE` with the missing evidence and keep it unresolved; never silently convert uncertainty into LOW.
>
> | Severity | Action | Definition and examples |
> | --- | --- | --- |
> | CRITICAL | Block immediately; escalate | Immediate material risk if shipped: authentication/authorization or safety bypass; secrets/PII exposure; irreversible destructive action; data loss/corruption; or a silent failure on a critical path. A failed binary gate that makes the result untrustworthy is represented as a separate synthetic blocker by the executable policy (not as an ordinary severity judgment). |
> | HIGH | Must fix before PASS/merge | Material correctness or contract risk: wrong behavior on a supported path; violated business/data invariant; meaningful privacy or authority gap; breaking API/schema/compatibility change; likely harm to users/downstream systems; or a missing proof for a behavior-changing fix. |
> | MEDIUM | Must clear the current round; escalate if the fix needs an owner decision | Bounded but consequential risk: an edge case, resilience/observability/testability/maintainability gap, credible future defect, or local architectural drift whose impact is real but not immediate material loss. An explicit follow-up records the escalation/residual risk; it does not make an open MEDIUM a clean pass. |
> | LOW | Record and defer; never open another fix/re-review round from round 2 onward | Non-blocking polish with no credible present correctness, security, privacy, authority, availability, or data-integrity impact: wording/formatting, minor documentation or convention drift, optional defensive cleanup, or a cosmetic/refinement suggestion. |
>
> **Consequence decision tree (apply in order):** (1) Is a binary gate failed? Keep it as a separate hard blocker (the executable helper represents it as synthetic CRITICAL); do not use the ordinary severity label to hide what failed. Otherwise, would shipping permit immediate material security/safety/authority harm, irreversible destruction, data loss/corruption, or a critical-path silent failure? → **CRITICAL**. (2) Otherwise, does a supported path, invariant, public contract, privacy/authority boundary, compatibility promise, or behavior-changing proof fail with material user/downstream impact? → **HIGH**. (3) Otherwise, is there a bounded but consequential edge, resilience, observability, testability, maintainability, or architectural gap with a credible impact? → **MEDIUM**. (4) Otherwise, is the evidence sufficient to show only non-blocking polish with no credible present material impact? → **LOW**. (5) If the evidence needed to choose between steps 1–4 is missing, → **NOT VERIFIABLE**, not LOW. When multiple tiers fit, select the highest credible consequence; effort, implementation cost, reviewer discomfort, frequency alone, and proximity to the round cap never decide the tier.

> **Boundary examples (normalize before applying the round predicate):** an auth bypass, exposed secret/PII, destructive command without an authority gate, or failed required test/generation/parity gate is **CRITICAL**; a wrong supported response, broken invariant/API/schema, meaningful privacy/authority defect, or unproven behavior-changing fix is **HIGH**; a bounded retry/timeout/alert/testability gap or credible maintainability drift is **MEDIUM**; a typo, formatting inconsistency, optional cleanup, or cosmetic suggestion proven not to affect present behavior is **LOW**. A missing fact about any of those boundaries is **NOT VERIFIABLE** until evidence or an explicitly documented residual-risk decision exists.
>
> **Classification procedure (required for every finding):** (1) state the affected user, system, data, contract, or gate; (2) assess consequence if the issue ships; (3) assess exposure/likelihood and reversibility/detectability; (4) select the highest tier justified by those facts; (5) cite `file:line` or equivalent evidence and a confidence percentage. Effort, implementation cost, reviewer discomfort, and proximity to the round cap are never severity inputs. `NOT VERIFIABLE` is a pending evidence state, not one of the four tiers and never a LOW escape hatch: if the unresolved claim could affect required behavior, security, privacy, authority, availability, data integrity, or a binary gate, it remains an open evidence blocker until resolved or explicitly owner-accepted with documented residual risk. Classify an item LOW only when evidence supports the absence of credible present material impact.
>
> **Hard-gate rule:** Binary gates (tests, required artifacts, security must-fix checks, generated parity, policy compliance) are not ordinary severity-rated findings. The executable helper records a failed gate as a synthetic CRITICAL blocker solely so one predicate can carry it; the report must still name the gate and failure evidence. A failed gate blocks at every round, including when all ordinary findings are LOW; never disguise a failed gate as LOW.
>
> **Score-based skills** map their numeric scale onto these tiers — do not invent a parallel vocabulary:
>
> - **0-2 criterion scoring** (e.g. production-readiness-review): `0` = CRITICAL/HIGH (criterion unmet, blocks readiness), `1` = MEDIUM (partial, consequential gap), `2` = pass (no finding). If the criterion is only polish, use LOW rather than forcing a `0`.
> - **Two-axis scoring** (e.g. performance-review, impact × likelihood): high impact + high exposure → CRITICAL/HIGH; material impact with bounded exposure → HIGH/MEDIUM; low impact and low exposure → LOW. Record the axes and why the selected tier is the highest credible consequence.
> - **Scorecards / `/20` grades** (e.g. architecture-scalability-review): the aggregate score and verdict band are separate from finding severity. A sub-80 area is evidence to investigate, not an automatic CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW label; classify each underlying gap by the consequence decision tree and keep advisory score deductions separate from blocking findings.
>
> **Domain-vocabulary normalization (mandatory):** Specialized skills may keep a local reporting vocabulary, but it MUST feed this same four-tier round predicate — never a second severity system:
>
> - `BLOCKED`, `HARD FAIL`, or `FAIL` is a blocking local verdict, not an automatic CRITICAL label. Classify the underlying consequence as CRITICAL when it is an immediate material risk or failed binary gate; otherwise classify it as HIGH or MEDIUM with evidence, while preserving the local block until the owning gate is satisfied.
> - `WARN` is not permission to ignore a finding. Map it to MEDIUM when the gap is consequential, to LOW only when evidence supports no credible present material impact, or upward to HIGH/CRITICAL when the consequence warrants it. `PASS`/compliant is not a finding.
> - UI `P0`/`P1`/`P2`/`P3`/`P4` map to CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW/LOW respectively as a starting point; override upward only when the evidence shows a higher shipped consequence. A P0/P1 accessibility or task-completion floor remains a blocking gate even when a local UI report calls it a priority rather than a severity.
> - Numeric SRE/readiness or impact/likelihood scores are evidence inputs, not replacement tiers. Emit the score, the consequence, and the normalized CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW tier together. `INFO`/advisory observations are not findings unless the evidence shows a material consequence.
>
> A finding's tier drives the gate: CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM remain actionable and blocking under the round policy; LOW may be tracked as a follow-up and, from round 2, does not by itself justify another fix/re-review. An owner decision may explain or schedule an open MEDIUM but does not turn it into a clean pass; owner acceptance never makes a failed binary gate pass and must record scope, rationale, and residual risk.

> **Parallel Sub-Agent Dispatch** — Plan parallelism the moment a task breakdown exists, BEFORE executing it — running provably independent tasks sequentially wastes wall-clock. Applies to every multi-step job: workflow steps, planning, batch updates, investigation, research, scans, reviews, doc sync. **Plan execution is metadata-gated, NEVER default-parallel** — fan-out follows ONLY what the plan declares (`PAR`/`SEQ` tags + per-phase write set); an untagged plan runs sequentially — why: a derived write set cannot see cascade or generated writes.
>
> 1. **Tag every task `PAR` or `SEQ`.** `PAR` = inputs exclude every pending task's output AND write set disjoint from every other `PAR`. Else `SEQ` — MUST ATTENTION name the dependency forcing it.
> 2. **Group `PAR` into waves.** No edge between members. Two writers of one file NEVER share a wave. Read-only work (search, investigation, review, research) parallelizes freely.
> 3. **Declare before dispatch:** `Parallel plan: wave 1 = [...] · wave 2 = [...] · SEQ = [...] (reason)`.
> 4. **Spawn each wave in ONE message** — every `spawn_agent` call in one response, NEVER dripped per turn. Route each task to its specialist (`.claude/skills/shared/sub-agent-selection-guide.md`); NEVER `code-reviewer` as catch-all.
> 5. **Brief each sub-agent self-contained:** goal · scope + owned files · reference docs · return contract (summary + `Full report:` path, per SYNC:subagent-return-contract) · incremental persistence to `tmp/reports/` (per SYNC:incremental-persistence).
> 6. **Barrier per wave.** Advance ONLY after EVERY member returns (a skipped conditional counts as returned). Merge, mark each task completed/skipped, THEN dispatch the next wave. Mutating steps wait for the barrier.
> 7. **One level deep.** A dispatched sub-agent executes its own brief; further fan-out stays the orchestrator's job unless that agent's `.claude/agents/*.md` definition authorizes it.

Full contract: `.claude/skills/project-skill-protocol/references/registry.md`.
>
> Overlays are **ADDITIVE ONLY**: they ADD rules on top of this skill's own protocol and NEVER replace, override, disable, or reinterpret a rule it already states — removing every overlay must return this skill to exactly its documented behavior.

<!-- SYNC:design-review-checklist:reminder -->

- **MUST ATTENTION** when the change/plan/artifact has a user-facing front-end surface, READ `.claude/docs/design-review-checklist.md` and run it: `CL-1` establish context first (platform · user · task · metric · constraints · scope · artifacts — fewer than four → state the gap, findings are low confidence) · `CL-2` evidence or nothing, cite a location per finding, NEVER invent a measurement (unmeasurable → `NOT VERIFIABLE`), tag `MEASURED`/`OBSERVED`/`HEURISTIC` · `CL-3` rank `P0`–`P4`, cap at top 10 by severity, NEVER pad, concrete fix on every `P0`/`P1` · `CL-4` sweep §A–§N in order, one focused pass each, with §F/§G/§H and §L applied only when the platform/product matches and §I (WCAG 2.2 AA) as a `P1` floor · `CL-5` short on time → run the 10-check §P triage · `CL-6` report in the §O shape. Project design-system docs and ADRs OUTRANK the checklist; report a defect ONCE across `UI-*`/`DD-*`/`CL-*`. For a plan, the checklist binds the UI phases' acceptance criteria (platform, conditional sections, the eight screen states, the a11y floor).

## Closing Reminders

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION Goal:** Complete the selected plan phase as working, fully-tested, reviewed, user-approved code through its testing, code review, and approval gates. Git operations are optional and require an explicit user request — NEVER bypass a quality or authority gate to declare done.

**Protocols in force (concise digest of the SYNC/shared blocks this skill carries):**

- **End-To-Start Debugger Trace:** Trace observed end state backward through all feeders before fixing.
- **Plan Granularity:** Verify every phase passes the 5-point check; sub-plan failures.
- **Nested Task Creation:** Expand child phases and link the parent when nested.
- **Project Reference Docs Guide:** Read required project-reference docs (always `lessons.md`); cite them first.
- **Critical Thinking:** Apply critical + sequential thinking; traced proof, confidence >80% to act.
- **Understand Code First:** Search 3+ patterns and read code before any modification.
- **Source/Test Drift Check:** When behavior changes, reconcile affected tests from evidence.
- **AI Mistake Prevention:** verify generated content against evidence, trace downstream references, verify all affected outputs, re-read after context loss, surface ambiguity.
- **Parallel Sub-Agent Dispatch:** Tag tasks PAR/SEQ, group PAR into disjoint-write-set waves, spawn each wave in ONE message, barrier before advancing.

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** run the full step spine in declared order, emit `✓ Step N:` each: Step 0 detect plan + select next incomplete phase → Step 1 Analysis & Task Extraction (read plan, Goal-Contract read, Trace Gate, seed task tracking) → Step 2 Implementation (code + type-check/compile; UI → `ui-ux-designer`) → Step 3 Testing (`tester`→`debugger` until 100%) → Step 4 Code Review (`code-reviewer` until the current severity bar is clear: round 1 zero findings, round 2+ zero CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM with LOW deferred) → Step 5 User Approval (BLOCKING, wait) → Step 6 Finalize (`project-manager` + `docs-manager`; optional `git-manager` only for an explicit user request).
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** execute Steps 0-6 in declared order; the three BLOCKING gates — tests 100% (Step 3), no blocking findings under the current severity bar (Step 4), explicit user approval (Step 5) — cannot be faked-green: NEVER skip a step, proceed on failed validation, or assume approval — why: a faked-green gate ships the regression the test exists to catch.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** cite `file:line` evidence for every claim, finding, and recommendation with confidence % — >80% to act, <80% verify first, <60% do NOT recommend — why: speculation passed as fact is the root of every hallucinated fix.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** break work into small task tracking todos BEFORE the first read/edit, keep exactly one `in_progress`, mark `completed` immediately after each step's evidence, add a final review todo — on context loss call the current task list first, never duplicate — why: long files exhaust context and silently lose findings.

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** Pre-Implementation Granularity Gate + Trace Gate STOP the run BEFORE coding — refuse phases with planning verbs / unnamed files / unresolved decisions (sub-plan instead), and require the End→Start `Debugger Trace` (final state → reader → storage → writer → producer → trigger, all feeder paths, hypothesis matrix, owning fix layer, forward convergence) for any bug/regression/behavior-changing plan — why: implementing a vague phase or fixing the symptom site wastes the run.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** search 3+ existing patterns and READ target code (cite `file:line`) before writing — match local conventions over generic framework defaults, run a graph trace when `.code-graph/graph.db` exists; never invent a pattern when one exists — why: projects carry local conventions that framework defaults violate.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** fix at the LOWEST owning layer (Entity/Model > Service > Component/Handler), never patch the symptom/crash site — trace "whose responsibility?" first — why: one fix at the invariant owner protects all downstream consumers.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** a behavior change is NOT done until the Spec-Loop closes — universally-quantified property TC + boundary counter-case for every [HARD] rule touched, a mutation-killed test on each changed core-logic line, and a Dual-Feedback Ledger entry into BOTH spec AND tests — re-verify the whole package (spec + tests + code), not just the diff.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** keep existing tests real and genuinely passing — NEVER comment out tests, weaken assertions, change assertions to pass, or use fake data; apply the source/test drift check when behavior changes — why: faked green hides the regression the test exists to catch.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** mode flags add/remove ONE step, never relax a running gate — `--approval=off` skips Step 5, `--tests=off` skips Step 3, `--parallel={auto|on|off}` controls Step 2 fan-out (`off` = default sequential, `on` = explicit opt-in, `auto` = fan out only on plan-declared `PAR`/`SEQ` metadata); debugger-trace + granularity + quality bars + all SYNC blocks apply in EVERY mode.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** Step 2 is SEQUENTIAL by default — fan out only on the explicit `--parallel`/`--parallel=on` opt-in, or under `--parallel=auto` when EVERY in-scope phase carries a plan-declared `## Parallel Execution` block; `auto` with no such block falls back to sequential and NEVER derives write sets optimistically — why: a derived write set cannot see cascade/generated writes, so two "disjoint" phases silently collide on the same generated artifact.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** when a wave does run — NEVER co-schedule two writers of the same file, declare the wave plan, spawn every member in ONE message, then hold the barrier until EVERY member is accounted for by name; a failed, timed-out, or partial member blocks the barrier, is never assumed successful, and its phase is re-implemented sequentially before the next wave — why: an advanced barrier on an incomplete wave ships half a phase as if it were whole.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** gates are SEQ boundaries — Step 3 Testing, Step 4 Code Review, and the Step 5 approval gate run after the barrier on the merged result; a subagent's self-report NEVER substitutes for a host gate — why: parallelism may shorten the run, never the gate.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** standalone (no parent `[Workflow]` row via the current task list) → wrap Steps 0-6 in plan → plan-review → proceed → `$changes-review` → `$why-review`, with `$changes-review` + `$why-review` as the LAST todos; validate decisions with the user by asking the user directly — never auto-decide — why: standalone runs have no workflow enforcing review before commit.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** READ `CLAUDE.md` and the path-matched project-reference docs (frontend/scss/design-system for UI, domain-entities for models) before starting.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** Easy to Change is the success metric — every finding, test, refactor, abstraction must make the NEXT change cheaper; name the real enemies (coupling, hidden state, duplicated knowledge, unclear intent) and reject anything that raises change cost.

| "Code review found only minor issues"            | Apply the current round bar: Round 1 fixes every validated severity; Round 2+ defers LOW-only findings but still blocks on CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM and failed binary gates. |
| "Obviously approved / they'll approve"           | Step 5 is BLOCKING — stop and wait for an explicit user response, never assume approval.           |
| "Phase is clear enough to start"                 | Run the Granularity Gate — planning verbs / unnamed files / open decisions → sub-plan, don't code. |
| "It's a quick fix, skip the trace"               | Bug/regression plan needs the End→Start trace + hypothesis matrix BEFORE the fix.                  |
| "Code change is enough, spec/tests later"        | Behavior change → property TC + mutation-killed test + Dual-Feedback into spec AND tests, or INCOMPLETE. |
| "Standalone, so skip review"                     | No workflow = YOU add `$changes-review` + `$why-review` as the last todos.                         |
| "The plan looks parallelizable — fan it out"     | Fan-out is OPT-IN: `--parallel`/`--parallel=on`, or `--parallel=auto` **plus** a plan-declared `## Parallel Execution` block. No opt-in, no metadata → sequential. |
| "I can infer the write sets from the plan"       | Not under `auto` — a derived set misses cascade/generated writes and collides on files no phase names. Fall back to sequential. |
| "Both phases only touch different functions"     | The unit of ownership is the FILE — any shared path splits the phases into different waves.        |
| "One wave member never came back, the rest passed" | The barrier does NOT advance — account for every member by name; failed/timed-out/partial → re-run that phase sequentially. |

---

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** the three BLOCKING gates (tests 100% · no blocking findings under the current review bar · explicit approval) cannot be faked-green — Round 1 blocks every validated severity, Round 2+ defers LOW-only findings but still blocks CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM and failed binary gates; NEVER bypass a gate to declare done.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** implementation completion, review approval and `--approval=off` never authorize Git: require explicit user operation/scope/sourceRequest, report completion independently, and NEVER `git commit --amend`.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** cite `file:line` + confidence % for every claim; search 3+ patterns and read code before writing.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** break work into small task tracking todos BEFORE starting; add a final review todo; on context loss call the current task list first.

## [WORKFLOW-EXECUTION-PROTOCOL] [BLOCKING] Workflow Execution Protocol — MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST CRITICAL. Do not skip for any reason.

**Generic portability boundary:** Reusable skills and protocol text stay project-neutral; project-specific conventions are discovered from docs/project-config.json and docs/project-reference/. Apply shared AI-SDD from `shared/sdd-artifact-contract.md`. Read `docs/project-config.json` and `docs/project-reference/docs-index-reference.md`, then open the project reference docs named there immediately before the first target read, grep, edit, test, or analysis. For spec, test-case, behavior-change, public-contract, or `docs/specs/` work, route through the local spec docs named by the docs index: `feature-spec-reference.md`, `spec-system-reference.md`, `spec-principles.md`, and `workflow-spec-test-code-cycle-reference.md` when specs/tests/code must stay synchronized. If either file or a required reference doc is missing or stale, auto-run `$project-init` (or the narrow lower-level route such as `$project-config`, `$docs-init`, `$scan-all`, or `$scan --target=<key>`) before ordinary project-specific work. After compaction, resume, delegation, or a material context change, re-read the required docs and state `Reference docs read: ... | Not applicable: ...`; a hook reminder or prior conversation is not proof that the files are loaded. Any supported AI tool may execute when this shared context and local docs are available.

1. **DETECT:** If the prompt starts with an explicit slash skill/workflow command, execute it directly. Otherwise match the prompt against the workflow catalog and skill list.
2. **ANALYZE:** Choose the best option: execute directly, invoke a skill, activate a standard workflow, or compose a custom step combination.
3. **AUTO-SELECT:** Pick the best option yourself. Do not ask the user to choose between direct execution, skill, standard workflow, or custom workflow.
4. **ACTIVATE:** For a selected workflow, call `$start-workflow <workflowId>`; for a selected skill, invoke that skill; for a custom workflow, sequence custom steps directly; for direct execution, proceed with the task.
5. **CREATE TASKS:** task tracking for ALL workflow/skill/custom steps before execution when the selected path has multiple steps.
6. **PARALLELIZE:** Before executing the task list, tag each task `PAR` (independent inputs + write set disjoint from every other `PAR` task) or `SEQ` (name the blocking dependency), group `PAR` tasks into waves, declare the wave plan, and spawn each wave's sub-agents in ONE message — all-return barrier per wave, fan-out one level deep unless a sub-agent's own definition authorizes further fan-out. Sequential-by-default is a defect when tasks are independent; do not parallelize shared write targets, output-consuming tasks, trivial single-file work, ordering a skill or workflow explicitly fixes, or user-approval gates.
7. **EXECUTE:** Advance per the **Workflow Step Advancement & Parallel Phases** rule in your context instructions — model-driven; a sub-agent completion advances a step identically to an inline call; a parallel-phase group is an all-return barrier (advance only after ALL members return, never serialize it)

> **AI-SDD Artifact Contract** — Shared spec-driven development rules stay portable and source-owned.
>
> 1. Keep reusable AI-SDD principles in `.claude`; put repository-specific paths, commands, owners, products, and formats in project config/reference docs.
> 2. Preserve cycle: `spec -> plan -> tasks -> implement -> verify -> update spec/docs`.
> 3. Trace every requirement or invariant through decision, task, TC/test, source evidence, and docs/spec update.
> 4. Treat code-to-spec extraction as reference-only until accepted by the canonical spec owner.
> 5. Any supported AI tool may plan, implement, review, or verify with synced context; using multiple tools is optional.
> 6. Update `.claude` source first, then sync generated mirrors; do not manually edit `.agents`, `.codex`, or `AGENTS.md`. — why: mirrors are generated artifacts; hand-edits are overwritten on the next sync
> 7. If `docs/project-config.json`, root instruction files, or a required project-reference doc is missing or stale, auto-run `$project-init` or the narrow lower-level route before ordinary project-specific work.

## SYNC:ai-sdd-artifact-contract:reminder

- **MANDATORY** Apply `shared/sdd-artifact-contract.md`; keep reusable AI-SDD in `.claude` and local rules in project docs.
- **MANDATORY** Code-to-spec extraction is reference-only until canonical acceptance; any supported AI tool may execute with synced context.
- **MANDATORY** Update `.claude` source before syncing generated mirrors; do not manually edit `.agents`, `.codex`, or `AGENTS.md`.
- **MANDATORY** Missing or stale project config, root instruction files, or required reference docs route project-specific work through `$project-init` or the narrow setup route automatically.
**[TASK-PLANNING] [MANDATORY]** BEFORE executing any workflow or skill step, create/update task tracking for all planned steps, then keep it synchronized as each step starts/completes.
## [LESSON-LEARNED-REMINDER] [BLOCKING] Task Planning & Continuous Improvement — MANDATORY. Do not skip.

Break work into small tasks (task tracking) before starting. Add final task: "Analyze AI mistakes & lessons learned".

**Extract lessons — ROOT CAUSE ONLY, not symptom fixes:**
1. Name the FAILURE MODE (reasoning/assumption failure), not symptom — "assumed API existed without reading source" not "used wrong enum value".
2. Generality test: does this failure mode apply to ≥3 contexts/codebases? If not, abstract one level up.
3. Write as a universal rule — strip project-specific names/paths/classes. Useful on any codebase.
4. Consolidate: multiple mistakes sharing one failure mode → ONE lesson.
5. **Recurrence gate:** "Would this recur in future session WITHOUT this reminder?" — No → skip `$learn`.
6. **Auto-fix gate:** "Could `$code-review`/`$code-simplifier`/`$security-review`/`$lint` catch this?" — Yes → improve review skill instead.
7. BOTH gates pass → ask user to run `$learn`.
**[CRITICAL-THINKING-MINDSET]** Apply critical thinking, sequential thinking. Every claim needs traced proof, confidence >80% to act.
**Anti-hallucination principle:** Never present guess as fact — cite sources for every claim, admit uncertainty freely, self-check output for errors, cross-reference independently, stay skeptical of own confidence — certainty without evidence root of all hallucination.
**AI Attention principle (Primacy-Recency):** Put the 3 most critical rules at both top and bottom of long prompts/protocols so instruction adherence survives long context windows.
**Goal-driven execution:** Define success criteria first, loop until verified, and stop only when observable checks pass.
**Tests verify intent:** Tests must protect business rules/invariants and fail when the protected intent breaks, not only mirror current behavior.
## Common AI Mistake Prevention (System Lessons)

- **FIX GATE — INVESTIGATE FIRST.** Before applying any project-related fix, always invoke `$investigate` or `$debug-investigate` and establish the root cause; the failure site may be only a symptom.
- **FAILED-TEST GATE.** For any failed or flaky test, `$debug-investigate` is mandatory before editing source or tests; never change either side merely to force green.
- **Re-read files after context compaction.** Edit requires prior Read in same context; compaction wipes read state. Re-read before editing.
- **Grep for old terms after bulk replacements.** AI over-trusts find/replace completeness. Grep full repo after bulk edits for missed refs in docs/configs/catalogs.
- **Check downstream references before deleting.** Deletions cascade doc/code staleness. Map referencing files before removal.
- **After memory loss, check existing state before creating new.** Compaction wipes prior-work memory. Query current state to resume — never blindly duplicate.
- **Verify AI-generated content against actual code.** AI hallucinates APIs, class names, method signatures. Grep to confirm existence before documenting/referencing.
- **Trace full dependency chain after edits.** Changing a definition misses downstream consumers. Trace the full chain.
- **When renaming, grep ALL consumer file types.** Some file types silently ignore missing refs (no compile error). Search code, templates, configs, generated files.
- **Trace ALL code paths when verifying correctness.** Code existing ≠ code executing. Trace early exits, error branches, conditional skips — not just happy path.
- **Update docs that embed canonical data when source changes.** Docs inlining derived data (workflows, schemas, configs) go stale silently. Update all embedding docs alongside source.
- **Verify sub-agent results after context recovery.** Background agents may finish while parent compacted — grep-verify output, don't trust assumed completion.
- **Cross-check full target list against sub-agent assignments.** Parallel sub-agents by category miss boundary items. Reconcile union of assignments against target list before proceeding.
- **Sub-agents inherit knowledge only from their agent .md definition — use custom agent types, not built-in Explore.** Tool adoption = permission + knowledge + enforcement (numbered workflow step).
- **Persist sub-agent findings incrementally, not as a final batch.** Long sub-agents hit cutoffs before final write — findings lost. Instruct append-per-section to report file.
- **When debugging, ask "whose responsibility?" before fixing.** Trace caller (wrong data) vs callee (wrong handling). Fix at responsible layer — never patch symptom site.
- **Test failure → record a provisional verdict before trace/edit, then investigate.** Use the full five-way taxonomy: SOURCE-WRONG (production violates intent), TEST-WRONG (assertion/setup is stale), TEST-NOT-OPTIMAL (valid but fragile or low-signal test), ENVIRONMENT-BLOCKED (external state prevents a verdict), or AMBIGUOUS (intent/evidence cannot choose safely). Then trace root cause and triangulate against the governing spec (`docs/specs/**` if one exists) AND source. NEVER weaken an assertion, add a skip, relax a timeout, or change source merely to force green.
- **Grep ALL removed names after extraction/refactoring.** Primary file "done" ≠ secondary files clean. Grep entire scope for every removed symbol before declaring complete.
- **Assume existing values are intentional — ask WHY before changing OR flagging one as a defect.** Pattern-matching as "wrong" skips context. Before changing or reporting any constant/limit/flag/cutoff: read comments, git blame, the CALLER's ordering (the guarantee that makes the value correct usually lives in code running immediately BEFORE the cited line), and 2+ sibling call sites of the same convention. A doc stating WHAT without WHY is missing rationale, not proof of a missing guard — and in a validation pass, an accurate `file:line` citation proves the transcription, never the defect.
- **Verify ALL affected outputs, not just the first.** One build green ≠ all green. Multi-stack changes (backend/frontend/tests/docs) require verifying EVERY output.
- **Evaluate fit before copying a nearby pattern.** Closest example ≠ matching preconditions — verify the new context shares the same constraints, base classes, scope, lifetime.
- **Holistic-first debugging — resist nearest-attention trap.** Don't dive into first plausible cause. List EVERY precondition (config, env vars, paths, DB, endpoints, creds, versions, DI, data). Verify each against evidence (grep/query — not reasoning). Ask "what would falsify this?" — if nothing, it's not a hypothesis. Most expensive failure: going deeper in "obvious" layer while bug sits in layer never questioned.
- **Surgical changes — apply the diff test (context-aware).** Two modes: (1) Bug fix → every line traces to the bug; no restyling; orphan cleanup only for imports YOUR changes made unused. (2) Review/enhancement → implement improvements AND announce as "Enhancement beyond main request: [what]". Never silently scope-creep. Diff test: "Would this line exist if I wasn't asked to do X?" — if no, delete or announce.
- **Surface ambiguity before coding — don't pick silently.** Multiple valid interpretations → present each with effort: "[Request] could mean (1) [N h], (2) [N h]. Which matters?" List scope/format/volume/constraints assumptions first. If simpler path exists, say so. Never silently pick.
- **[MANDATORY FIRST ACTION] ALWAYS activate a suitable skill or workflow BEFORE responding.** Match task against workflow catalog + skill list; invoke via skill invocation or `$start-workflow <workflowId>`. NEVER answer or write code before checking. Skip = protocol violation.
- **Why-Review adversarial mindset — apply when reviewing any plan, decision, or design.** Default SKEPTIC not VALIDATOR: steel-man a rejected alternative, invert each stated reason ("what does it sacrifice?"), stress-test top 2-3 assumptions, run pre-mortem ("ships, fails in 3 months — what breaks?"), surface 1-2 alternatives author missed. Section presence ≠ quality; quality = causal reasoning + concrete mitigations + evidence, not "it's better" or "monitor closely".
- **Front-load report-write in sub-agent prompts for large reviews.** Many-file sub-agents hit budget before final write — findings lost. Design prompts so: (1) report-write is first explicit deliverable, (2) append per-file/section (not batched), (3) scope bounded so reads don't exhaust budget. Truncated mid-sentence with no report file → spawn narrower scope, don't retry same prompt.
- **After context compaction, re-verify all prior phase outcomes before continuing.** Summaries describe intent, not environment state (git index, filesystem, processes). On resume, FIRST audit: git status, re-read modified files, verify filesystem. Every "completed" claim is an untested hypothesis until evidence confirms.
- **OOM/memory: check row count before row size.** Triage: (1) Unbounded query — no DB filter for trigger? Push filter to DB; eliminates OOM. (2) Large rows? Projection reduces proportionally. Row reduction > projection in ROI.
- **Assert the outcome your system OWNS, never the intermediate state your INFRASTRUCTURE owns.** When testing anything asynchronous (queue/broker delivery, retries, background jobs, caches, replication), assert the final business/entity state. NEVER assert the delivery bookkeeping — consume/send status, attempt counts, last-error, row existence or counts in a broker, scheduler, or outbox/inbox table. That bookkeeping lives in shared infrastructure that ANY co-running process (a peer worker, a second replica, a leftover local container) can write, usually under a deterministic shared key, so the assertion silently tests the developer's environment instead of the system: green when run alone, flaky the instant anything else shares that broker + database. Gate question for every assertion: "would this hold no matter WHICH process did the work?" — if no, assert the converged data state instead. Corollary: process-local fault injection and in-process telemetry cannot gate work any process may perform — use them as stress amplifiers (arm → bounded window → disarm → assert convergence), never as preconditions.
- **Store disposable generated output in the project workspace.** If an output can be regenerated and is not source code, a canonical source-of-truth, or an intentionally versioned projection, write it under the project-root `tmp/` or `temp/` directory (prefer `tmp/`), scoped to the run. This includes temporary state, integration/E2E results, reports, logs, screenshots, traces, videos, coverage, dumps, and candidate evidence. Never put these outputs in source, docs, `plans/`, `team-artifacts/`, or mirror directories; the project-root `.gitignore` must ignore `/tmp/` and `/temp/` by default. Committed fixtures, accepted baselines, canonical specs/docs, and explicitly versioned generated mirrors remain at their declared owner paths.
- **Keep domain concepts out of generic/shared/infrastructure layers.** Reusable layer (shared library, framework, infra module) must reference NO consumer-specific domain concept — tenant/customer/product IDs, business entities, feature rules. Leak compiles + runs → passes review silently while coupling the "reusable" layer to one consumer. Keep shared type domain-free; push domain fields/logic down into the consumer via subclass/composition. — why: a layer coupled to one consumer's domain is no longer reusable.
