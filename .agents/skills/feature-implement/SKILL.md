> Codex compatibility note:
> - Invoke repository skills with `$skill-name` in Codex; this mirrored copy rewrites legacy Claude `/skill-name` references.
> - Host-native execution: Codex runs a skill by loading its `SKILL.md` instructions and executing the required steps with available tools. No separate `Skill` tool is required; a loaded skill is already activated.
> - Source vs execution: prefer the registered `.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` for Codex execution. `.claude/**` remains the canonical authoring source; reading it for a registry or source inspection does not switch this session to Claude Code.
> - Capability check: interpret Claude tool names through the active host before declaring a blocker. Continue when Codex can perform the required operation; stop and ask only when the actual capability is unavailable, naming the step and evidence. Host-native execution is not a protocol deviation and needs no extra approval.
> - Task tracker mandate: BEFORE executing any workflow or skill step, create/update task tracking for all steps and keep it synchronized as progress changes.
> - Use ask user tool to ask user.
> - Ignore Claude-specific mode-switch instructions when they appear.
> - Strict execution contract: when a user explicitly invokes a skill, execute that skill protocol as written.
> - Subagent authorization: when a skill is user-invoked or AI-detected and its protocol requires subagents, that skill activation authorizes use of the required `spawn_agent` subagent(s) for that task.
> - Do not skip, reorder, or merge protocol steps unless the user explicitly approves the deviation first.
> - For workflow skills, steps follow the guided contract in `$start-workflow` (gate steps fixed; other steps may flex with a logged reason); report step-by-step evidence.

## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Ship a correct, fully-verified feature that satisfies the saved Goal Contract — implemented with deep research, comprehensive planning, and maximum quality verification (planned, reviewed, tested, documented) — with no skipped quality gate on any non-trivial change.

**Summary:** Resolve the saved goal and spec contract, research and trace the feature, obtain an approved plan, implement every phase with its tests written together, review statically, verify once with a mutation check (`SYNC:verify-last-order`), reconcile specs and docs, and close with evidence; use fast mode only when every trivial-task condition is satisfied.

**Workflow:**

1. **Research** — Deep investigation, multiple researcher subagents
2. **Plan** — Detailed plan via `$plan`; user approval required
3. **Implement** — Execute with full code review + SRE review
4. **Review, then verify once** — static review fix-loop over the whole changeset, then run all tests once with a mutation check (fix and re-run to green; re-review only if that edited anything), update docs

**Key Rules:**

- Maximum thoroughness: research → plan → implement → review → test → docs
- User approval required at plan stage
- Break work into todo tasks; add final self-review task

> **Renamed:** formerly `cook` — now `$feature-implement`. The old name no longer resolves as a slash command.

> **feature-implement vs plan --mode=execute:** `feature-implement` takes an idea/feature description and goes idea → research → **plan (created here)** → shipped. Use `$plan --mode=execute` instead when a plan file already exists and you only need disciplined phase-by-phase execution + commit. feature-implement owns the front of the pipeline (research + planning); plan --mode=execute owns the back (phase gates + auto-commit + `--parallel`/`--approval`/`--tests` flags).

## Standalone Mode Pipeline (skip entirely only when `nested=true` — a `[Workflow]` row that merely exists in the current task list does not count)

> **MANDATORY — standalone `$feature-implement` only.** When invoked OUTSIDE a workflow, wrap the core spine in this quality loop. Detect nesting via the current task list FIRST: if THIS run is a step of a `[Workflow]` row (its own phase tasks are linked to that parent row, `nested=true` — a `[Workflow]` row that merely exists in the current task list, such as an abandoned one, does not count), SKIP this section — the surrounding workflow already sequences plan/review/why-review around this skill (e.g. `workflow-feature` wraps feature-implement with exactly these steps).
>
> Create these as task tracking tasks up front, in order, then execute them:
>
> 1. **`$spec` — spec-driven, BEFORE any plan or code.** Create or update the tech-free 8-section Feature Spec under the business spec root (default `docs/specs/`; `specRoots.business.path` in `docs/project-config.json` overrides) so the plan and implementation satisfy an agreed contract, not chat memory. Decide the case from evidence: net-new capability with no code yet → `$spec [mode=draft]` (provisional, `Evidence: TBD`); enhancement to an already-documented feature → `$spec [mode=update]`; behavior/contract change to existing spec → `$spec [mode=amend]`; buggy/undocumented area that now warrants a spec → `$spec [mode=init]`. If a governing spec already exists and fully covers this change, record `Spec verified current — no change` with `file:line` evidence and proceed. **Skip ONLY in fast mode** (ALL Default Mode Policy trivial-task conditions met — no behavior/contract change); record the skip reason. Decide the case explicitly — skip only the authoring, never the decision.
> 2. **`$plan`** — author the implementation plan from the spec. feature-implement's Comprehensive Planning phase (Step 2) satisfies this; emit a reviewable plan artifact under the plans root (default `plans/`; `docsRoots.plans.path` in `docs/project-config.json` overrides). Map each plan phase's `## Test Specifications` to the spec's §8 `TC-{FEATURE}-{NNN}` IDs.
> 3. **Proceed** — execute the core implementation spine up to the static code review (research already done → implement every phase with its tests → Step 4 review); the single Step 5 verify runs LAST, after every review below.
> 4. **`$spec [mode=sync]`** — *spec-driven closure.* Reconcile the spec's §8 `TC-{FEATURE}-{NNN}` ↔ integration tests and refresh `Evidence: TBD` markers to real `file:line` now that code exists. Run `$spec [mode=tests]` first if the implementation introduced behavior not yet captured as a test case. Skip only when step 1 was skipped (fast-mode trivial, no spec touched).
> 6. **`$changes-review`** — review the diff before commit.
> 7. **`$why-review`** — review rationale and change quality of the implementation.
> 8. **Verify once (Step 5)** — full tests + mutation check on the settled tree, then the documentation update and final report; a fix made here re-runs items 6-7 before the task is done (`SYNC:verify-last-order`).

## First Principle — Easy to Change · Easy to Scale · Easy to Maintain

> The full gate is `SYNC:core-engineering-principles` (protocol guide below; a hook delivers its text); its closing digest ends this file.

---

## Default Mode Policy

> **Default mode HARD (full rigor).** Every section below — deep research, mandatory `$plan`, full `code-reviewer` review, mandatory tests, mandatory `$docs-manager --mode=update` — applies by default.
>
> **Opt out to fast mode ONLY when ALL true** (task genuinely trivial):
>
> - Single-file edit, ≤30 lines changed
> - No design choice (only one reasonable approach)
> - No cross-service impact, no contract change, no new dependency
> - No new pattern — follows existing codebase pattern
> - Existing tests cover change OR change non-functional (typo, comment, log message)
>
> **Any condition fails → use full protocol below.** When in doubt, default hard. Skipping review/tests on non-trivial change ships bugs.
>
> **Fast mode skips (and only skips):** researcher subagent phase (direct grep instead), mandatory `code-reviewer` review (self-review only), separate test phase (verify inline). Does NOT skip `$plan` step, test execution, `$docs-manager --mode=update` triage.

### Backend Context (if applicable)

> When task involves backend changes, read these directly before implementing:

Both docs below sit under the reference-docs root (default `docs/project-reference`; a `docsRoots.projectReference.path` entry in `docs/project-config.json` overrides the path):

- CQRS commands/queries, validation, repositories, entity events: `backend-patterns-reference.md`
- Entity catalog, relationships, cross-service sync: `domain-entities-reference.md`
- **Repository type (service-specific):** when the project declares a per-service repository abstraction (`backendServices.serviceRepositories` in `docs/project-config.json`), use that repository type for the service — NEVER the generic root repository base.

### Frontend/UI Context (if applicable)

> When task involves frontend or UI changes:

All three live under the reference-docs root (default `docs/project-reference`; a `docsRoots.projectReference.path` entry in `docs/project-config.json` overrides the path):

- Component patterns: `frontend-patterns-reference.md`
- Styling reference: `configured styling reference`
- Design system tokens: `design-system/README.md`

**AI surface?** Only if the task creates or changes a model call, prompt, agent, tool/MCP, retrieval or eval (see `node .claude/scripts/ai-signal-scan.cjs`): read `.claude/skills/shared/protocols/ai-engineering-gate.md` and apply it; otherwise skip this line.

**Ultrathink** plan and implement these tasks with maximum verification:

**Be skeptical. Apply critical thinking, sequential thinking. Every claim needs traced proof, confidence >80% to act.**

<tasks>$ARGUMENTS</tasks>

**Mode:** Extra research, detailed planning, mandatory reviews.

## Workflow

### 0. Goal Contract Read (BEFORE implementation)

- Resolve the active Goal Contract per `SYNC:goal-contract-satisfaction-loop`: active plan `goal.md` → `plans/goals/{YYMMDD-HHmm}-{slug}/goal.md` (plans root default `plans/`; `docsRoots.plans.path` in `docs/project-config.json` overrides) → create from the current request via `.claude/templates/goal-contract-template.md`.
- Read the saved success criteria BEFORE any code change — implementation serves the saved criteria, not chat memory.
- After implementation and verification, append an Iteration Log entry to the goal file: result, evidence references (`file:line`, command output), remaining gaps mapped to criteria.

### 1. Deep Research Phase

- Launch 2-3 `researcher` subagents in parallel covering:
    - Technical approach validation
    - Edge cases, failure modes
    - Security implications
    - Performance considerations
- Use `$investigate` for comprehensive codebase analysis
- Research reports max 150 lines each
- **External Memory:** Write all research to `tmp/analysis/{task-name}.analysis.md`. Re-read ENTIRE file before planning.
- **Pre-Implementation Trace Gate:** For bugfix, failed verification, stale/incorrect final output, regression, or behavior-changing fix plans, MUST ATTENTION confirm the plan/referenced analysis includes `Debugger Trace: End -> Start`, all feeder paths, hypothesis matrix, owning fix layer, and forward convergence proof. If missing, STOP and produce the missing-trace list before editing.

> After implementing, verify by grep/read that no related files need updates (optionally `python .claude/scripts/code_graph connections <file> --json` on modified files as a stale-able hint).

### Optional Graph Hint Before Implementation

Optional: when grep and reading files alone may not reveal a high-risk blast radius (shared contract, many callers, cross-module/cross-service flow, public API), the code graph (`.code-graph/graph.db`) can add callers, dependents and impacted tests. Treat it as a hint, NOT proof: the graph can be stale or incomplete (it lags uncommitted edits and unindexed paths) — verify anything that matters by reading the files/grep. Skip it for low-risk or local changes. When it applies, before writing code:

- `python .claude/scripts/code_graph trace <file> --direction both --json` — what calls this code AND what it triggers
- `python .claude/scripts/code_graph trace <file> --direction downstream --json` — all downstream consumers
- May hint at implicit dependencies (bus message consumers, event handlers) — confirm by reading

### 2. Comprehensive Planning

- Use `planner` subagent with all research reports
- Create full plan directory:
    - `plan.md` — overview with risk assessment
    - `phase-XX-*.md` — detailed phase files
    - Success criteria per phase
    - Rollback strategy

### 3. Verified Implementation

- Implement every phase, writing each phase's tests in the same pass as its code
- After each phase:
    - Run type-check, compile ONLY — no test run, no mutation run, no review per phase (`SYNC:verify-last-order`)
    - Self-review before proceeding

### Batch Checkpoint (Large Plans)

For plans with 10+ tasks, execute in batches with human review:

1. **Execute batch** — Complete next 3 tasks (or user-specified size)
2. **Report** — Show implementation, verification output, any concerns
3. **Wait** — Say "Ready for feedback" and STOP. Do NOT continue automatically.
4. **Apply feedback** — Incorporate changes, execute next batch
5. **Repeat** until all tasks complete

<HARD-GATE>
Plans with 10+ tasks — do NOT execute all tasks continuously without checkpoint.
Stop after every batch for human review. Prevents runaway execution where early
mistakes compound through later tasks.
</HARD-GATE>

### 4. Mandatory Code Review (static)

- Use `code-reviewer` subagent over the whole changeset; the review reads code and tests and runs NO test suite
- Apply the canonical review policy: Round 1 exits on zero open validated findings (Round-1 LOW closure);
  Round 2 fixes only validated CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM findings, while
  LOW-only findings are recorded as deferred and do not reopen the loop.
- Failed binary gates (tests, required artifacts, security must-fix, parity)
  block at every round and are never relabeled LOW.
- Start a fresh full review after every fix cycle; a fix may write or amend tests but does not run them.
- Stop when the current round's severity bar is clear; cap at three review rounds and
  escalate repeated/no-progress CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM findings rather than
  looping open-ended.

### 5. Mandatory Verify (tests + mutation check, once)

- Use `tester` subagent ONCE for the full affected suite; then run the mutation check yourself (`tester` is read-only) on every changed core-logic line and new rule
- Tests cover: happy path scenarios, edge cases from research, error handling paths
- NO mocks or fake data
- Any red test or surviving mutant: record the provisional verdict, fix at the owner, re-run until all tests pass and every mutant is killed
- If fixing edited any source or test file, re-run the Step 4 review over the settled tree; a re-review that applies a fix sends you back here (capped at 3 turns, then escalate using ask user tool)
- Done = a green verify AND no edit after the last review; an edit after the last green run invalidates it

### 6. Documentation Update

- Use `docs-manager` to update relevant docs
- Update plan status inline
- Record architectural decisions

### 7. Final Report

- Summary of all changes
- Test coverage metrics
- Security considerations addressed
- Unresolved questions (if any)
- Ask user to review and approve

## When to Use

- Critical production features
- Security-sensitive changes
- Public API modifications
- Database schema changes
- Cross-service integrations

## Quality Gates

| Gate     | Criteria                  |
| -------- | ------------------------- |
| Research | 2+ researcher reports     |
| Planning | Full plan directory       |
| Review   | No blocking findings under the current severity bar; deferred LOWs listed; static, before the verify |
| Tests    | Verified once after the review: all pass, no mocks, every mutant killed |
| Docs     | Updated if needed         |

## Next Steps (Standalone: MUST ATTENTION ask user using ask user tool. Skip only when `nested=true` — a `[Workflow]` row that merely exists in the current task list does not count.)

> **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION — NO EXCEPTIONS:** If this skill was called **outside a workflow**, MUST ATTENTION use ask user tool to present these options. Do NOT skip because task seems "simple" or "obvious" — user decides:

- **"Proceed with full workflow (Recommended)"** — Detect best workflow to continue from here (feature implemented). Ensures review, testing, docs steps aren't skipped.
- **"$code-simplifier"** — Simplify and clean up implementation
- **"$workflow-review-changes"** — Review changes before commit
- **"Skip, continue manually"** — user decides

> If THIS run is a step of a `[Workflow]` row (`nested=true`: its own phase tasks are linked to that parent row; a `[Workflow]` row that merely exists in the current task list, such as an abandoned one, does not count), skip — workflow handles sequencing.

> **[IMPORTANT]** Use task tracking to break ALL work into small tasks BEFORE starting — including tasks for each file read. Prevents context loss from long files. For simple tasks, MUST ATTENTION ask user whether to skip.

- `domain-entities-reference.md` under the reference-docs root (default `docs/project-reference`; `docsRoots.projectReference.path` in `docs/project-config.json` overrides) — Domain entity catalog, relationships, cross-service sync (read when task involves business entities/models)
- The business spec root (default `docs/specs/`; `specRoots.business.path` in `docs/project-config.json` overrides) — Test specifications by module (read existing TCs; generate/update via `$spec [mode=tests]` after implementation)

<!-- PROTOCOL-GUIDES:END -->

<!-- SYNC:severity-rubric:reminder -->

- **MANDATORY** Classify every finding Critical/High/Medium/Low by consequence using the affected asset, shipped impact, exposure, reversibility, evidence location, and confidence; Critical/High/MEDIUM remain actionable under the round bar, while LOW is recorded/deferred from round 2 onward.
- **MANDATORY** A finding names a reachable trigger path (caller, input, state or event that reaches the defect) and a consequence; an unreachable concern is an observation, and unsettled reachability is `NOT VERIFIABLE` only when the concern would be MEDIUM or higher (an observation otherwise) — never a speculative LOW.
- **MANDATORY** Keep binary gates separate from severity: a failed test, security must-fix, required artifact, or parity check blocks at every round and is never relabeled LOW.
- **MANDATORY** Score-based skills (sre 0-2, perf two-axis) map onto the same four tiers — no parallel severity vocabulary.

<!-- /SYNC:severity-rubric:reminder -->

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** debugger trace gate: for non-trivial bug/fix/investigation/review work, start at the observed final output and trace backward through reader -> storage/projection -> writer -> consumer/job -> producer/trigger. Enumerate all feeder paths and hypotheses before fixing; select the authoritative invariant owner from project architecture and retain validation at untrusted boundaries. **BLOCKED until** trace, hypothesis matrix, owning fix layer, and forward convergence proof exist.

<!-- SYNC:design-distinctiveness-gate:reminder -->

- **MUST ATTENTION** apply the design distinctiveness gate (`DD-1`–`DD-8`) to any user-facing visual surface: ground it in the named subject/audience/job and confirm when the brief is silent (`DD-1`) · every choice carries a WHY, token names included (`DD-2`) · write a design plan (colour 4–6 named hex · type families+roles+scale · layout prose+ASCII+alignment · principles) then run the BLOCKING generic test and state what you revised BEFORE coding (`DD-3`) · audit every free axis against the T1–T5 tell catalog — cream+serif+`#D97757`, acid-on-black, broadsheet, the SaaS-card kit, template chrome (ALL-CAPS eyebrows, `A · B · C`, spaced-em-dash labels, `#0B0B0B`, mono data labels, trailing `→`) — a match is a missed decision, never a defect (`DD-4`) · 1–2 clearly distinct families, real scale, <80ch, no single-word headline accent / ALL-CAPS labels / redundant eyebrows (`DD-5`) · numbering only on real sequences; hero = the subject's most characteristic thing, not big-number+gradient (`DD-6`) · one orchestrated motion moment, never per-section entrances plus universal card hovers (`DD-7`) · spend boldness once, critique the BUILT page, remove one accessory (`DD-8`). The brief's stated direction OUTRANKS the tell catalog; project design-system docs OUTRANK these clauses — genuine conflicts go to the user, NEVER resolved silently. Cite findings as `DD-<clause>` + `file:line`. Skip ONLY for surfaces with no user-facing visuals, stated explicitly.

<!-- SYNC:design-review-checklist:reminder -->

- **MUST ATTENTION** when the change/plan/artifact has an applicable user-facing UI surface, READ `.claude/docs/design-review-checklist.md` and run it: `CL-1` establish context first (platform · user · task · metric · constraints · scope · artifacts — state missing context and its confidence impact) · `CL-2` evidence or nothing, cite a location per finding, NEVER invent a measurement (unmeasurable → `NOT VERIFIABLE`), tag `MEASURED`/`OBSERVED`/`HEURISTIC` · `CL-3` rank `P0`–`P4`, cap at top 10 by severity, NEVER pad, concrete fix on every `P0`/`P1` · `CL-4` sweep §A–§N plus §R over whole surfaces (changed files → affected views, composition reconstructed, render or `ENVIRONMENT-BLOCKED`), including surface load B12–B15, container fit E9–E11, §H by usage, Field Necessity Matrix for input, applying only relevant platform/product sections and the WCAG 2.2 AA web baseline plus any stricter applicable legal/project requirement, or the documented standard for other platforms · `CL-5` short on time → use the §P prompts · `CL-6` report in the §O shape · for source code, assess component ownership, base abstractions, reuse, and duplication using the project's documented taxonomy or observed boundaries. Project design-system docs and ADRs OUTRANK the checklist; report a defect ONCE across `UI-*`/`DD-*`/`CL-*`. For a plan, bind only applicable sections and states to acceptance criteria, and name each UI view's primary task, container, information priority, and creation-vs-deferred inputs; a plan review flags a UI phase that omits them. Skip when the work has no user-facing UI surface, and state why.

<!-- SYNC:measured-capacity-engineering:reminder -->

**MUST ATTENTION** capacity work: model demand/SLO and distinguish sessions from RPS/in-flight work; disclose load model and offered vs achieved demand; reduce measured work at a safe owner; preserve cache authorization/freshness/bounds; prove cold-state, overload recovery and justified headroom before scaling. Static review returns a verification plan, not invented throughput. Retain the hosting skill's scores, gates and authority.

## Closing Reminders

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION Goal:** Ship a correct, fully-verified feature that satisfies the saved Goal Contract — implemented with deep research, comprehensive planning, and maximum quality verification (planned, reviewed, tested, documented) — with no skipped quality gate on any non-trivial change.

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** follow the pipeline in order: resolve the Goal Contract → decide/create/sync the spec → research and trace → author and review the plan → implement every phase with its tests (compile only between phases) → static review fix-loop until the current severity bar is clear → run spec sync, changes-review, and why-review (static) → run full tests + mutation check once, LAST, fix and re-run to green, re-review only if that edited anything → update docs/status → emit the final evidence report; use fast mode only when every opt-out condition passes.

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION — Protocols in force (concise digest of the SYNC/shared blocks this skill carries; each line is a signpost to its canonical body above):**

- **End-To-Start Debugger Trace:** Trace observed output backward through every feeder path before fixing.
- **Source/Test Drift Check:** When source behavior changes, reconcile affected tests from evidence.
- **UI System Context:** Read frontend, SCSS, and design-system docs before any UI change.
- **Graph-Assisted Investigation (optional):** the code graph is a stale-able hint for high-risk blast radius, never required.
- **Nested Task Creation:** Expand child phase tasks and link the parent when nested.
- **Task Tracking External Report:** Bootstrap task tracking; persist plan/review findings incrementally to disk.
- **Understand Code First:** Search 3+ patterns and read code before any modification.
- **Plan Quality:** Add `## Test Specifications` with TC IDs to every plan phase.

- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** default mode HARD — opt out to fast mode ONLY when ALL trivial-task conditions met
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** break work into small todo tasks via task tracking BEFORE starting
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** search codebase for 3+ similar patterns before creating new code
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** cite `file:line` evidence for every claim (confidence >80% to act)
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** add final review todo task to verify work quality
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** validate decisions with user using ask user tool — never auto-decide
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** NEVER skip `code-reviewer` review or test execution on non-trivial change

**[TASK-PLANNING]** Before acting, analyze task scope and systematically break into small todo tasks and sub-tasks via task tracking.

**MUST ATTENTION** Core Engineering Principles — every plan, implementation and review must be **Easy to change** (reuse first, one owner per rule, interfaces/adapters at volatile boundaries, no speculative abstraction) · **Easy to scale** (extend by addition, bounded growth, explicit boundaries, sized to the project's real profile) · **Easy to maintain** (intent-named tests that fail when the rule breaks across happy/error/edge paths; harness green locally and in CI). Before done: next change → how many edit sites? 10× → what breaks? which test goes red?

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** code-changing work runs tests ONCE, last: build all phases + write tests → static review fix-loop → verify once with mutation check → fix and re-run to green → re-review only if step 4 edited anything. No per-phase or in-review test runs.
