## Codex Project-Reference Loading (Hook-Independent)

Claude and Codex use static project-reference loading as the authority; hooks may accelerate discovery but never replace the explicit read.
When coding, planning, debugging, testing, or reviewing, open project docs explicitly using this routing.

**Always read:**
- `docs/project-config.json` (project-specific paths, commands, modules, and workflow/test settings)
- `docs/project-reference/docs-index-reference.md` (routes to the full `docs/project-reference/*` catalog)
- `docs/project-reference/lessons.md` (always-on guardrails and anti-patterns)

**Missing/stale context route:** If `docs/project-config.json`, the docs index, `lessons.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, or any task-required reference doc is missing or stale, auto-run `$project-init` or the narrow setup route (`$project-config`, `$docs-init`, `$scan-all`, `$scan --target=<key>`, `$ai-context-refresh`) before ordinary project-specific work. A full `$sync-codex` run preflights `CLAUDE.md`; a completed `$ai-context-refresh` run may invoke the standalone runner with `--skip=claude-md` after final source edits. Markerless roots need AI smart-merge unless `portability.requireUniversalGuides: false` is explicit.

**Situation-based docs:**
- Project structure/architecture/tech-stack/deployment/setup (any layer — backend, frontend, or infra): `project-structure-reference.md`
- Backend/CQRS/API/domain/entity changes: `backend-patterns-reference.md`, `domain-entities-reference.md`
- Frontend/UI/styling/design-system: `frontend-patterns-reference.md`, `configured styling reference`, `design-system/README.md`
- Spec authoring, `docs/specs/` pathing, or TC format: `feature-spec-reference.md`, `spec-system-reference.md`, `spec-principles.md`
- Behavior/public-contract changes or spec-test-code sync: `workflow-spec-test-code-cycle-reference.md` plus the spec docs above
- Derived spec indexes/ERDs/reimplementation guides: `spec-system-reference.md` and source Feature Specs under `docs/specs/`
- Integration test implementation/review: `integration-test-reference.md`
- E2E test implementation/review: `e2e-test-reference.md`
- Code review/audit work: `code-review-rules.md` plus domain docs above based on changed files

Do not read all docs blindly. Start from `docs-index-reference.md`, then open only relevant files for the task.

## Quick Summary

**Goal:** [Workflow] Trigger Big Feature workflow — research-driven development for large, complex, or ambiguous features needing market research, business evaluation, domain analysis, tech stack research, and architecture design before implementation.

**Summary:**

- Apply the shared four-operand `isLargeIdea` rule before research and planning; large ideas carry the complete decomposition block in PBIs/specs and downstream presentation/mock-up artifacts. Run `$scenario` before the first plan when the slice/risk context requires it; do not create a roadmap artifact by default.
- At `$architecture-design` before PLAN₁, apply `SYNC:scale-ready-foundation`: inspect the existing project, distinguish safe adoption from conflicts and broad refactors, and emit the applicability/decision matrix for architecture, actors/authorization, dependencies/licenses, real infrastructure boundaries, supported execution modes, CI/operations, and UI when applicable.
- For brownfield gaps, preserve the bounded actor-facing outcome; use `ADAPT-IN-SLICE`, `DEFER-AS-OPPORTUNITY`, `NOT-APPLICABLE`, or `BLOCKED` with evidence, owner, trigger, and smallest valuable next step. Do not silently turn a feature PBI into a broad refactor.
- Optional AI-agent-as-user advice: when the feature has an evidenced agent actor or machine-integration opportunity, apply `SYNC:ai-agent-as-user-access`; inspect existing setup and reuse, adapt, defer, record `NOT-APPLICABLE`, or block with evidence without silently expanding the feature.
- Every assertion-bearing test handled by this workflow MUST use the project's configured/native test style and clearly identify the protected behavior or technical contract plus its owned outcome. Use explicit `Given` → `When` → `Then` when selected by the project/spec or when it fits the existing test idiom; preserve established alternatives such as AAA or `describe`/`it`.
- Keep research, architecture, specs, PBIs, and implementation downstream of the product boundary; preserve explicit non-goals and human decisions.
- Every generated PBI in this workflow MUST pass the Releasable Outcome Gate: one independently releasable actor-facing outcome with a complete entry-to-result journey; technical/foundation/setup work is attached enabling work, never a standalone PBI. UI PBIs require the full page/view, navigation, component, state, and mock-app flow surface.
- Execute the canonical steps in order, with reviewed scaffolding before feature work and evidence-backed verification at the end.

 - **Main steps:** classify/decompose → research/evaluate → domain/architecture/scenario → plan/review → PBI/story/mock-up/spec gates → scaffold/review/reference refresh → implementation/integration verification → final review → required near-end `workflow-e2e` verification → security/test/docs/handoff.

**Workflow:**

1. **Detect** — classify request scope and target artifacts.
2. **Execute** — apply required steps with evidence-backed actions.
3. **Verify** — confirm constraints, output quality, and completion evidence.

**Key Rules:**

- MUST ATTENTION keep claims evidence-based (`file:line`) with confidence >80% to act.
- MUST ATTENTION keep task tracking updated as each step starts/completes.
- MUST ATTENTION define success criteria before execution and loop until observable verification passes.
- MUST ATTENTION when creating/reviewing specs or tests, name `Business Intent / Invariant Guarded` or the protected business intent/invariant and ensure the test would fail if that intent breaks.
- MUST ATTENTION classify the idea with `isLargeIdea = multipleIndependentOutcomes || ambiguousOrResearchHeavy || releaseScopeDecomposition || oversizedPbiThatMustSplit` before research, specs, PBIs, or plans. When true, require `outcome_slices`, `dependencies_order`, `non_goals`, `risks_evidence`, and `deferred_work_owner`; run `$scenario` conditionally for the embedded scope. An existing roadmap is read-only context and only an explicit roadmap request enters the standalone writer.
- MUST ATTENTION before PLAN₁ emit the `SYNC:scale-ready-foundation` matrix and carry its accepted decisions into `$architecture-design`, `$plan`, `$scaffold`, `$architecture-review-full`, and implementation; use the full gate for greenfield and the fit/defer branch for this existing-project workflow.
- MUST ATTENTION optionally evaluate AI agents as first-class non-human actors when evidence or an accepted future contract makes them relevant; apply `SYNC:ai-agent-as-user-access`, select only warranted API/CLI/MCP/WebMCP/event/SDK surfaces over one capability core, and record the status, owner, trigger, and smallest next step without scope laundering.
- MUST ATTENTION every assertion-bearing test follows the configured/native test style and makes the protected behavior/contract plus owned outcome clear; use GWT when selected by the project/spec or when it fits the established idiom. Preserve brownfield conventions and record broad format migration as an owned opportunity; safety-critical ambiguity is `BLOCKED`.
- MUST ATTENTION when a desired foundation requires broad refactoring, keep the releasable PBI's actor journey bounded and record a separately owned refactor/architecture opportunity with rationale, dependency order, trigger, owner, cost of delay, and smallest independently valuable next step; mark the current slice `BLOCKED` when the refactor is required for safety.
- NEVER skip mandatory workflow or skill gates.

## Repeated Steps Disambiguation (CRITICAL for task creation)

This workflow has steps that appear multiple times. When creating tasks, use these descriptions to distinguish them:

| Step           | Occurrence   | Task Description                                                                  |
| -------------- | ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `$plan`        | 1st (pos 14) | PLAN₁: High-level architecture plan (after architecture-design and scenario gate) |
| `$plan`        | 2nd (pos 27) | PLAN₂: Sprint-ready implementation plan (after artifact-review --type=spec-tests) |
| `$plan-review` | 1st (pos 15) | Review PLAN₁ architecture                                                         |
| `$plan-review` | 2nd (pos 28) | Review PLAN₂ implementation                                                       |

**NEVER deduplicate** — each occurrence is a distinct task with a different purpose.

## Market Analysis Applicability (pos 4, conditional)

Run condition (verbatim from the registry): The work has a commercial market and either this product's addressable market is not already sized or this feature changes that sizing.

Skip reason (verbatim from the registry): This scope has no commercial market to size (for example, an internal tool, migration, or infrastructure-only change), or this product's addressable market is already sized and unchanged by this feature.

For either outcome, record the applicability evidence. If skipped because the market is already sized, cite the existing analysis. `$business-evaluation` must mark every market-sizing figure N/A with the exact skip reason and must not re-derive sizing. Skipping this occurrence never waives `$web-research`, `$deep-research`, other selected research stages, or their required user confirmations.


## Architecture Gates Parallel Phase (`architecture-scalability-review` + design-rationale `$why-review`)

Declared as the `architecture-gates` all-return barrier in `workflows.json`. Both gates read the same finished `$architecture-design` artifacts and neither consumes the other's output:

1. Launch `$architecture-scalability-review` FIRST as a fresh read-only `architect` sub-agent (brief: architecture-design, domain-analysis and tech-stack-research artifact paths). It writes its scorecard to `tmp/reports/` and validates its own sub-80 findings.
2. Immediately run the design-rationale `$why-review` INLINE in FULL mode over the architecture-design rationale — inline so its Trade-Off Interrogation Gate can reach the user.
3. Advance only after BOTH return. Reconcile: a scalability risk or sub-80 grade touching a decision the why-review passed becomes a WARN carried into `$scenario` and PLAN₁; a why-review FAIL — or a user Trade-Off answer that changes an architecture decision — blocks `$scenario` until the decision is revised, then re-run both gates.

## Foundation Reference Doc Refresh (pos 31–34, conditional)

New foundations need project references BEFORE feature fan-out. After `$architecture-review-full` and before `$plan-validate` → `$plan-execute`:

1. **When `$scaffold` ran**, run `$scan --target=ui-system` → `$scan --target=backend-patterns` → `$scan --target=integration-tests` → `$scan --target=project-structure` INLINE in that order — each scan fans out its own sub-agents from the orchestrator, so a scan is never dispatched as a sub-agent (`stepMeta` marks them `inline`). The four scans write disjoint reference docs and consume the reviewed-and-fixed foundation, so they run sequentially, not as a parallel barrier.
2. **Refresh, not regenerate** — this is an existing codebase: each scan reads the existing doc in the project-reference docs root (default `docs/project-reference/`; a `docsRoots.projectReference.path` entry in `docs/project-config.json` overrides the path) first and surgically adds what the foundation introduced (new base abstractions, golden-path examples, the isolated examples tree, a new module, UI foundation), creating a doc only when it does not exist yet and preserving unchanged sections and manual annotations.
3. **Skip rules** — skip `$scan --target=ui-system` (log the reason) when `$scaffold` created no UI/frontend foundation; the other three apply whenever `$scaffold` ran. When `$scaffold` was skipped (existing foundation reused), mark all four completed with a cited skip reason — the existing reference docs already describe that foundation.
4. If `$plan-validate` or a later pre-implementation fix changes the foundation, re-run every `$scan` whose reference doc covers the changed area before `$plan-execute`.

---

## Closing Rule

Every non-skipped step = `TaskUpdate in_progress` → skill invocation → complete skill → `TaskUpdate completed`. A cited conditional skip explicitly authorized by the canonical `sequence[].applicability` or an explicit workflow-specific gate in `preActions.injectContext` may complete without a skill call.

**IMPORTANT MANDATORY Steps:** $idea -> $web-research -> $deep-research -> $market-analysis -> $business-evaluation -> $spec-discovery -> $domain-analysis -> $why-review -> $tech-stack-research -> $architecture-design -> $architecture-scalability-review -> $why-review -> $scenario -> $plan -> $plan-review -> $refine -> $artifact-review --type=pbi -> $story -> $artifact-review --type=story -> $pbi-challenge -> $dor-gate -> $pbi-mockup -> $spec -> $spec [mode=tests] -> $artifact-review --type=spec-tests -> $spec-clarify -> $plan -> $plan-review -> $scaffold -> $architecture-review-full -> $scan --target=ui-system -> $scan --target=backend-patterns -> $scan --target=integration-tests -> $scan --target=project-structure -> $plan-validate -> $plan-execute -> $seed-test-data -> $integration-test -> $integration-test-verify -> $spec [mode=sync] -> $workflow-review-changes -> $workflow-e2e --source=context -> $test -> $workflow-end -> $watzup

**IMPORTANT MANDATORY Steps:** $idea -> $web-research -> $deep-research -> $market-analysis -> $business-evaluation -> $spec-discovery -> $domain-analysis -> $why-review -> $tech-stack-research -> $architecture-design -> $architecture-scalability-review -> $why-review -> $scenario -> $plan -> $plan-review -> $refine -> $artifact-review --type=pbi -> $story -> $artifact-review --type=story -> $pbi-challenge -> $dor-gate -> $pbi-mockup -> $spec -> $spec [mode=tests] -> $artifact-review --type=spec-tests -> $spec-clarify -> $plan -> $plan-review -> $scaffold -> $architecture-review-full -> $scan --target=ui-system -> $scan --target=backend-patterns -> $scan --target=integration-tests -> $scan --target=project-structure -> $plan-validate -> $plan-execute -> $seed-test-data -> $integration-test -> $integration-test-verify -> $spec [mode=sync] -> $workflow-review-changes -> $workflow-e2e --source=context -> $test -> $workflow-end -> $watzup

> **[BLOCKING]** Each non-skipped step MUST ATTENTION invoke its skill invocation — marking a task `completed` without skill invocation is a workflow violation, except a cited conditional skip explicitly authorized by the canonical `sequence[].applicability` or an explicit workflow-specific gate in `preActions.injectContext`. NEVER batch-complete validation gates.

Activate the `workflow-big-feature` workflow. Run `$start-workflow workflow-big-feature` with the user's prompt as context.

> **Spec check (before investigation):** If the business spec root (default `docs/specs/`; a `specRoots.business.path` entry in `docs/project-config.json` overrides the path) has a spec for the affected service/module, read the relevant ERD + business-rules + API-contracts files FIRST. Engineering specs provide domain context that reduces investigation time significantly. Command: list that resolved root to discover available app buckets or flat system folders; then probe its `{app-bucket}/` or `{system-name}/` subdirectory to find the specific service spec.

<!-- SYNC:scale-ready-foundation -->

> **Scale-Ready Foundation & Brownfield Fit** — Use this protocol only in `workflow-greenfield-init` and `workflow-big-feature`; it supplements, never replaces, `SYNC:engineering-foundation-gate`, `SYNC:scale-technique-gate`, `SYNC:design-system-check`, and `shared/sdd-artifact-contract.md`. Optimize for a system that can grow and change safely, not for a fashionable architecture.
>
> 1. **Classify lifecycle and evidence first.** Mark `G` greenfield (foundation being created) or `B` brownfield (existing project); record scale `T0`–`T3`, business criticality `B0`–`B3`, repository/module shape, user-facing surfaces, and current setup with `file:line`/config/CI evidence. Unknowns stay explicit and take the lower warranted tier; never invent a greenfield baseline for an existing project.
> 2. **Choose the smallest architecture that satisfies measured needs.** For a greenfield business application, evaluate a modular monolith when one release boundary fits and there is no evidenced need to split deployment, scaling, compliance, availability, or runtime; select it only when its boundaries fit the domain and operating constraints. Preserve accepted decisions and architecture on brownfield work unless a requirement justifies a reviewed migration. Evaluate Clean/Hexagonal, DDD, and event-driven patterns only where their preconditions fit; add distributed services, event sourcing, sagas, or other costly machinery only for a named need. Record dependency direction, data ownership at service boundaries, and any useful decomposition trigger.
> 3. **Make applicable module boundaries cheap to change.** When the project has modules or bounded capabilities, name their responsibilities and contracts; organize business modules around capabilities where that matches the domain, not merely tables, vendors, or technical layers. Respect the configured in-process and service boundaries; do not bypass another independently owned service's private data contract. Keep shared libraries domain-neutral, and add boundary checks when they are useful and supported by the stack.
> 4. **Design authorization from actors, not a role enum.** For SaaS or multi-tenant scope, enumerate applicable human, organization, platform, service-account, integration, webhook, and background-job actors (for example: visitor, member, tenant administrator, support/operator, platform administrator, service identity); derive the list from the product and threat model rather than assuming it. For every actor record authentication, tenant/resource scope, actions, role assignment/delegation, deny-by-default and least privilege, separation of duties, admin/impersonation/break-glass controls, and audit evidence. Verify allowed, denied, and cross-tenant isolation paths.
> 5. **Keep infrastructure replaceable without leaking vendors.** Put each real external boundary behind a purpose-named port/interface and provider adapter; keep SDK, framework, database, queue, and transport types out of domain/application contracts; compose implementations at the outer boundary; and add abstractions only where a real boundary or substitution need exists. A claimed swap must identify the stable contract, migration seam, and remaining provider-specific cost.
> 6. **Research new or materially changed dependencies and enforce the cost constraint.** Compare current authoritative evidence for fit, maintenance, security, interoperability, upgrade path, license obligations, and total cost. Respect existing approved dependencies unless the change reopens them. When the requirement is free/no paid license, reject paid license or usage-fee choices unless the user explicitly approves an exception; verify upstream license text and machine-readable SPDX metadata. Record material attribution, copyleft/patent/redistribution obligations, and operating costs; do not turn dependency inventory into speculative replacement work.
> 7. **Make the supported execution and operations reproducible.** Identify the project's required developer, test, and deployment modes from its runtime, team, CI, and target platform. Use one source of truth for shared configuration/topology; when both host and container modes are supported or required, exercise both. Use containers/Compose when they fit the project or its dependencies; document and verify the supported native, device, managed, or other mode when containerization does not fit. Plan CI/CD, migrations, rollback, observability, runbooks, and recovery according to project scale, risk, platform, and data durability; mark irrelevant capabilities `NOT-APPLICABLE` with evidence.
> 8. **Treat each user-facing surface as part of its product.** When UI design decisions need references, use current examples appropriate to the target platform, audience, and domain; record the source, access date, observed pattern, fit, and what was rejected. Define visual language, interaction states, accessibility, and responsive behavior only where relevant to the surface. Follow the project's configured design system and component/module ownership; if none exists, document the actual owners and the smallest useful conventions without inventing tiers, wrapper contracts, tokens, or breakpoints. Reuse components when they fit; never copy a reference site's assets or code without permission.
> 9. **Rank by ROI and reversibility.** For each principle, compare 2–3 viable approaches when the decision is hard to reverse; record benefits, sacrifices, change cost, risk if skipped, cost of delay, and measurable revisit trigger. Distinguish `APPLY-NOW`, `ADAPT-IN-SLICE`, `DEFER-AS-OPPORTUNITY`, `NOT-APPLICABLE`, and `BLOCKED`; a named pattern without an applicability decision is incomplete.
> 10. **Handle brownfield gaps without scope laundering.** If the current project already has setup, inspect what can be adopted safely, what conflicts with accepted decisions, and what cannot be applied without broad refactoring. Keep the requested actor-facing outcome bounded; mark safe parts `ADAPT-IN-SLICE`, and record broad work as a separately owned architecture/refactor opportunity with scope, rationale, dependency order, trigger, smallest independently valuable next step, owner, and cost of delay. Attach only enabling work needed by the releasable outcome; if the outcome cannot be safe without the refactor, mark it `BLOCKED` and escalate instead of silently expanding the ticket.
> 11. **Greenfield handoff is blocking for warranted foundation decisions.** Before the first implementation plan completes, carry the matrix, accepted decisions, applicable actor/permission model, dependency/license choices, module/boundary map, real external ports, supported execution commands, CI/CD and operations plan, and UI decisions when applicable into architecture, scaffold, harness, and plan artifacts. A warranted omission needs evidence and an owner-visible disposition; do not require host/Compose modes, modules, UI, or infrastructure that the project does not use.

<!-- /SYNC:scale-ready-foundation -->

<!-- SYNC:ai-agent-as-user-access -->

> **AI Agent as a First-Class User / Machine-Interaction Contract** — Strong recommendation when creating a greenfield system; optional, evidence-gated advice for a big feature or architecture review. Treat an AI agent as a potential non-human actor with its own identity, authority, tenancy, safety policy, and observable outcomes — not as a trusted administrator or UI automation shortcut. This supplements, never replaces, the shared authorization, API, security, and test contracts.
>
> 1. **Classify the actor and relationship.** From product and threat-model evidence, identify agent personas (user-delegated copilot, tenant automation, platform operator, service agent, integration agent), the human or organization it may act for, tenant/resource scope, trust level, allowed autonomy, data/action budgets, and human approval points. An agent is not automatically the human, tenant administrator, or platform administrator.
> 2. **Make one application capability core.** Express business use cases in a stable application boundary reused by human UI and machine surfaces. API, CLI, MCP, WebMCP, webhook/event, SDK, or batch adapters may translate contracts, but must not duplicate domain rules or bypass validation/authentication/authorization. Name and version contracts by purpose, use machine-readable input/output schemas, stable error codes, idempotency for retries, pagination or asynchronous status where needed, timeouts/cancellation, correlation IDs, quotas/rate limits, and deprecation policy.
> 3. **Choose surfaces by evidence.** Use API/OpenAPI for remote machine integrations (`https://spec.openapis.org/oas/latest.html`); CLI for local/operator/automation; MCP for LLM-host discovery of tools, resources, and prompts; WebMCP for a browser-integrated agent when an applicable browser/runtime supports it; webhooks/events for push integration; SDK only when it lowers consumer cost. Evaluate relevant surface(s) and record `APPLY-NOW`, `ADAPT-IN-SLICE`, `DEFER-AS-OPPORTUNITY`, `NOT-APPLICABLE`, or `BLOCKED`; never build all surfaces without a user/job and owner.
> 4. **MCP contract.** When MCP is applicable, expose least-privilege, capability-oriented tools/resources/prompts over currently supported transports (stdio for local, Streamable HTTP for remote, or another explicitly justified adapter). Tool names and descriptions are concise and truthful; input/output schemas, structured results/errors, pagination, deterministic discovery, progress/cancellation, long-running task polling, idempotency, and audit/tool-call IDs are explicit. Use the official specification (`https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/`) and authorization guidance (`https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/basic/authorization`) as the current protocol references.
> 5. **WebMCP is progressive enhancement.** When a web surface and browser-agent support exist, expose narrow page capabilities through the current WebMCP draft API behind a project-owned adapter; never make the domain or primary API contract depend on a draft/browser-only feature. Register only safe, purpose-named tools, validate at server-side/application boundaries, and test direct tool execution against the UI path. Treat tool metadata, page content, and tool output as untrusted input; defend against prompt/output injection and confused-deputy behavior. The official WebMCP page currently labels the proposal a Draft Community Group Report, not a W3C Standard or Standards Track feature (`https://webmachinelearning.github.io/webmcp/`).
> 6. **Secure every agent path.** Give agents distinct authentication and authorization. Resolve delegated human, organization, service-account, or integration identity; enforce deny-by-default, least privilege, tenant/resource scope, action-specific permissions, expiry/revocation, rate/usage budgets, replay/idempotency protection, and separation of duties at the application boundary. No agent self-granting, client-supplied role/tenant claims, privilege escalation, or inbound-token passthrough to downstream services. High-impact, destructive, financial, or privacy-sensitive actions require explicit consent, preview/dry-run, or step-up policy unless an approved autonomous policy says otherwise.
> 7. **Make consent and audit inspectable.** Record who/what acted (agent identity, delegating principal, tenant, client/host, model/session/run where available), capability/tool/action, redacted inputs, policy/consent decision, result/error, correlation ID, and timestamp. Provide discoverable scopes, tool permissions, revoke/rotate paths, and human-visible confirmation for high-impact actions. Keep agent output/data boundaries and retention explicit.
> 8. **Operate it like a product surface.** Document onboarding/discovery, credentials, environment, schema/version compatibility, examples, rate/timeout/error behavior, partial-failure/retry semantics, long-running jobs, support/deprecation, and safe rollback. Monitor adoption, denied calls, latency, errors, retries, quota/cost, sensitive-data exposure signals, and anomalous behavior; provide runbooks and kill/revoke controls.
> 9. **Test the contract and equivalence.** Every agent-facing contract test names the business intent/technical contract and expresses its preconditions, action, and owned outcome in the project's native test format; Given/When/Then is one option. Verify allowed/denied/cross-tenant paths, schema compatibility, the same outcome as the human/API path, idempotent retries/replay, prompt/output injection, unsafe tool descriptions, authorization expiry/revocation, pagination, timeout/cancellation, rate limits, and audit records. Assert the outcome owned by the application, not only tool-call or transport bookkeeping.
> 10. **Apply lifecycle scope correctly.** Greenfield must produce an agent actor/access matrix, selected surfaces and rationale, capability contracts, threat/consent model, test/observability plan, and explicit owner before the first implementation plan; a warranted omission requires an explicit decision/acceptance. Big-feature and architecture-review use this as optional advice: inspect existing setup and advise only when agent use is evidenced or a future contract is accepted; safely adapt in the slice, or create an owned `DEFER-AS-OPPORTUNITY` with owner, trigger, dependency order, smallest next step, and cost of delay. If safety/correctness requires the work, mark `BLOCKED`; never silently turn a feature into an agent-platform refactor.
>
> **Required output:** `agent/persona | relationship/delegation | identity/authn | tenant/resource scope | capabilities/actions | selected surface(s) | contract/version | consent/safety | observability/audit | status/owner/next step | acceptance/revisit trigger`.
>
> **BLOCKED until (when applicable/selected):** actor and authority are explicit · each exposed capability has an owner, schema, authz, safety policy, and observable outcome · the selected API/CLI/MCP/WebMCP adapter reuses the application capability core · allowed/denied/cross-tenant paths and high-impact controls are tested · version/discovery/rollback/telemetry are planned · greenfield omissions are explicitly accepted; otherwise record evidence-backed `NOT-APPLICABLE` or `DEFER-AS-OPPORTUNITY`.

> **FAILED-TEST GATE.** For any failed or unstable test, use the project's test-investigation protocol before editing source or tests; never change either side merely to force green.
> **Re-read files after context changes.** Context compaction, resume, or long-running work can make memory stale; verify current files before acting.
> **Verify generated content against source evidence.** AI hallucinates APIs, names, claims, and document facts. Check the relevant source before documenting or referencing.
> **Check downstream references before deleting or renaming.** Removing an artifact can stale docs, generated mirrors, configs, and callers; map references first.
> **Trace the full impact chain after edits.** Changing a definition can miss derived outputs and consumers. Follow the affected chain before declaring done.
> **Verify ALL affected outputs, not just the first.** One green check is not all green checks; validate every output surface the change can affect.
> **Assume existing values are intentional — ask WHY before changing OR flagging one as a defect.** Before changing or reporting a constant, limit, flag, cutoff, wording, or pattern, read nearby context and history, the CALLER's ordering, and 2+ sibling call sites of the same convention. A doc stating WHAT without WHY is missing rationale, not proof of a missing guard.
> **Surface ambiguity before acting — don't pick silently.** Multiple valid interpretations require an explicit question or stated assumption with risk.
> **Assert the outcome your system owns, not the intermediate state your infrastructure owns.** When verifying async work, assert the final business state — never the delivery/retry bookkeeping held in shared infrastructure that any co-running process can write. Such a check passes when run alone and flakes the moment anything else shares that infrastructure.
> **Store disposable generated output in the project workspace.** If an output can be regenerated and is not source code, a canonical source-of-truth, or an intentionally versioned projection, write it under the project-root `tmp/` or `temp/` directory (prefer `tmp/`), scoped to the run. This includes temporary state, integration/E2E results, reports, logs, screenshots, traces, videos, coverage, dumps, and candidate evidence. Never put these outputs in source, docs, the plans root (default `plans/`; a `docsRoots.plans.path` entry in `docs/project-config.json` overrides the path), the team-artifacts root (default `team-artifacts/`; `docsRoots.teamArtifacts.path` in the same config overrides the path), or mirror directories; the project-root `.gitignore` must ignore `/tmp/` and `/temp/` by default. Committed fixtures, accepted baselines, canonical specs/docs, and explicitly versioned generated mirrors remain at their declared owner paths.
> **Judge the environment before judging the code.** A bug report, failed test, error, or unexpected output is not proof of a code defect. Before and during adjudication, weigh environment causes as a competing hypothesis — setup, config, version and dependency state, service dependencies, stale artifacts or leftover state, and transient resource pressure (RAM, CPU, disk, handles, network). State the discriminator you ran; fix an environment cause in the environment, never by editing product code or weakening a test to absorb it.
> **Keep shared guidance role-relevant.** Universal guidance must help every receiving skill or agent; code-specific obligations belong only in code-specific protocols.

<!-- /SYNC:critical-thinking-mindset -->

<!-- SYNC:incremental-persistence -->

> **Incremental Result Persistence** — MANDATORY for every visual-artifact review and for all sub-agents or heavy inline steps processing >3 files.
>
> 1. **Before starting:** Create report file `tmp/reports/{skill}-{date}-{slug}.md` and record Run ID, Task ID, Attempt ID, target scope, and target fingerprint. When visual artifacts are in scope, also record their ordered inventory and total; identify each screenshot, image, photo, or snapshot by path/name plus state and viewport when known.
> 2. **Checkpoint each review unit:** After each file or section, append findings, evidence, changed paths, and gaps immediately. For visual artifacts, open exactly ONE artifact, inspect it, and append its record BEFORE opening the next artifact. Each record includes artifact identity, state/viewport, inspection status, observations, severity-tagged issues with evidence, an explicit `none` when no issue exists, and any gap. NEVER batch multiple visual artifacts into one later write and never hold their findings in memory.
> 2a. **Resume from disk:** Treat the report's artifact records as the progress ledger. After interruption or context loss, read the report, derive processed and remaining artifacts from the ordered inventory, and continue at the first unprocessed artifact without duplicating completed records.
> 3. **Delegated return:** A sub-agent emits only the structured `SYNC:subagent-return-contract` envelope with exact totals, salient Critical/High findings (maximum ten), current attempt, and `Full report:` path. **Inline user-facing output:** Preserve the skill's requested explanation or teaching, with links to the persisted evidence; the delegated transport limit does not replace that deliverable. Do not paste a full review report into an envelope.
> 4. **Parent synthesis from persisted evidence:** The main agent reads the full report for synthesis, acceptance, deduplication, and repair planning — not only when a named blocker exists. For visual review, reconcile the ordered inventory against the artifact records before concluding; a missing record is incomplete review, never a clean result. Preserve all severities beyond the transport cap.
> 5. **Read-only boundary:** A read-only leaf may write its report/repair proposal but MUST NOT edit source, generated output, or user data; the parent/owner performs repairs after acceptance.
> 6. **Advancement gate:** The parent records `ACCEPTED` for the current Attempt ID only after reconciling target, totals, gaps, and changed paths; stale or late attempts cannot advance dependent work.
>
> **Why:** Context cutoff mid-execution loses ALL in-memory findings, and a large image set makes a final batch write especially fragile. Each per-unit disk write survives compaction. Partial results are better than no results, while explicit identity prevents a late result or a resumed image from being mistaken for the current run.

> 2. **Track every prompt.** Keep `User prompts this session: P1…Pn` — one line per user prompt or input, marked `extends` / `narrows` / `changes` / `answers`. A prompt that changes direction updates the goal explicitly — never silently.
> 3. **Re-anchor.** Re-read the original goal and the prompt list at every workflow step, before delegating (the sub-agent brief carries the verbatim goal), and after compaction, resume, or a `[[prompt-ledger@…]]` reminder. When `tmp/prompt-ledger/<session>/ledger.md` exists it is the durable record — read it after compaction.
> 4. **Verify before done.** Map the final result to the original goal and every prompt: `P# → done | deferred (reason) | not applicable`. An unaddressed prompt blocks completion.

<!-- SYNC:workflow-registry-binding -->

> **Workflow ⇄ Registry Two-Way Binding** — a workflow is defined in TWO places that MUST agree: the machine registry `.claude/workflows.json` → `workflows.<workflow-id>`, and this skill's `SKILL.md`. Neither is complete alone. Read BOTH before executing, in this order.
>
> **1. Registry → skill (what the registry owns).** Before the first step, read `.claude/workflows.json` → `workflows.<workflow-id>` and treat it as CANONICAL for:
>
> | Registry field | Governs | Rule |
> | --- | --- | --- |
> | `sequence` | the ordered step list | Execute 1:1. NEVER improvise, reorder, add, or drop a step. |
> | `sequence[].applicability` | every conditional step | `when` is the ONLY run condition; on skip, record `skipReason` VERBATIM as the step's evidence. |
> | `sequence[].args` | step flags | Pass exactly as declared. |
> | `parallelGroups` | all-return barriers | Spawn all members in ONE message; advance only after EVERY member returns. |
> | `stepMeta` | inline vs sub-agent, context budget | Overrides the skill's own front matter. |
> | `preActions.injectContext` | mandatory pre-read context | Apply before step 1. |
> | `variants` / `defaultMode` | mode selection | A variant is a COMPLETE sequence; it inherits nothing from the base. |
>
> **2. Skill → registry (what this SKILL.md owns).** The registry declares WHICH steps run in WHAT order; this SKILL.md declares HOW each step executes — protocols, gates, loops, evidence bars, escalation. Each `sequence[].skill` resolves to `.claude/skills/<skill>/SKILL.md`; the workflow's `preActions.readFiles` names this file as the reverse pointer. Read a step's own SKILL.md before running it.
>
> **3. Precedence on conflict.** Registry WINS on step identity, order, args, applicability, barriers and execution mode. SKILL.md WINS on how to perform a step and on the quality bar it must clear. A genuine contradiction between the two — a step in one and not the other, a different order, or an applicability note whose meaning differs — is DRIFT: note the mismatch in your evidence, continue under the precedence above, and report it when the run ends. NEVER silently pick a side, and NEVER edit one side to match without saying so.
>
> **4. Keep both sides equal when editing either.** Changing a sequence, an occurrence ID, or an `applicability` note in `workflows.json` REQUIRES the matching update in this SKILL.md, and vice versa. Specifically: the `**IMPORTANT MANDATORY Steps:**` line MUST remain a clean `->` chain equal to the registry `sequence` (it is parsed, not prose — annotations there break the gate), any conditional step's note here MUST carry the registry's `skipReason` verbatim, and the step-task table's `Conditional?` column MUST match the presence of `applicability`. After editing either side, re-mirror with `$sync-codex` (`node .claude/skills/sync-codex/scripts/run-codex-sync.mjs`).

<!-- SYNC:project-protocol-overlay -->

> **Project Protocol Overlay** — Before executing this skill, resolve project overlays from the index at `<docsRoots.projectReference.path>/skill-protocols-reference.md` (default `docs/project-reference/`; `docsRoots.projectReference.path` in `docs/project-config.json` overrides it). A matching `referenceDocs[]` filename may relocate the index within that root; this registry is independent from task-specific reference-doc selection, so omitted or empty `referenceDocs` does not disable it. The index's `**Protocols directory:**` header selects a project-root-relative body directory (default `docs/project-protocols/`). Match this skill against the `Target` column and take the most specific tier ONLY — exact name > glob > `*`. **That precedence orders overlays against EACH OTHER, never against this skill.** Read only matched bodies derived as `<protocols-dir>/<Name>.md`; the row's Body link is display text, never a read path. Reject unsafe paths without reading. A matched body that is missing or malformed is REPORTED and skipped — never reconstructed from the index Description. An absent index or no match -> proceed with no overlay, silently. Full contract: `.claude/skills/project-skill-protocol/references/registry.md`.
>
> Overlays are **ADDITIVE ONLY**: they ADD rules on top of this skill's own protocol and NEVER replace, override, disable, or reinterpret a rule it already states — removing every overlay must return this skill to exactly its documented behavior. An overlay is a BRIEF, not an authority escalation: it can NEVER waive a workflow gate, git discipline, a review gate, or a user-confirmation gate. A genuine overlay-vs-skill conflict, or two equally-specific overlays that directly contradict -> surface both to the user; NEVER resolve silently.

**MUST ATTENTION** resolve this skill's overlays from the index at `<docsRoots.projectReference.path>/skill-protocols-reference.md` (default `docs/project-reference/`); an empty task `referenceDocs` does NOT disable this lookup.

Missing/malformed body → report and skip; no index or no match → proceed silently.

<!-- SYNC:scale-ready-foundation:reminder -->

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** `scale-ready-foundation`: classify lifecycle/scale/criticality from evidence; choose the smallest architecture that fits; preserve brownfield decisions; make only applicable modules, authorization, external boundaries, dependencies, execution modes, CI/operations, and UI contracts explicit. Verify each supported run/test mode; dual host/container or other modes are needed only when the project supports or requires them. Greenfield warranted omissions block handoff; brownfield gaps get an owner/trigger/next step or an evidence-backed `NOT-APPLICABLE`/`BLOCKED` disposition. Do not require Docker, a database, UI, or distributed services where the project has no such capability.

<!-- /SYNC:scale-ready-foundation:reminder -->

<!-- SYNC:ai-agent-as-user-access:reminder -->

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** Greenfield strongly recommends treating AI agents as first-class non-human actors from inception; choose evidence-backed API/CLI/MCP/WebMCP/event/SDK surfaces over one application capability core with authorization, consent, schemas, idempotency, audit, contract tests in the project's native format (GWT is one option), and observability. Big feature and architecture review are optional/advisory: inspect evidence, adapt, defer as an owned opportunity, record `NOT-APPLICABLE`, or block safety gaps; never build every surface or assume agent = administrator.

## Closing Reminders

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION Goal:** Complete the reviewed large-feature workflow with a bounded, independently releasable actor-facing outcome, embedded decomposition when triggered, scenario evidence, reviewed foundation, full-flow UI proof when applicable, implementation proof, and synchronized handoff; ordinary runs never create the product-roadmap artifact (default `docs/product-roadmap.md`; `docsRoots.productRoadmap.path` in `docs/project-config.json` overrides).
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION Main steps:** classify/decompose → research → domain/architecture/scenario → plan/review → PBI/story/mock-up/spec gates → scaffold/review/reference refresh → implementation/integration verification → final review → required near-end `workflow-e2e` verification → security/test/docs/handoff.

> **[REQUIRED NEAR-END E2E HANDOFF]** After `$workflow-review-changes` (which owns `$security-review`), invoke `$workflow-e2e --source=context`. Its nested workflow owns configured E2E execution and any visual review/evidence required by the request or project contract; preserve a project-required visual gate, and record evidence-backed `N/A` or `ENVIRONMENT-BLOCKED` when the applicable capability is absent. This occurrence remains required even when the nested workflow reports that outcome.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** every generated PBI MUST pass `.claude/skills/shared/releasable-pbi-contract.md`; technical/foundation/setup work is enabling work under a releasable PBI, and UI PBIs require all pages/views, navigation, components, states, and a connected mock-app demo.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** apply `SYNC:scale-ready-foundation` before PLAN₁: inspect existing setup, choose only warranted architecture, model applicable actors/permissions and real infrastructure boundaries, verify material dependency/license/cost constraints, plan supported execution modes and CI/operations, and create the UI design/component contract when UI exists; brownfield refactor gaps become owned opportunities or explicit blockers.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** optional AI-agent advice: when evidence or an accepted future contract makes an agent a potential user, apply `SYNC:ai-agent-as-user-access`; reuse one capability core, choose warranted machine surfaces, and record adaptation, deferral, N/A, or blockers with owner/trigger/next step. Never assume agent = administrator or build every surface.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** test clarity: every assertion-bearing test follows the project's configured/native format and names the guarded behavior or technical contract; use GWT when selected or already idiomatic, otherwise preserve the established test structure and assert an owned outcome. Broad brownfield conversion is an owned opportunity, not silent scope expansion.

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION Protocols in force (concise digest of the SYNC/shared blocks this skill carries):**

- **AI Mistake Prevention:** verify generated content against evidence, trace downstream references, verify all affected outputs, re-read after context loss, surface ambiguity.
- **Nested Task Creation:** Expand child phases, link parent when nested, one `in_progress`.
- **Critical Thinking:** Traced `file:line` proof per claim, confidence >80% to act.
- **Incremental Persistence:** Append findings to `tmp/reports/` per file, never hold in memory.
- **Subagent Return Contract:** Return summary only (≤10 bullets), full detail to disk report.

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** break work into small todo tasks using task tracking BEFORE starting
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** search codebase for 3+ similar patterns before creating new code
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** cite `file:line` evidence for every claim (confidence >80% to act)
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** add a final review todo task to verify work quality

**[TASK-PLANNING]** Before acting, analyze task scope and systematically break it into small todo tasks and sub-tasks using task tracking.

> **[IMPORTANT]** Analyze how big the task is and break it into many small todo tasks systematically before starting — this is very important.

## [LESSON-LEARNED-REMINDER] [BLOCKING] Task Planning & Continuous Improvement — MANDATORY. Do not skip.

Break work into small tasks (task tracking) before starting. Add final task: "Analyze AI mistakes & lessons learned".

**Extract lessons — ROOT CAUSE ONLY, not symptom fixes:**
1. Name the FAILURE MODE (reasoning/assumption failure), not symptom — "assumed API existed without reading source" not "used wrong enum value".
2. Generality test: does this failure mode apply to ≥3 contexts/codebases? If not, abstract one level up.
3. Write as a universal rule — strip project-specific names/paths/classes. Useful on any codebase.
4. Consolidate: multiple mistakes sharing one failure mode → ONE lesson.
5. **Recurrence gate:** "Would this recur in future session WITHOUT this reminder?" — No → skip `$learn`.
6. **Auto-fix gate:** "Could `$code-review`/`$code-simplifier`/`$security-review`/a linter catch this?" — Yes → improve review skill instead.
7. BOTH gates pass → ask user to run `$learn`.
**[CRITICAL-THINKING-MINDSET]** Apply critical thinking, sequential thinking. Every claim needs traced proof, confidence >80% to act.
**Anti-hallucination principle:** Never present guess as fact — cite sources for every claim, admit uncertainty freely, self-check output for errors, cross-reference independently, stay skeptical of own confidence — certainty without evidence root of all hallucination.
**AI Attention principle (Primacy-Recency):** Put the 3 most critical rules at both top and bottom of long prompts/protocols so instruction adherence survives long context windows.
**Goal-driven execution:** Define success criteria first, loop until verified, and stop only when observable checks pass.
**Tests verify intent:** Tests must protect business rules/invariants and fail when the protected intent breaks, not only mirror current behavior.
## Common AI Mistake Prevention (System Lessons)

- **Resolve project applicability before using framework examples.** Read the project config and relevant references, then inspect local evidence; honor explicit N/A and never impose a language, framework, architecture layer, styling method, tool, or runtime surface the project does not use.
- **ROOT-CAUSE GATE — INVESTIGATE FIRST.** Before applying any project-related correction, always use the project's root-cause investigation protocol and establish the cause; the failure site may be only a symptom.
- **FAILED-TEST GATE.** For any failed or unstable test, use the project's test-investigation protocol before editing source or tests; never change either side merely to force green.
- **Re-read files after context compaction.** Edit requires prior Read in same context; compaction wipes read state. Re-read before editing.
- **Grep for old terms after bulk replacements.** AI over-trusts find/replace completeness. Grep full repo after bulk edits for missed refs in docs/configs/catalogs.
- **Check downstream references before deleting.** Deletions cascade doc/code staleness. Map referencing files before removal.
- **After memory loss, check existing state before creating new.** Compaction wipes prior-work memory. Query current state to resume — never blindly duplicate.
- **Verify AI-generated content against actual code.** AI hallucinates APIs, class names, method signatures. Grep to confirm existence before documenting/referencing.
- **Trace full dependency chain after edits.** Changing a definition misses downstream consumers. Trace the full chain.
- **When renaming, grep ALL consumer file types.** Some file types silently ignore missing refs (no compile error). Search code, templates, configs, generated files.
- **Trace ALL code paths when verifying correctness.** Code existing ≠ code executing. Trace early exits, error branches, conditional skips — not just happy path.
- **Update docs that embed canonical data when source changes.** Docs inlining derived data (workflows, schemas, configs) go stale silently. Update all embedding docs alongside source.
- **Verify sub-agent results after context recovery.** Background agents may finish while parent compacted — grep-verify output, don't trust assumed completion.
- **Cross-check full target list against sub-agent assignments.** Parallel sub-agents by category miss boundary items. Reconcile union of assignments against target list before proceeding.
- **Sub-agents inherit knowledge only from their agent .md definition — use custom agent types, not built-in Explore.** Tool adoption = permission + knowledge + enforcement (numbered workflow step).
- **Persist sub-agent findings incrementally, not as a final batch.** Long sub-agents hit cutoffs before final write — findings lost. Instruct append-per-section to report file.
- **Ownership before action.** When investigating a failure, ask which part owns the behavior before changing anything. Trace the wrong state to the component responsible for its invariant, then make one authoritative correction there.
- **Test failure → record a provisional verdict before trace/edit, then investigate.** Use the full five-way taxonomy: SOURCE-WRONG (production violates intent), TEST-WRONG (assertion/setup is stale), TEST-NOT-OPTIMAL (valid but fragile or low-signal test), ENVIRONMENT-BLOCKED (external state prevents a verdict), or AMBIGUOUS (intent/evidence cannot choose safely). Then trace root cause and triangulate against the governing spec if one exists (the business spec root — default `docs/specs`; a `specRoots.business.path` entry in `docs/project-config.json` overrides the path) AND source. NEVER weaken an assertion, add a skip, relax a timeout, or change source merely to force green.
- **Grep ALL removed names after extraction/refactoring.** Primary file "done" ≠ secondary files clean. Grep entire scope for every removed symbol before declaring complete.
- **Assume existing values are intentional — ask WHY before changing OR flagging one as a defect.** Pattern-matching as "wrong" skips context. Before changing or reporting any constant/limit/flag/cutoff: read comments, git blame, the CALLER's ordering (the guarantee that makes the value correct usually lives in code running immediately BEFORE the cited line), and 2+ sibling call sites of the same convention. A doc stating WHAT without WHY is missing rationale, not proof of a missing guard — and in a validation pass, an accurate `file:line` citation proves the transcription, never the defect.
- **Verify ALL affected outputs, not just the first.** One build green ≠ all green. Multi-stack changes (backend/frontend/tests/docs) require verifying EVERY output.
- **Evaluate fit before copying a nearby pattern.** Closest example ≠ matching preconditions — verify the new context shares the same constraints, base classes, scope, lifetime.
- **Holistic analysis — resist the nearest-attention trap.** Do not dive into the first plausible cause. List every precondition (configuration, environment, inputs, dependencies, versions, permissions, and state). Verify each against evidence, not intuition. Ask "what would falsify this?" — if nothing, it is not a hypothesis. The most expensive failure is going deeper into an assumed area while the real issue sits in an unexamined condition.
- **Minimal changes — apply the relevance test.** Every change must trace to the reported problem; avoid unrelated cleanup. For review or enhancement work, announce improvements beyond the main request rather than silently expanding scope. Ask: "Would this change exist if I were not addressing this request?" — if not, remove it or disclose it.
- **Surface ambiguity before coding — don't pick silently.** Multiple valid interpretations → present each with effort: "[Request] could mean (1) [N h], (2) [N h]. Which matters?" List scope/format/volume/constraints assumptions first. If simpler path exists, say so. Never silently pick.
- **Why-Review adversarial mindset — apply when reviewing any plan, decision, or design.** Default SKEPTIC not VALIDATOR: steel-man a rejected alternative, invert each stated reason ("what does it sacrifice?"), stress-test top 2-3 assumptions, run pre-mortem ("ships, fails in 3 months — what breaks?"), surface 1-2 alternatives author missed. Section presence ≠ quality; quality = causal reasoning + concrete mitigations + evidence, not "it's better" or "monitor closely".
- **Front-load report-write in sub-agent prompts for large reviews.** Many-file sub-agents hit budget before final write — findings lost. Design prompts so: (1) report-write is first explicit deliverable, (2) append per-file/section (not batched), (3) scope bounded so reads don't exhaust budget. Truncated mid-sentence with no report file → spawn narrower scope, don't retry same prompt.
- **After context compaction, re-verify all prior phase outcomes before continuing.** Summaries describe intent, not environment state (git index, filesystem, processes). On resume, FIRST audit: git status, re-read modified files, verify filesystem. Every "completed" claim is an untested hypothesis until evidence confirms.
- **OOM/memory: check row count before row size.** Triage: (1) Unbounded query — no DB filter for trigger? Push filter to DB; eliminates OOM. (2) Large rows? Projection reduces proportionally. Row reduction > projection in ROI.
- **Assert the outcome your system OWNS, never the intermediate state your INFRASTRUCTURE owns.** When testing anything asynchronous (queue/broker delivery, retries, background jobs, caches, replication), assert the final business/entity state. NEVER assert the delivery bookkeeping — consume/send status, attempt counts, last-error, row existence or counts in a broker, scheduler, or outbox/inbox table. That bookkeeping lives in shared infrastructure that ANY co-running process (a peer worker, a second replica, a leftover local container) can write, usually under a deterministic shared key, so the assertion silently tests the developer's environment instead of the system: green when run alone, flaky the instant anything else shares that broker + database. Gate question for every assertion: "would this hold no matter WHICH process did the work?" — if no, assert the converged data state instead. Corollary: process-local fault injection and in-process telemetry cannot gate work any process may perform — use them as stress amplifiers (arm → bounded window → disarm → assert convergence), never as preconditions.
- **Store disposable generated output in the project workspace.** If an output can be regenerated and is not source code, a canonical source-of-truth, or an intentionally versioned projection, write it under the project-root `tmp/` or `temp/` directory (prefer `tmp/`), scoped to the run. This includes temporary state, integration/E2E results, reports, logs, screenshots, traces, videos, coverage, dumps, and candidate evidence. Never put these outputs in source, docs, the plans root (default `plans/`; a `docsRoots.plans.path` entry in `docs/project-config.json` overrides the path), the team-artifacts root (default `team-artifacts/`; `docsRoots.teamArtifacts.path` in the same config overrides the path), or mirror directories; the project-root `.gitignore` must ignore `/tmp/` and `/temp/` by default. Committed fixtures, accepted baselines, canonical specs/docs, and explicitly versioned generated mirrors remain at their declared owner paths.
- **Judge the environment before judging the code — a competing hypothesis, not a fallback.** A bug, failed test, error, or odd output is NOT proof of a code defect. Before deep tracing and before any verdict, sweep environment preconditions (toolchain/dependency/lockfile state, stale build or cache artifacts, env vars and config profile, service dependencies up-migrated-seeded, ports/network/clock, OS-path/locale, permissions and locks, leftover processes/containers/test data) AND transient resource pressure (RAM/OOM, CPU saturation under parallel workers, disk/temp exhaustion, handle and connection-pool limits, network flakiness, a timeout that is really slowness). Tell-tale shape: non-deterministic, timing-dependent, passes alone but fails in parallel, fails only on one machine or only on CI, or an error naming resources rather than business rules. Cite the discriminator you ran (clean environment? did code on the failing path change since it last passed? one machine or all? concurrency 1 or a clean rebuild?) — a verdict without one is a guess, for code as much as for the environment. Fix an environment cause in the environment or setup; NEVER edit product code or weaken/skip a test to absorb it, and a failure that vanishes on retry stays unexplained until its mechanism is named. — why: forcing green against an environment fault hides the real defect and permanently rots the test.
- **Cross-platform execution is a required contract.** Before authoring or changing a tool, script, process launcher, path assertion, or filesystem test, name the supported Windows, macOS, and Linux behaviors. Use platform-neutral Node APIs and literal argv vectors; never infer shell, temporary-path, executable-extension, ACL, or symlink semantics from the current host. Canonicalize existing paths before identity, hashing, or equality checks; test native Windows and POSIX seams when behavior differs; keep CI platform matrices authoritative. Preserve fail-closed security boundaries — repair the fixture or platform branch, never weaken the guard just to make one OS green.
- **Keep domain concepts out of generic/shared/infrastructure layers.** Reusable layer (shared library, framework, infra module) must reference NO consumer-specific domain concept — tenant/customer/product IDs, business entities, feature rules. Leak compiles + runs → passes review silently while coupling the "reusable" layer to one consumer. Keep shared type domain-free; push domain fields/logic down into the consumer via subclass/composition. — why: a layer coupled to one consumer's domain is no longer reusable.
