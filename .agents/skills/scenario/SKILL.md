## Codex Project-Reference Loading (Hook-Independent)

Claude and Codex use static project-reference loading as the authority; hooks may accelerate discovery but never replace the explicit read.
When coding, planning, debugging, testing, or reviewing, open project docs explicitly using this routing.

**Always read:**
- `docs/project-config.json` (project-specific paths, commands, modules, and workflow/test settings)
- `docs/project-reference/docs-index-reference.md` (routes to the full `docs/project-reference/*` catalog)
- `docs/project-reference/lessons.md` (always-on guardrails and anti-patterns)

**Missing/stale context route:** If `docs/project-config.json`, the docs index, `lessons.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, or any task-required reference doc is missing or stale, auto-run `$project-init` or the narrow setup route (`$project-config`, `$docs-init`, `$scan-all`, `$scan --target=<key>`, `$ai-context-refresh`) before ordinary project-specific work. A full `$sync-codex` run preflights `CLAUDE.md`; a completed `$ai-context-refresh` run may invoke the standalone runner with `--skip=claude-md` after final source edits. Markerless roots need AI smart-merge unless `portability.requireUniversalGuides: false` is explicit.

**Situation-based docs** (pick by the phase you are about to enter — plan/investigate, edit, test, spec/doc, review — and read only docs the project selects in `referenceDocs` that exist):
- Planning, investigation, or design: `project-structure-reference.md`, `domain-entities-reference.md`, plus the docs below for every file type the plan touches
- Editing or writing code: `code-review-rules.md` plus the backend or frontend docs below for the file type
- Project structure/architecture/tech-stack/deployment/setup (any layer — backend, frontend, or infra): `project-structure-reference.md`
- Backend/CQRS/API/domain/entity changes: `backend-patterns-reference.md`, `domain-entities-reference.md`
- Frontend/UI/styling/design-system: `frontend-patterns-reference.md`, `scss-styling-guide.md` (or the configured styling reference), `design-system/README.md`
- Spec authoring, `docs/specs/` pathing, or TC format: `feature-spec-reference.md`, `spec-system-reference.md`, `spec-principles.md`
- Behavior/public-contract changes or spec-test-code sync: `workflow-spec-test-code-cycle-reference.md` plus the spec docs above
- Derived spec indexes/ERDs/reimplementation guides: `spec-system-reference.md` and source Feature Specs under `docs/specs/`
- Integration test implementation/review: `integration-test-reference.md`
- E2E test implementation/review: `e2e-test-reference.md`
- Test-data seeders: `seed-test-data-reference.md`
- Code review/audit work: `code-review-rules.md` plus the docs above for every file type under review
- Per-file conventions (`contextGroups[]`): before editing an unfamiliar path class, run `node .claude/hooks/lib/file-conventions.cjs --lookup <path>`

**Dedup:** a doc counts as loaded only when your own read returned its full content to this context after the last compaction and within roughly the last 200K tokens, and it has not changed since — cite it `(loaded)` instead of re-reading. A hook reminder, a summary, or a prior mention never counts; a delegated sub-agent starts empty, so name the resolved doc paths in its brief.

Never read all docs blindly: route from `docs-index-reference.md` and open only what the task needs.

## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Turn one selected embedded outcome slice, explicit roadmap milestone, framework/library scope, or explicitly accepted isolated change into an adversarial, observable scenario set that exposes data corruption, misleading states, access leaks, and recovery gaps before an implementation plan can be approved.

**Summary:**

- Resolve the owning decomposition block, explicit roadmap milestone, framework technical scope, or EXEMPT scope and stable plan directory; block when the applicable upstream scope is missing or unapproved. The embedded branch does not require a product roadmap.
- Derive scenarios from the user journey and source-of-truth state, then stress refresh/replay, invalid input, concurrency, deletion, lifecycle, access, partial failure, and evidence hygiene.
- Map every high-impact scenario to an invariant, expected outcome, prevention/detection expectation, and TC/evidence; ask the owner about material choices.
- Write `{plan-id}/scenario-analysis.md` under the plans root (default `plans/`; a `docsRoots.plans.path` entry in `docs/project-config.json` overrides the path) and mark the Scenario Gate PASS or BLOCKED; `$plan` cannot cook from a blocked gate, and an EXEMPT plan still needs this artifact.
- **Main steps:** resolve inputs/branch → reconstruct the selected journey and source of truth → generate adversarial scenarios → resolve owner decisions → write the analysis → run the Scenario Gate → hand off to `$plan` or record a conditional skip.

**Workflow:** 0) resolve inputs → 1) reconstruct scope → 2) generate adversarial scenarios → 3) resolve decisions → 4) write artifact → 5) run Scenario Gate → 6) hand off to `$plan`.

**Key Rules:**

- Scenarios describe situations and expected outcomes, not framework or database solutions.
- A happy path alone is never sufficient for persistent/stateful work.
- High-impact scenarios without evidence or an owner decision block the plan.
- Never put secrets, real payment data, tokens, or personal data in scenario/evidence artifacts.

## Mission

<request>$ARGUMENTS</request>

## Required Context

**MUST ATTENTION READ** `.claude/skills/shared/product-roadmap-contract.md` and `references/scenario-template.md` before analysis. Also read `docs/project-config.json`, `docs/project-reference/docs-index-reference.md`, and `docs/project-reference/lessons.md` when present. Use the active plan context to resolve the output directory.

## Phase 0: Resolve Inputs

Find the active owning artifact/scope brief from `$ARGUMENTS`, `## Plan Context`, or the explicit milestone in the product-roadmap artifact (default `docs/product-roadmap.md`; `docsRoots.productRoadmap.path` in `docs/project-config.json` overrides). Classify applicability first, then confirm:

- for embedded large-idea work, the parent PBI/spec has a complete `large_idea_decomposition` block, exactly one stable slice is selected, and its `outcome_slices`, dependencies, non-goals, risks/evidence, and deferred owners are readable;
- for explicit-roadmap work, the roadmap exists and is approved and exactly one milestone is selected;
- for a framework/library change, the technical scope brief names affected carriers, operational risks, evidence owners, and commands;
- for an isolated change, the scope brief contains the shared contract's explicit `Roadmap Applicability: EXEMPT` block with reason and accepting owner, and no roadmap or milestone is fabricated;
- the owning artifact/scope brief states actor or technical owner, outcome, in-scope behavior, non-goals, terms, source of truth, and evidence;
- scenario output has a concrete plan directory. Derive `plan-id` from the owning scope's parent directory; if a required scope artifact is not under `{plan-id}/` in the plans root (default `plans/`; `docsRoots.plans.path` in `docs/project-config.json` overrides), stop `BLOCKED` and route to the explicit roadmap writer only for the explicit roadmap branch, or to the owning decomposition/framework/EXEMPT scope step otherwise.

If any applicable input is missing, stop `BLOCKED` and route to its owning branch. Do not infer a slice, milestone, technical outcome, or boundary from a screen, PBI title, or plan filename. If an embedded scope has no replay/state/ownership/recovery/evidence risk that needs adversarial analysis, record the conditional skip reason and do not create a standalone roadmap or scenario artifact.

## Phase 1: Reconstruct the User Journey

Write the selected slice/milestone/technical outcome as an observable sequence:

`actor intent → input/action → business state change → user-visible outcome → persisted/reopened truth → later action`

Name states, transitions, ownership boundaries, and non-goals. Highlight terms that could be interpreted more than one way. Use existing Feature Specs, PBIs, or code only as evidence for an existing product; the scope brief remains the product boundary.

## Phase 2: Generate Adversarial Scenarios

Derive situations from the actual journey, not a canned count. Cover applicable dimensions:

| Dimension | Questions to ask |
| --- | --- |
| Persistence / replay | What happens after refresh, reopen, retry, duplicate submit, or redeploy? |
| Validation / corruption | Can invalid input replace valid data or create a misleading partial record? |
| Concurrency | What if two tabs/actors edit or submit the same item at once? |
| Lifecycle / state | Can a state be skipped, reversed, or confused with a later state such as published/delivered? |
| Ownership / access | Can an unauthenticated, non-owner, or other store/tenant read or mutate it? |
| Deletion / relationships | Does deletion leave orphaned variants, assets, references, or history? |
| Partial failure / recovery | What if a dependent action succeeds halfway, times out, or is repeated? |
| Evidence / operations | Can completion evidence hide failure or expose secrets/sensitive data? |

For each scenario assign `SCN-{MILESTONE}-{NNN}`, severity (`Critical`, `High`, `Medium`, `Low`), trigger, precondition, expected business outcome/invariant, bad outcome, prevention/detection expectation, owner, and TC/evidence mapping. Use one concrete digital-catalog example only when it clarifies a non-obvious pattern; do not force irrelevant dimensions.

## Phase 3: Decision and Risk Gate

Use ask the user directly for each material choice the scenario analysis cannot resolve, such as conflict policy, deletion semantics, status meaning, audit/history expectations, access boundary, or acceptable recovery behavior. Present 2–4 concrete options and a recommendation. Record each decision as `confirmed`, `deferred`, or `blocked`.

A scenario may be deferred only when the owning decomposition block or explicit roadmap names the deferred item and its owner/follow-up artifact. “AI will handle it later” is not a decision.

## Phase 4: Write the Scenario Artifact

Write `{plan-id}/scenario-analysis.md` under the plans root (default `plans/`; `docsRoots.plans.path` in `docs/project-config.json` overrides) incrementally using `references/scenario-template.md`, beside the resolved scope handoff when the selected branch requires a scenario artifact. Cite the owning decomposition/spec/PBI, explicit roadmap/scope brief, or framework technical brief and any existing spec/code evidence. Keep implementation choices out; record the expected behavior or operational proof that the future plan must protect.

## Phase 5: Scenario Gate

Mark the artifact `PASS` only when:

1. every high-impact scenario has a single expected business outcome or invariant;
2. every high-impact scenario maps to a planned TC, evidence item, or an explicitly approved non-goal/deferred owner;
3. all material choices have an owner status and no unresolved `blocked` decision is hidden;
4. evidence is observable, repeatable, and redacted.

Otherwise mark `BLOCKED`, name the missing decision/evidence, and stop before `$plan`.

## Phase 6: Handoff

Pass the scenario artifact path and scenario IDs to `$plan`. The implementation plan must map phases to the selected slice, explicit milestone, framework boundary, or EXEMPT scope, plus non-goals, scenario IDs, TC IDs, commands, and evidence. `$plan-review` checks the chain and `$plan-validate` asks the owner to confirm remaining material choices.

## Output

Report:

- applicability branch, owning artifact/slice or explicit roadmap/milestone, and scope handoff path when applicable;
- scenario count by severity and covered dimensions;
- high-impact scenario IDs and evidence/TC mappings;
- confirmed/deferred/open decisions;
- Scenario Gate status;
- plan handoff or blocker.

- **MANDATORY** Pick docs by the phase you are about to enter — plan/investigate, edit code, tests, specs/docs, review — from the gate's routing table, JUST IN TIME before the first target read/grep/edit/test, plus the file's `contextGroups[]` conventions before editing it; cite `Reference docs read: ...`.
- **MANDATORY** Dedup: skip a re-read only for your own full read after the last compaction, within ~200K tokens, unchanged since — a hook reminder, summary, or prior mention is NEVER evidence; re-read after compaction or resume, and give delegated sub-agents the resolved doc paths. Project config and conventions override generic framework defaults.

## SYNC:ai-sdd-artifact-contract:reminder

- **MANDATORY** Apply `shared/sdd-artifact-contract.md`; keep reusable AI-SDD in `.claude` and local rules in project docs.
- **MANDATORY** Resolve and validate `specArtifacts`: use valid native owner/case/variant identity and assertion-bearing evidence; use strict-default TC/TestSpec only when the profile is absent; block a malformed or unsupported declaration without fallback.
- **MANDATORY** Code-to-spec extraction is reference-only until canonical acceptance; any supported AI tool may execute with synced context.
- **MANDATORY** Update `.claude` source before syncing generated mirrors; do not manually edit `.agents`, `.codex`, or `AGENTS.md`.
- **MANDATORY** Missing or stale project config, root instruction files, or required reference docs route project-specific work through `$project-init` or the narrow setup route automatically.
**[TASK-PLANNING] [MANDATORY]** BEFORE executing any workflow or skill step, create/update task tracking for all planned steps, analyze the task graph (output dependencies, shared write targets) into ordered parallel waves per PARALLELIZE before starting any task, then keep it synchronized as each step starts/completes. Preserve fixed ordering when a skill or workflow explicitly fixes it.
- **MANDATORY** Pin `Original goal:` before the first action and keep `User prompts this session: P1…Pn` current; re-read both at every step, before delegation, and after compaction.
- **MANDATORY** Before claiming done, map the result to the original goal and every prompt (`P# → done | deferred | n/a`); never store secrets in them.
## [LESSON-LEARNED-REMINDER] [BLOCKING] Task Planning & Continuous Improvement — MANDATORY. Do not skip.

Break work into small tasks (task tracking) before starting. Add final task: "Analyze AI mistakes & lessons learned".

**Extract lessons — ROOT CAUSE ONLY, not symptom fixes:**
1. Name the FAILURE MODE (reasoning/assumption failure), not symptom — "assumed API existed without reading source" not "used wrong enum value".
2. Generality test: does this failure mode apply to ≥3 contexts/codebases? If not, abstract one level up.
3. Write as a universal rule — strip project-specific names/paths/classes. Useful on any codebase.
4. Consolidate: multiple mistakes sharing one failure mode → ONE lesson.
5. **Recurrence gate:** "Would this recur in future session WITHOUT this reminder?" — No → skip `$learn`.
6. **Auto-fix gate:** "Could `$code-review`/`$code-simplifier`/`$security-review`/a linter catch this?" — Yes → improve review skill instead.
7. BOTH gates pass → ask user to run `$learn`.
**[CRITICAL-THINKING-MINDSET]** Apply critical thinking, sequential thinking. Every claim needs traced proof, confidence >80% to act.
**Anti-hallucination principle:** Never present guess as fact — cite sources for every claim, admit uncertainty freely, self-check output for errors, cross-reference independently, stay skeptical of own confidence — certainty without evidence root of all hallucination.
**AI Attention principle (Primacy-Recency):** Put the 3 most critical rules at both top and bottom of long prompts/protocols so instruction adherence survives long context windows.
**Goal-driven execution:** Define success criteria first, loop until verified, and stop only when observable checks pass.
**Tests verify intent:** Tests must protect business rules/invariants and fail when the protected intent breaks, not only mirror current behavior.
**Judgement integrity:** For theory checks, judgements, evaluations and gap hunts, the prompt's premise is a hypothesis — test it AND its opposite with one evidence bar (web-verify external facts), why-review the draft as an inline self-check (run the `why-review` skill only for a formal review/audit/gap-hunt deliverable or a MEDIUM+/consequential issue the inline pass cannot settle), never invent findings or manufacture disagreement ("no material issues" is a valid verdict); end with a `Bias check:` line (`SYNC:judgement-integrity`).
## Common AI Mistake Prevention (System Lessons)

- **Resolve project applicability before using framework examples.** Read the project config and relevant references, then inspect local evidence; honor explicit N/A and never impose a language, framework, architecture layer, styling method, tool, or runtime surface the project does not use.
- **ROOT-CAUSE GATE — INVESTIGATE FIRST.** Before applying any project-related correction, always use the project's root-cause investigation protocol and establish the cause; the failure site may be only a symptom.
- **FAILED-TEST GATE.** For any failed or unstable test, use the project's test-investigation protocol before editing source or tests; never change either side merely to force green.
- **Re-read and re-verify after context compaction or resume.** Compaction wipes read state and memory; summaries describe intent, not environment state. Re-read before editing, audit current state (git status, files) before creating anything new, grep-verify sub-agent output — every "completed" claim is a hypothesis until evidence confirms it.
- **Verify AI-generated content against actual code.** AI hallucinates APIs, class names, method signatures. Grep to confirm existence before documenting/referencing.
- **Trace every consumer before and after a change.** Map referencing files before deleting; after bulk replacements, renames, or extractions, grep ALL consumer file types (templates, configs, catalogs and generated files fail silently) for every old or removed name; trace the full dependency chain of an edited definition; update docs that embed canonical data alongside their source.
- **Trace ALL code paths when verifying correctness.** Code existing ≠ code executing. Trace early exits, error branches, conditional skips — not just happy path.
- **Sub-agents: inherit, cover, persist.** Sub-agents know only their agent .md definition — use custom agent types, not built-in Explore. Reconcile the union of assignments against the full target list — category splits miss boundary items. Make the report write the first deliverable, appended per file/section with bounded scope; a truncated run with no report → spawn a narrower scope, never the same prompt.
- **Ownership before action.** When investigating a failure, ask which part owns the behavior before changing anything. Trace the wrong state to the component responsible for its invariant, then make one authoritative correction there.
- **Test failure → record a provisional verdict before trace/edit, then investigate.** Use the full five-way taxonomy: SOURCE-WRONG (production violates intent), TEST-WRONG (assertion/setup is stale), TEST-NOT-OPTIMAL (valid but fragile or low-signal test), ENVIRONMENT-BLOCKED (external state prevents a verdict), or AMBIGUOUS (intent/evidence cannot choose safely). Then trace root cause and triangulate against the governing spec if one exists (the business spec root — default `docs/specs`; a `specRoots.business.path` entry in `docs/project-config.json` overrides the path) AND source. NEVER weaken an assertion, add a skip, relax a timeout, or change source merely to force green.
- **Assume existing values are intentional — ask WHY before changing OR flagging one as a defect.** Before changing or reporting any constant/limit/flag/cutoff, read comments, git blame, the CALLER's ordering (the guarantee usually runs immediately BEFORE the cited line), and 2+ sibling call sites. A doc stating WHAT without WHY is missing rationale, not proof of a missing guard — and an accurate `file:line` citation proves the transcription, never the defect.
- **Verify ALL affected outputs, not just the first.** One build green ≠ all green. Multi-stack changes (backend/frontend/tests/docs) require verifying EVERY output.
- **Evaluate fit before copying a nearby pattern.** Closest example ≠ matching preconditions — verify the new context shares the same constraints, base classes, scope, lifetime.
- **Holistic analysis — resist the nearest-attention trap.** Do not dive into the first plausible cause. List every precondition (configuration, environment, inputs, dependencies, versions, permissions, state) and verify each against evidence. Ask "what would falsify this?" — if nothing, it is not a hypothesis.
- **Minimal changes — apply the relevance test.** Every change must trace to the reported problem: "Would this change exist if I were not addressing this request?" — if not, remove or disclose it; never silently expand scope.
- **Surface ambiguity before coding — don't pick silently.** Multiple valid interpretations → present each with effort ("(1) [N h], (2) [N h]. Which matters?"), list assumptions, name a simpler path when one exists.
- **Why-Review adversarial mindset — apply when reviewing any plan, decision, or design.** Default SKEPTIC: steel-man a rejected alternative, invert each reason ("what does it sacrifice?"), stress-test the top 2-3 assumptions, run a pre-mortem. Quality = causal reasoning + mitigations + evidence, not section presence.
- **OOM/memory: check row count before row size.** An unbounded query (no DB filter for the trigger) → push the filter to the DB; then large rows → projection. Row reduction > projection in ROI.
- **Assert the outcome your system OWNS, never the intermediate state your INFRASTRUCTURE owns.** For async work (queues, retries, background jobs, caches, replication) assert the final business/entity state — NEVER delivery bookkeeping (consume/send status, attempt counts, last-error, broker/scheduler/outbox rows) that ANY co-running process can write: green alone, flaky once anything shares that broker + database. Gate: "would this hold no matter WHICH process did the work?" Process-local fault injection is a stress amplifier (arm → bounded window → disarm → assert convergence), never a precondition.
- **Store disposable generated output in the project workspace.** If an output can be regenerated and is not source code, a canonical source-of-truth, or an intentionally versioned projection, write it under the project-root `tmp/` or `temp/` directory (prefer `tmp/`), scoped to the run. This includes temporary state, integration/E2E results, reports, logs, screenshots, traces, videos, coverage, dumps, and candidate evidence. Never put these outputs in source, docs, the plans root (default `plans/`; a `docsRoots.plans.path` entry in `docs/project-config.json` overrides the path), the team-artifacts root (default `team-artifacts/`; `docsRoots.teamArtifacts.path` in the same config overrides the path), or mirror directories; the project-root `.gitignore` must ignore `/tmp/` and `/temp/` by default. Committed fixtures, accepted baselines, canonical specs/docs, and explicitly versioned generated mirrors remain at their declared owner paths.
- **Judge the environment before judging the code — a competing hypothesis, not a fallback.** A bug, failed test, error, or odd output is NOT proof of a code defect. Before any verdict, sweep environment preconditions (toolchain/lockfile state, stale build/cache artifacts, env vars and config, service dependencies, ports/clock, OS path/locale, permissions, leftover processes/test data) AND transient resource pressure (RAM/OOM, CPU, disk/temp, handle and connection-pool limits, network, a timeout that is really slowness). Tell-tale: non-deterministic, fails only in parallel, on one machine or only on CI, or an error naming resources. Cite the discriminator you ran (clean environment? path changed? concurrency 1?) — a verdict without one is a guess. Fix an environment cause in the environment; NEVER edit product code or weaken/skip a test to absorb it; a failure that vanishes on retry stays unexplained until its mechanism is named.
- **Cross-platform execution is a required contract.** Before authoring or changing a tool, script, process launcher, path assertion, or filesystem test, name the supported Windows, macOS, and Linux behaviors. Use platform-neutral APIs and literal argv vectors; never infer shell, temp-path, executable-extension, ACL, or symlink semantics from the current host. A documented command gives its Windows, macOS, and Linux form (Python: `py -3` on Windows, `python3` on macOS/Linux; shell: PowerShell/`.cmd` beside POSIX `sh`) or one platform-neutral runner such as `node <script>`. Canonicalize existing paths before identity, hashing, or equality checks; test native Windows and POSIX seams when behavior differs; keep CI platform matrices authoritative. Preserve fail-closed security boundaries — repair the fixture or platform branch, never weaken the guard just to make one OS green.
- **Keep domain concepts out of generic/shared/infrastructure layers.** A reusable layer must reference NO consumer-specific domain concept (tenant/customer/product IDs, business entities, feature rules); such a leak compiles, runs, and passes review while coupling the layer to one consumer. Push domain fields/logic down into the consumer via subclass/composition.
