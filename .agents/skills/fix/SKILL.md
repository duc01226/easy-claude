## Codex Project-Reference Loading (Hook-Independent)

Claude and Codex use static project-reference loading as the authority; hooks may accelerate discovery but never replace the explicit read.
When coding, planning, debugging, testing, or reviewing, open project docs explicitly using this routing.

**Always read:**
- `docs/project-config.json` (project-specific paths, commands, modules, and workflow/test settings)
- `docs/project-reference/docs-index-reference.md` (routes to the full `docs/project-reference/*` catalog)
- `docs/project-reference/lessons.md` (always-on guardrails and anti-patterns)

**Missing/stale context route:** If `docs/project-config.json`, the docs index, `lessons.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, or any task-required reference doc is missing or stale, auto-run `$project-init` or the narrow setup route (`$project-config`, `$docs-init`, `$scan-all`, `$scan --target=<key>`, `$ai-context-refresh`) before ordinary project-specific work. A full `$sync-codex` run preflights `CLAUDE.md`; a completed `$ai-context-refresh` run may invoke the standalone runner with `--skip=claude-md` after final source edits. Markerless roots need AI smart-merge unless `portability.requireUniversalGuides: false` is explicit.

**Situation-based docs:**
- Project structure/architecture/tech-stack/deployment/setup (any layer — backend, frontend, or infra): `project-structure-reference.md`
- Backend/CQRS/API/domain/entity changes: `backend-patterns-reference.md`, `domain-entities-reference.md`
- Frontend/UI/styling/design-system: `frontend-patterns-reference.md`, `configured styling reference`, `design-system/README.md`
- Spec authoring, `docs/specs/` pathing, or TC format: `feature-spec-reference.md`, `spec-system-reference.md`, `spec-principles.md`
- Behavior/public-contract changes or spec-test-code sync: `workflow-spec-test-code-cycle-reference.md` plus the spec docs above
- Derived spec indexes/ERDs/reimplementation guides: `spec-system-reference.md` and source Feature Specs under `docs/specs/`
- Integration test implementation/review: `integration-test-reference.md`
- E2E test implementation/review: `e2e-test-reference.md`
- Code review/audit work: `code-review-rules.md` plus domain docs above based on changed files

Do not read all docs blindly. Start from `docs-index-reference.md`, then open only relevant files for the task.

## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Eliminate each issue's root cause with end-to-start `file:line` evidence, fix the lowest invariant-owning layer (never the crash site), and add or update regression coverage that proves the fix converges.

**Summary:**

- **Purpose:** Diagnose end-to-start, fix the lowest invariant-owning layer, update regression coverage and spec/tests; NEVER patch symptoms.
- **No-flag spine:** Root-Cause Prerequisite Gate → researcher investigation → `debug-investigate` trace (`file:line`, hypothesis matrix, forward proof) → Confidence & Evidence → impact plan → 🛑 Validate-Before-Fix → owning-layer implementation → standalone test update (`$integration-test`, or justified `$test` fallback) → conditional `$spec` check → `$changes-review` for production code → `$why-review`; ALWAYS follow this order.
- **Routing:** `--target={ci|issue|logs|test|types|ui}` selects a self-contained inline branch with its own diagnosis; no flag runs the spine. Branches skip standalone §1/§2 duplication, but every direct call passes the Root-Cause Prerequisite Gate.
- **Modes/gates:** HARD is default; fast mode requires ALL 5 trivial-bug conditions. Root-cause proof, `Confidence: X%` (`<60%` STOP), and Validate-Before-Fix are hard gates; approval may skip only inside a workflow, while standalone calls own test/spec/review phases; NEVER bypass a gate.

**Workflow:**

1. **Investigation** — Use researcher subagents to explore the issue in parallel; use `$investigate` inline for graph-backed tracing.
2. **Diagnose** — Trace root cause through code paths with evidence
3. **Plan** — Create fix plan with impact analysis
4. **Fix** — Implement and verify the fix
5. **Standalone test update** — After the fix, every standalone call invokes `$integration-test` to add or update regression coverage; use `$test` only for a justified unit-test seam. Inside a workflow, the parent sequence owns these test phases.

**Key Rules:**

- **Root-Cause Prerequisite Gate (BLOCKING):** no code edit until `$debug-investigate` traced THIS problem in THIS session — evidence, not recall
- Debug Mindset: every claim needs `file:line` evidence
- Use subagents for parallel investigation of multiple hypotheses
- Always create a plan before implementing complex fixes
- **Target flag** (see [Target Routing](#target-routing---target)): `--target={ci|issue|logs|test|types|ui}` selects a self-contained inline branch that scopes the fix to that domain. No flag = full diagnose→fix spine below.

## Default Mode Policy

> **Default mode HARD.** Every section below applies: parallel researcher subagents, `file:line` root-cause tracing, Confidence & Evidence Gate, impact plan, and bug-preservation tests.
>
> **Fast mode ONLY when ALL 5 conditions hold** (genuinely trivial bug):
>
> - Root cause obvious from error and already located; no diagnosis needed
> - One file; ≤10 changed lines
> - No cross-service impact or contract change
> - Existing bug test, or non-functional typo/log-message fix
> - Fix confidence ≥95% without further investigation
>
> Any condition fails → full protocol; in doubt use HARD. Non-trivial fixes cannot skip diagnosis.
>
> **Fast mode skips only:** parallel subagent investigation (direct read/grep instead), separate plan (inline change), and regression-test authoring (only when coverage exists). It still runs Confidence & Evidence, Behavioral Delta Matrix, and the existing test suite.

## 🛑 Root-Cause Prerequisite Gate (Direct `$fix` Invocation) — BLOCKING

> **[BLOCKING]** Direct `$fix` MUST NOT edit code until `$debug-investigate` produces THIS problem's root cause in THIS session. The gate runs before the Standalone Mode Minimum Contract, any `--target=` branch, and 🛑 Validate-Before-Fix. — why: an untraced first edit patches the symptom site and ships the disease.
>
> **1. Trigger — ALL direct invocations.** User-typed command or model-selected skill; every `--target={ci|issue|logs|test|types|ui}` branch and no-flag spine. Branches skip contract §1/§2 duplication but pass this gate. — why: a branch `debugger`/`tester` step is not an end-to-start trace.
>
> **2. Check — evidence, never memory.** Before the first code edit, accept only same-session, same-problem `$debug-investigate` evidence:
>
> - a the current task list row for `debug-investigate` (or its phase tasks) covering this symptom, **or**
> - a written investigation report naming this symptom (e.g. `tmp/analysis/{issue-name}.analysis.md`, `tmp/reports/debug-investigate-*.md`) containing the end-to-start trace.
>
> No evidence → NOT run. Recalling that the cause "is known" is not proof. — why: context compaction preserves belief, not findings.
>
> **3. Act.** Not run → run `$debug-investigate` FIRST, then resume `$fix` at planning with its report. This subsumes the spine's step-1 `debugger`. — why: repeating an existing diagnosis double-runs the spine.
>
> **4. Same-problem test.** A prior `$debug-investigate` for a different symptom does NOT satisfy this gate. If `<issues>` is not covered, the gate fires. — why: one investigation per session would license unlimited untraced fixes.
>
> **5. Skip conditions — explicit, narrow, and recorded.** Record which one applies with its proof; never skip silently:
>
> | Condition                                                                                                                  | Skip? |
> | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----- |
> | Same-problem evidence per §2 exists → cite the `file:line` / task-row proof and proceed                                     | YES   |
> | Fast-mode-trivial bug (**ALL 5** `Default Mode Policy` opt-out conditions hold) → MAY inline the end-to-start trace instead of spawning the skill; the trace itself is still REQUIRED | PARTIAL |
> | Active parent workflow row whose sequence **already executed** `debug-investigate` for this problem → cite the completed step | YES   |
> | Active parent workflow row **alone**, with no completed `debug-investigate` step for this problem                            | **NO** |
>
> **The last row is the hole this gate closes.** A parent workflow row may exist while its `debug-investigate` step never ran, covered another symptom, or was skipped. This gate adds completed same-problem proof; it never relaxes the contract. — why: a container task is not evidence that its work happened.
>
> **BLOCKED until:** the §2 check is stated with its evidence (or its explicit skip row + proof) AND a root-cause trace for this problem exists. **NEVER** proceed to plan or edit on "the cause is obvious" alone.

## Standalone Mode Minimum Contract (Non-Workflow Only)

> **Workflow context:** `$fix` normally runs inside `workflow-bugfix`, whose sequence (`investigate → debug-investigate → spec [mode=amend] → plan → … → fix → … → spec [mode=sync] → workflow-review-changes`) supplies diagnosis, spec sync, and review. Standalone `$fix` diagnoses and patches but does not guarantee root-cause ownership, alignment with the business spec root (default `docs/specs/`; `specRoots.business.path` in `docs/project-config.json` overrides), or review; without this contract it risks symptom-patching + spec drift.
>
> **Scope:** applies with no parent workflow. No-flag runs the full diagnose→fix path; `--target={ci|issue|logs|test|types|ui}` branches remain self-contained for diagnosis, skip §1/§2 duplication, and inherit mandatory §3 test-update, §4 spec-correctness, the production-code `$changes-review` gate, and §5 `$why-review` gates. A branch's own `tester` / `code-reviewer` sub-agent step does not replace `$changes-review`.
>
> **Detect mode:** call the current task list first (per Nested Task Expansion). An active parent workflow row skips this section because the workflow owns these steps, but the Root-Cause Prerequisite Gate still requires a completed, same-problem `debug-investigate`; presence alone is insufficient. No parent row → standalone: before the first code edit, MUST ATTENTION create this ordered minimum spine as task tracking todos:
>
> 1. **`$debug-investigate`** — root cause FIRST; §2 evidence decides whether it already ran. Trace symptom end-to-start to the invariant-owning layer with `file:line`, hypothesis matrix, and forward proof. This is standalone diagnosis and subsumes the spine's step-1 `debugger`; resume at planning with its report. Fast-mode-trivial bugs may inline the trace, but the trace remains required.
> 2. **Fix spine** — this skill's `plan → 🛑 approve → implement` body below; Validate-Before-Fix remains unchanged.
> 3. **`$integration-test` test-update gate** — **MUST ATTENTION — MANDATORY after the fix for every standalone call.** Invoke it first to inspect changed behavior and add/update regression coverage. Use integration coverage across a real process/service boundary or for externally observable behavior; use `$test` only for a justified unit seam and record why. An existing suite run does not replace a regression update. Read `integration-test-reference.md` from the reference-docs root (default `docs/project-reference`; `docsRoots.projectReference.path` in `docs/project-config.json` overrides) first.
> 4. **`$spec` spec-correctness check** — *CONDITIONAL, ensures spec docs aren't left stale.* From the proven root cause, decide which case holds:
>    - **Spec WRONG / stale** — behavior was never true or intended behavior changed without a spec update → run `$spec [mode=amend]` for §1-§7, then `$spec [mode=sync]` for §8 `TC-{FEATURE}-{NNN}` ↔ integration tests.
>    - **Spec CORRECT, code failed it** — no §1-§7 amendment. If the bug case is absent from §8, run `$spec [mode=tests]` to add it, then `$spec [mode=sync]`; if an existing TC covers it, record `Spec verified correct, bug case already in §8 — no spec change (code-only defect)` with `file:line`. Never leave the bug case absent from §8.
>    - **No governing spec** — record `No governing spec — nothing to amend` with `file:line`; if warranted, run `$spec [mode=init]`, then `[mode=tests]` to seed the bug-case regression TC. Decide explicitly; skip only amendment, never the decision.
> 5. **`$why-review`** — final todo after fix, test, spec decision, and `$changes-review`; sign off root-cause ownership, lowest-layer fix, no symptom patch, regression coverage, and justified §4 decision. Reporting "done" is blocked until it passes. Trivial non-functional fixes may satisfy it inline/briefly.
>
> **Production-code fixes:** add `$changes-review` before §5; the shared Standalone Review Gate owns placement and inside-workflow skip. **Final standalone order:** `debug-investigate → [fix spine] → $integration-test` (or justified `$test`) → spec-check → changes-review (production code) → `$why-review`.

## Debug Mindset (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**Skeptical + sequential. Every claim needs traced proof; confidence >80% to act.**

- Verify every hypothesis against an actual code trace; do NOT trust the first guess — why: nearest attention often finds the symptom, not the cause.
- Root-cause claims require `file:line` evidence; without a trace, state "hypothesis, not confirmed".
- Question cause and completeness: trace execution, related paths, and contributing factors.
- No "should fix it" without proof that the fix addresses the traced root cause.

## ⚠️ MANDATORY: Confidence & Evidence Gate

**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** declare `Confidence: X%` with evidence list + `file:line` proof for EVERY claim.
**95%+** recommend freely | **80-94%** with caveats | **60-79%** list unknowns | **<60% STOP — gather more evidence.**

**Ultrathink** plan and start fixing these issues; follow Orchestration Protocol, Core Responsibilities, Subagents Team, Development Rules:
<issues>$ARGUMENTS</issues>

## Target Routing (`--target=`)

`$fix` is an intelligent router. With no flag it runs the full diagnose→fix spine below. Pass `--target=` to scope the run to a self-contained inline branch:

| `--target` | Behavior                                                                  |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `types`    | **Inline branch (below)** — TypeScript / type-error resolution.           |
| `ci`       | **Inline branch (below)** — CI / pipeline failure triage.                 |
| `issue`    | **Inline branch (below)** — tracked issue / ticket resolution.            |
| `logs`     | **Inline branch (below)** — log / stack-trace-driven debugging.           |
| `test`     | **Inline branch (below)** — failing-test repair.                          |
| `ui`       | **Inline branch (below)** — UI / visual-defect fixes.                     |

No `--target` (or an unrecognized value) → run the full Workflow spine below; infer the right specialization from `<issues>`.

> **Target routing:** `--target=ci|issue|logs|test|ui` are inline `$fix` branches; invoke them through `$fix --target=...`, not separate skill names.

### `--target=types` — TypeScript / type-error branch

Run `tsc --noEmit` (or `nx build` / `bun run typecheck` / `npx tsc`) to gather all type errors, then:

1. **Collect** — Capture every type error with `file:line`.
2. **Classify** — Group by cause: missing types, wrong signatures, import/export issues.
3. **Fix at root** — Give each value its real, specific type (or `unknown` + a narrowing guard). Do NOT use `any` to silence the checker — `any` ships the underlying type defect. Fix the root cause (wrong interface, missing export), not the symptom site. — why: `any` silences the checker and lets the type defect ship.
4. **Repeat** until `tsc --noEmit` is clean — zero type errors.
5. **🛑 Validate Before Fix:** present errors + root cause by asking the user directly, get approval before code changes (skip if inside a workflow).

The Debug Mindset, Confidence & Evidence Gate, and all SYNC gates below apply to this branch unchanged.

### `--target=ci` — CI / pipeline-failure branch

**Goal:** Analyze CI/CD pipeline logs to identify and fix build/test failures in the configured CI provider/tooling.

**Key Rules:**

- **Infrastructure context:** read `docs/project-config.json` → `infrastructure.cicd.tool` to identify the CI provider/tooling (e.g. `azure-devops`, `github-actions`, `gitlab-ci`); target that provider's pipeline config files.
- Focus on CI-specific issues (env vars, Docker, dependencies, build order).
- Verify the fix does not break local development.

**Workflow:**

1. Use the `debugger` subagent to read the CI logs via the configured CI tool/API (from `docs/project-config.json`), analyze the final failing log/error **backward** to the root cause, and report back. Write findings to `tmp/analysis/{ci-issue}.analysis.md`; re-read before implementing.
2. **🛑 Present root cause + proposed fix → ask the user directly → wait for approval.**
3. Implement the fix from the report.
4. Use the `tester` subagent to verify; report back.
5. If tests fail, repeat from step 2.
6. Report a summary of changes; suggest next steps.

**Notes:** Use the CLI/API for the configured CI provider. If it is GitHub Actions and `gh` is unavailable, instruct the user to install and authorize GitHub CLI first.

The Debug Mindset, Confidence & Evidence Gate, and all SYNC gates below apply to this branch unchanged.

### `--target=issue` — tracked-issue / ticket branch

**Goal:** Investigate and fix bugs reported as tracked issues (e.g. GitHub issues) with full traceability.

**Active-goal read (BEFORE root-cause work):** resolve the active Goal Contract per `SYNC:goal-contract-satisfaction-loop` (active plan `goal.md` → `plans/goals/{YYMMDD-HHmm}-{slug}/goal.md`, plans root default `plans/` with `docsRoots.plans.path` in `docs/project-config.json` overriding → create from the issue). Map the ticket's acceptance criteria to the saved success criteria; after the fix, append proof evidence and remaining gaps to the Iteration Log. Closure is blocked while any required criterion remains FAIL.

**Key Rules:**

- Link the fix back to the issue for traceability.
- Verify the fix addresses the specific reproduction steps from the issue.

**Workflow:**

1. Activate `debug-investigate` and follow its workflow; this satisfies the Root-Cause Prerequisite Gate—record its report path as §2 evidence.
   > **AI Debugging Protocol:** frame the observed symptom, trace reader → storage/projection → writer → consumer/job → producer/origin, enumerate feeder paths, record hypotheses, and prove convergence forward.
   > **MUST ATTENTION READ** `.claude/docs/AI-DEBUGGING-PROTOCOL.md` for full search, risk, and confirmation rules.
2. Use external memory at `tmp/analysis/issue-[number].analysis.md` for structured analysis. **Re-read the ENTIRE analysis file before proposing any fix.**
3. **🛑 Present root cause + proposed fix → ask the user directly → wait for approval before implementing.**
4. Implement the approved fix.

> **Standalone Review Gate (non-workflow only):** any standalone production-code fix — the no-flag spine (Standalone Mode Minimum Contract above) **or** any `--target={ci|issue|logs|test|types|ui}` branch — adds a `$changes-review` task tracking todo as the **final changes-review gate**, placed immediately before the contract's §5 `$why-review` terminal sign-off (test-update → spec-check → changes-review → why-review). A fix touching no production code (test-only, docs-only) skips it with that reason recorded. Inside a workflow, skip — the sequence handles `$changes-review`.

> **Review-loop severity floor (when `$fix` is the fix half of a review loop):** use the canonical `.claude/scripts/lib/review-policy.cjs` predicate and fix only validated findings that block the current round. Classify by consequence: **CRITICAL** = immediate material security/safety/authority/data-loss risk or a failed binary gate; **HIGH** = material supported-path correctness, contract, privacy, authority, compatibility, or likely-harm risk; **MEDIUM** = bounded but consequential edge/resilience/observability/testability/maintainability risk; **LOW** = evidenced non-blocking polish with no credible present correctness, security, privacy, authority, availability, or data-integrity impact. Round 1 is strict (CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW); from round 2 onward only CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM reopen a fix or re-review round, while LOW-only findings are recorded as deferred and do **not** reopen the loop. `NOT VERIFIABLE` is unresolved evidence, not LOW, and failed binary gates always block. Never re-tier a finding to reach a pass. This bounds loop work only; a standalone user request to fix a LOW-severity issue remains valid and is not refused.

The Debug Mindset, Confidence & Evidence Gate, and all SYNC gates below apply to this branch unchanged.

### `--target=logs` — log / stack-trace branch

**Goal:** Analyze application logs to diagnose and fix runtime errors or unexpected behavior.

**Key Rules:**

- Focus on log patterns: stack traces, error codes, timing anomalies.
- Cross-reference logs with source code to find the actual root cause.

**Workflow:**

1. Check whether `./logs.txt` exists. If missing, set up permanent log piping in the project's script config (`package.json`, `Makefile`, `pyproject.toml`, …): **Bash/Unix** append `2>&1 | tee logs.txt`; **PowerShell** append `*>&1 | Tee-Object logs.txt`. Run the command to generate logs.
2. Use the `debugger` subagent to analyze `./logs.txt`: read with `Grep` `head_limit: 30` (last 30 lines; increase if needed — avoid loading the whole file). Write analysis to `tmp/analysis/{issue-name}.analysis.md`; re-read before fixing.
3. Use the `$investigate` skill to locate the exact source of the issue; report back.
4. Use the `planner` subagent to create an implementation plan; report back.
5. **🛑 Present root cause + fix plan → ask the user directly → wait for approval.**
6. Implement the fix.
7. Use the `tester` subagent to verify; report back.
8. Use the `code-reviewer` subagent to review the changes; report back.
9. If tests fail, repeat from step 3.
10. Report a summary; suggest next steps.

The Debug Mindset, Confidence & Evidence Gate, and all SYNC gates below apply to this branch unchanged.

### `--target=test` — failing-test branch

**Goal:** Run test suites, analyze failures, and fix the underlying code or test issues.

**Active-goal read (BEFORE fixing):** resolve the active Goal Contract per `SYNC:goal-contract-satisfaction-loop` (active plan `goal.md` → `plans/goals/{YYMMDD-HHmm}-{slug}/goal.md`, plans root default `plans/` with `docsRoots.plans.path` in `docs/project-config.json` overriding → create from the reported test failure). Map failing-test evidence (before) and passing-test evidence (after) to the saved success criteria in the Iteration Log — a passing suite that misses a saved required criterion does NOT close the loop.

**Key Rules:**

- Distinguish between code bugs and flawed test expectations.
- Re-run tests after the fix to confirm all pass.
- Read `integration-test-reference.md` from the reference-docs root before reviewing/writing integration tests; consult the business spec root for expected-behavior context when diagnosing failures (defaults `docs/project-reference` / `docs/specs/`; `docsRoots.projectReference.path` and `specRoots.business.path` in `docs/project-config.json` override them).

**Workflow:**

1. Use the `tester` subagent to compile the code and fix any syntax errors.
2. Use the `tester` subagent to run the tests; report back. Write failure analysis to `tmp/analysis/{test-issue}.analysis.md`; re-read before fixing.
3. If tests fail, use the `debugger` subagent to find the root cause; report back.
4. Use the `planner` subagent to create an implementation plan; report back.
5. **🛑 Present root cause + fix plan → ask the user directly → wait for approval.**
6. Implement the plan step by step.
7. Use the `tester` subagent to verify; report back.
8. Use the `code-reviewer` subagent to review the changes; report back.
9. If tests fail, repeat from step 2.
10. Report a summary; suggest next steps.

The Debug Mindset, Confidence & Evidence Gate, and all SYNC gates below apply to this branch unchanged.

### `--target=ui` — UI / visual-defect branch

**Goal:** Diagnose and fix UI/UX issues — layout, styling, responsiveness, and visual bugs.

**Key Rules:**

- Follow the project's documented styling and class-naming convention; use BEM only when the project selects it. Treat styling classes as styling hooks, not semantic E2E locators.
- Check responsive states and sizes supported by the target platform; use breakpoints only where that platform supports them.
- **Pre-read (design authority):** read configured design-system docs and token files when present. Otherwise follow the project's frontend references, accepted ADRs, and observed source; do not invent a shared token system or canonical component classes.

**Required skills (when applicable):** `design` (local design-intelligence search + implementation patterns) → `web-design-guidelines` for web surfaces or the target platform's accessibility guidance for non-web UI (use project guidance when present, otherwise its native standard) → `ui-review` (source-level review when applicable).

**Workflow:**

**FIRST** — use the `design` skill's local search to understand context and common issues:

```bash
py -3 .claude/skills/design/scripts/search.py "<product-type>" --domain product
py -3 .claude/skills/design/scripts/search.py "<style-keywords>" --domain style
py -3 .claude/skills/design/scripts/search.py "accessibility" --domain ux
py -3 .claude/skills/design/scripts/search.py "z-index animation" --domain ux
```

If the user provides screenshots/videos, use the `visual analysis tooling` skill to describe the issue in detail so developers can predict the root causes.

> **🛑 After identifying the UI root cause, present findings + proposed fix → ask the user directly → wait for approval before any code change.**

1. Use the `ui-ux-designer` subagent to implement the fix against the configured design authority, or the brief and observed project conventions when no design system is configured.
2. Capture the affected view and state with platform-supported visual tooling when available, then analyze it with the appropriate visual-analysis skill. Repeat until addressed.
3. Use platform-appropriate automation or interaction checks to verify the fix against the design authority.
4. Use the `tester` subagent to compile and test; report back. Repeat until all tests pass.
5. **If the user approves:** run the `docs-manager` subagent to update `./docs`, and update plan progress inline in the main session.
6. Report a summary; suggest next steps.

The Debug Mindset, Confidence & Evidence Gate, and all SYNC gates below apply to this branch unchanged.

## Workflow:

If screenshots or videos are provided, use `visual analysis tooling` to describe the issue so developers can predict root causes.

### Fulfill the request

**Question Everything:** Use ask the user directly for probing questions about the request, constraints, and true objective. Do not assume; clarify until 100% certain.

- Use ask the user directly to clarify any open questions.
- Ask 1 question at a time; wait for answer before next question.
- No questions → start next step.

> **⚠️ Validate Before Fix (NON-NEGOTIABLE):** After root cause + plan, present findings + plan by asking the user directly and get approval BEFORE code changes; no silent fixes.
> **End-to-Start Trace Gate:** For non-trivial bugs, failed verification, stale/incorrect outputs, or behavior-changing fixes, the root-cause plan MUST ATTENTION include `Debugger Trace: End -> Start`, feeder paths, hypothesis matrix, owning layer, and forward convergence proof. If missing, STOP and run `$debug-investigate` or `$investigate` before planning; the Root-Cause Prerequisite Gate re-checks trace content.

### Fix the issue

**Active-goal read (BEFORE root-cause work):** resolve the active Goal Contract per `SYNC:goal-contract-satisfaction-loop` — active `goal.md` → `plans/goals/{YYMMDD-HHmm}-{slug}/goal.md`, plans root default `plans/` with `docsRoots.plans.path` in `docs/project-config.json` overriding → create from the issue via `.claude/templates/goal-contract-template.md`. Saved success criteria define "fixed"; a local proof missing any required criterion is NOT complete. After proof, append root cause, evidence, and remaining gaps to the Iteration Log. Tiny fixes may skip deeper gates ONLY with a user-accepted reason in the goal file.

Use `debug-investigate` for complex problems, and the skills catalog to activate other needed skills.

1. Use `debugger` subagent to find the root cause and report to the main agent. **Skip when the Root-Cause Prerequisite Gate already ran `$debug-investigate` for this problem**; that report subsumes this step, so resume at planning. — why: repeating diagnosis double-runs the spine.
   1.5. Write results to `tmp/analysis/{issue-name}.analysis.md`; re-read the ENTIRE file before planning.
   1.6. Confirm it contains final symptom → reader → storage/projection → writer → consumer/job → producer/origin, all feeders, hypothesis matrix, owning layer, and forward proof.
2. Use `researcher` subagent to research root causes on the internet if needed; report back.
3. Use `planner` subagent to create the implementation plan from reports; report back.
4. **🛑 Present root cause + fix plan → ask the user directly → wait for user approval.**
5. Use `$plan-execute` SlashCommand to implement plan step by step.
6. Final Report:

- Report changes, brief explanation, getting-started guidance, and next steps.
- Ask whether to commit and push; if yes, use `git-manager` subagent.

* **IMPORTANT:** Sacrifice grammar for concise reports; list unresolved questions at the end, if any.

**REMEMBER:**

- Generate visual assets with `visual analysis tooling`; read/analyze them against requirements. Use media processing for image edits (background removal, adjustment, cropping).

> **Spec-Loop completion gate (canonical: `SYNC:spec-loop-discipline`).** The fix is NOT done until the touched invariants close the loop: (1) every §4 [HARD] rule / §5 invariant the bug violated has a **universally-quantified property TC** ("for ALL inputs in {domain}, {invariant} holds") + boundary counter-case — not just the single reproduction example (this is the property bar the §3 regression-TC must meet, not merely an example case); (2) the fixed core-logic line is **mutation-killed** — if a mutant survives on the changed line the killing test is missing, so the bug can silently return (MUTATION-SCORE bar, not line-coverage %); (3) the finding fed BOTH the spec and the tests per the §3 spec-correctness decision AND a guarding test (Dual-Feedback) — a code-only patch with neither leaves the disease undocumented. Re-verify spec + tests + code together before declaring the fix complete.

## Next Steps (Standalone: after the Minimum Contract completes. Skip if inside workflow.)

> **The Root-Cause Prerequisite Gate and the Standalone Mode Minimum Contract above are NOT optional and NOT a question** — standalone `$fix` has already auto-run `debug-investigate` (gate-enforced) → fix spine → mandatory `$integration-test` test update (or justified `$test` unit-test fallback) → conditional `$spec` check → (`$changes-review` for production code) → `$why-review` as the terminal sign-off. Do not re-ask the user whether to do those; they are the guaranteed floor.
>
> **AFTER that floor is met,** MUST ATTENTION use ask the user directly to offer what lies BEYOND the minimum (user decides):

- **"Proceed with full workflow (Recommended)"** — Hand off to the best-fit workflow (e.g. `workflow-bugfix`) from here to add the remaining gates the minimum spine omits — `plan-validate`, `integration-test-review`, `integration-test-verify`, `production-readiness-review`, `security-review`, `docs-update`.
- **"$test"** — Run the full test suite to verify the fix in context.
- **"Commit & push"** — Hand the proven, reviewed change to the `git-manager` subagent.
- **"Stop here"** — Minimum contract satisfied; user takes it from here.

> If already inside a workflow, skip both the contract and this menu — the workflow sequence handles diagnosis, spec sync, review, and next steps.

> **[IMPORTANT]** Use task tracking to break ALL work into small tasks BEFORE starting — including tasks for each file read. Prevents context loss from long files. For simple tasks, MUST ATTENTION ask user whether to skip.

- `domain-entities-reference.md` under the reference-docs root (default `docs/project-reference`; `docsRoots.projectReference.path` in `docs/project-config.json` overrides) — Domain entity catalog, relationships, cross-service sync (read when task involves business entities/models)

> **End-to-Start Debugger Trace** — For non-trivial bugs, failed verification, regression fixes, behavior-changing code, or unclear code flow, start from the observed final state and walk backward before proposing a fix.
>
> 1. **Frame 0: observed end state** — Name the exact user-visible output, failing assertion, log line, persisted value, API response, rendered UI, or aggregate bucket. Record the reader/query/renderer that produced it with `file:line` evidence.
> 2. **Walk backward one hop at a time** — Trace final reader -> projection/cache/storage -> writer -> consumer/handler/job -> producer/caller -> original trigger. At every hop record: input, transformation, output, owner, and evidence.
> 3. **Enumerate all feeder paths** — Find every upstream producer/caller/event/job that can write into the final path, including retry, async, cache, background, and alternate UI/API paths. Mark each path verified, ruled out, or still unknown.
> 4. **Build the hypothesis matrix** — For each plausible cause, list evidence for, evidence against, how to reproduce/verify, blast radius, and status (`primary`, `contributing`, `ruled out`, `latent`). Do not fix until competing causes are explicitly resolved or bounded.
> 5. **Choose the owning fix layer** — Identify the invariant owner and select the authoritative correction and enforcement points from traced contracts and the project's architecture. Keep validation at untrusted boundaries. Choose a shared point only when evidence shows it owns the invariant for those consumers. A fix at the symptom site is rejected unless the symptom site owns the invariant.
> 6. **Prove convergence forward** — After choosing the fix, walk start -> end again and show how the corrected state reaches the observed final output. Map each root cause to a fix part and each fix part to a test/proof.
>
> **BLOCKED until:** final state named · backward trace written · all feeder paths enumerated · hypothesis matrix completed · owning fix layer justified · forward convergence proof mapped to tests.

> **NEVER:** Start at the first suspicious code path. Collapse multiple producers into one "flow". Treat duplicate symptoms as duplicate records without proving the read model. Skip ruled-out hypotheses.

<!-- SYNC:project-reference-docs-guide -->

> **Project Reference Docs Gate (static JIT)** — Run after task-tracking bootstrap and immediately before target/source file reads, grep, edits, tests, or analysis. Project docs override generic framework assumptions; hooks may remind or accelerate this gate, but never prove that it ran.
>
> 1. Identify scope: file types, domain area, and operation.
> 2. **Read the configured project-config file first, if it exists.** Resolve its path through the project-config loader (default `docs/project-config.json`). **The project config is OPTIONAL: a project with no config is a supported, first-class state, not an error.** When it is absent, run on the framework's portable defaults and derive project facts (paths, run commands, conventions, architecture, test and spec layout) from repository evidence — manifests, lockfiles, scripts, CI definitions, directory layout, root instruction files — stating the assumption whenever one is material; do not block, and do not demand a bootstrap route before ordinary work. When it IS present, the minimum valid shape has a non-empty `project.name`; omitted optional capability properties use neutral defaults or skip that capability. A section its author DECLARED but left malformed or incomplete is a configuration error: fail closed on that section and run `$project-init` or `$project-config` before relying on it, because silently substituting defaults would present wrong project facts as authoritative. Use valid config for the adopter's paths, commands, architecture, specs, tests, and workflows, then verify material hints against repository evidence; never assume generic defaults are project facts.
> 3. **Always-on vs task-specific references:** Project initialization owns and ensures the project's `lessons.md` and docs-index inputs at their configured owner paths. Read them under the static project-context contract independently of task-specific `referenceDocs`; do not append them to that selection. For task-specific docs, when the configured `referenceDocs` property is an array, follow it exactly, including subsets and `[]`. When absent, use the runtime capability-aware resolver: its portable baseline plus only configuration- or repository-evidenced capabilities; a minimal project with no capability evidence may resolve to an empty task-specific set. The full scan-target manifest is a registry of metadata/aliases, not a default selection. Resolve configured paths using `docsRoots.projectReference.path` when present (default `docs/project-reference`; `docsRoots.projectReference.path` in `docs/project-config.json` overrides it). A custom reference doc declares `filename` and `purpose`, with optional `sections`, `templatePath`, and `scanTarget`. Built-in filenames keep their exact framework-owned target; other custom docs default to manual ownership, while `scanTarget: "generic"` opts one exact selected file into evidence-based scanning. Manual docs are not freshness-tracked or impact-routed. Never infer a target by basename; config and runtime path resolution reject lexical traversal and physical symlink escapes.
> 4. Read selected task-specific docs just in time before target work, then state: `Reference docs read: ... | Not applicable: ...`; an explicit empty selection means no task-specific docs are selected by the catalog. Still honor separately required references named by the active skill or task. An absent project config is not a missing doc: proceed on repository evidence and, at most, OFFER `$project-init` or `$project-config` as an optional one-time recording of those facts. If an always-on input or a selected/otherwise required doc is missing or stale, or a declared config section is malformed, use `$project-init` or the narrow owner route (`$project-config`, `$docs-init`, `$scan --target=<key>`, `$ai-context-refresh`) before relying on that input. If Codex mirrors are stale, use the explicit `$sync-codex` route or its documented `$ai-context-refresh` completion handoff for the active source-authoring task. After compaction, resume, delegation, or material context change, repeat selection and reading; prior conversation and hook output are not proof of current loading.
>
> **Ready when:** scope evaluated, the configured project-config file consulted or its absence recorded and the portable-defaults fallback applied, root always-on inputs are confirmed (completing project initialization if they are missing or stale), the declared task-specific `referenceDocs` selection is applied exactly or, when absent, the runtime capability-aware resolver output is applied (which may be empty), selected docs are read or an explicit empty selection is recorded, and the citation emitted.

<!-- SYNC:test-failure-fault-adjudication -->

> **Test-Failure Fault Adjudication** — When a test fails (or you are debugging or fixing a failure), the job is to determine *who is at fault — the source code or the test code*. Getting that verdict right matters more than turning the suite green. Binds every debug / fix / test skill identically.
>
> 1. **Provisional verdict before touching either side.** Classify the observed evidence as SOURCE-WRONG, TEST-WRONG, TEST-NOT-OPTIMAL, ENVIRONMENT-BLOCKED, or AMBIGUOUS; then `$debug-investigate` and trace end-to-start before editing. A green-again suite is NOT the goal.
> 2. **Triangulate against the owner artifact AND the source.** Use the business root selected by `specRoots.business.path`, following the framework config loader's fallback only when the project leaves it unset. Resolve `specArtifacts`: when valid, read its configured `intent/contracts/evidence` sections and locate native cases through configured carriers; when absent, use the strict-default §3 AC / §4 BR / §5 invariant / §8 TC sections. A malformed or unsupported declaration blocks without fallback. Inspect the assertion tied to owner + case/scenario ID + optional variant. The canonical intent decides expected behavior — compare BOTH production source and failing test against it. With no spec, use documented intent / acceptance criteria / caller contract and name that limit. Decide from evidence whether SOURCE or TEST is wrong.
> 3. **Classify who is at fault, then fix the wrong side at its root:**
>     - **SOURCE-WRONG** — production code violates the spec's intended behavior or a clear invariant → fix the source at the owning layer; keep or strengthen the test that caught it.
>     - **TEST-WRONG** — the test encodes a stale or incorrect assertion, setup, or expectation that contradicts intended behavior → fix the test at its root. NEVER weaken an assertion, add a skip, or relax a timeout to force green.
>     - **TEST-NOT-OPTIMAL** — intended behavior is valid but the test seam, timing, or assertion signal is fragile → improve the test without weakening the invariant.
>     - **ENVIRONMENT-BLOCKED** — infrastructure, setup, or external state — including transient resource pressure (RAM/OOM, CPU saturation, disk or temp exhaustion, handle and connection-pool limits, network flakiness, a timeout that is really slowness) — prevents a source/test verdict → preserve diagnostics (exact command, exit code, full output, resource evidence), name the environment remedy, and STOP mutating source or tests until the environment is healthy. This verdict is a FIRST-CLASS candidate weighed in step 1 alongside SOURCE-WRONG and TEST-WRONG — never a fallback reached only after the code looks fine; run `SYNC:environment-fault-hypothesis` to rule it in or out with a stated discriminator. A failure that vanishes on retry stays UNEXPLAINED until its mechanism is named — "flaky" is a symptom, not a verdict.
>     - **AMBIGUOUS** — evidence or intended behavior does not safely select an owner → ask the user or canonical owner before editing.
>     - NEVER change a test to match broken source, and NEVER change source to satisfy a broken test. (Migration code excluded — schema/data migrations are one-time execution paths, not core application logic.)
> 4. **Ask the user when intended behavior is unclear.** If no owner artifact covers the behavior, the configured sections are silent, or the owner is ambiguous about which side is correct, STOP and ask the user or canonical spec owner before editing either side — never silently pick source or test just to make the suite pass.
>
> Reconcile to intended behavior, never to whichever side currently passes — green can encode the very bug.
>
> **Read-only/report-only role boundary:** when this block is carried by a report-only role (`code-reviewer`, `spec-compliance-reviewer`, `tester`, and any other agent whose definition declares it never edits source), "fix the wrong side" means RETURN the adjudicated verdict and the proposed repair to the parent — do not modify source, tests, generated carriers, or user data. The adjudication is the deliverable; the edit is the caller's. Without this sentence the block's step-3 imperatives read as write authority and directly contradict those agents' own declarations (e.g. `tester.md` "NEVER implement fixes"), which is the sibling `SYNC:double-round-trip-review` boundary applied to the same class of carrier.

> **Store disposable generated output in the project workspace.** If an output can be regenerated and is not source code, a canonical source-of-truth, or an intentionally versioned projection, write it under the project-root `tmp/` or `temp/` directory (prefer `tmp/`), scoped to the run. This includes temporary state, integration/E2E results, reports, logs, screenshots, traces, videos, coverage, dumps, and candidate evidence. Never put these outputs in source, docs, the plans root (default `plans/`; a `docsRoots.plans.path` entry in `docs/project-config.json` overrides the path), the team-artifacts root (default `team-artifacts/`; `docsRoots.teamArtifacts.path` in the same config overrides the path), or mirror directories; the project-root `.gitignore` must ignore `/tmp/` and `/temp/` by default. Committed fixtures, accepted baselines, canonical specs/docs, and explicitly versioned generated mirrors remain at their declared owner paths.
> **Judge the environment before judging the code.** A bug report, failed test, error, or unexpected output is not proof of a code defect. Before and during adjudication, weigh environment causes as a competing hypothesis — setup, config, version and dependency state, service dependencies, stale artifacts or leftover state, and transient resource pressure (RAM, CPU, disk, handles, network). State the discriminator you ran; fix an environment cause in the environment, never by editing product code or weakening a test to absorb it.

Measure under ~80 characters; serifs tolerate slightly longer lines and want slightly more line-height than sans at the same size. Hierarchy needs weight/tracking/opacity, not size alone. **Avoid the three commonest tells: accenting a single word in a headline (italic/bold/colour) · ALL CAPS labels · an eyebrow label that names the section the heading already names.**
> - `DD-6` **Structure is information, not decoration.** Outlines, borders, numbering, eyebrows, dividers and labels must encode something about the content. **Before adding numbered markers (`01 / 02 / 03`), check the content really IS a sequence** — a stepped process, timeline or ranking. For every device ask: what does this tell the reader that whitespace would not? Nothing → cut it. **Hero:** open with the most characteristic thing in the subject's world, in whatever form fits (headline, image, animation, live demo, interactive moment) — big-number-plus-small-label-plus-gradient is the DEFAULT treatment, so use it only when it is genuinely best here. **Composition:** rhythm over monotone (same card size, same gap, same density everywhere is the sound of no one deciding); proportions must say something you can articulate; one dominant focal point.
> - `DD-7` **Motion sparingly and deliberately.** Non-user-triggered motion draws attention ONLY. One orchestrated moment — a single page-load sequence or one reveal — lands better than scattered effects; **fade-and-slide-up entrances on each section and hover transitions on every card are the generic default and read as generated.** Motion that ANSWERS a person's action (opening, expanding, confirming) is welcome when it shows what changed. Honour `prefers-reduced-motion`.
> - `DD-8` **Spend boldness once, then remove one accessory.** Let ONE element be the memorable thing and keep everything around it quiet and disciplined; cut any decoration that does not serve the brief. **Critique the BUILT page, not just the plan** — composition, craft (density is a decision, not a constant), content coherence, and CSS honesty (negative margins undoing a parent's padding, `calc()` values that exist only as workarounds, absolute positioning to escape layout flow are lies; the correct answer is always simpler than the hack). Take screenshots to review where the environment supports it — a picture is worth 1000 tokens. Then ask "if they said this lacks craft, what would they point to?" and fix that. **Build the quality floor in silently** — responsive, visible keyboard focus, reduced-motion respected, measured contrast, tokens never raw hex or magic numbers — and watch CSS selector specificity, where a type-based selector (`.section`) and an element-based one (`.cta`) most often cancel each other's padding/margin.
>
> **Memory:** vary between briefs — light and dark, families, direction. NEVER converge on the same choice across generations (Space Grotesk, for example). Where the project already has a design system, tokens, or an `interface-system.md`, ADOPT and record it rather than re-deciding; write back any pattern used 2+ times with measurements worth remembering.
>
> **Skip ONLY** when the change has NO user-facing visual surface (backend-only, tooling, docs) — state that reason explicitly so the skip is auditable, not an omission.

<!-- SYNC:design-review-checklist -->

> **Front-End Design Review Checklist** — the EXECUTABLE review protocol for any artifact carrying a user-facing front-end surface. Full catalog (`A1`…`Q` plus §R, ~155 checks with failure signals and default severities; worked calibration cases in `.claude/docs/design-review-calibration.md`): **`.claude/docs/design-review-checklist.md`**. This gate carries the protocol and the triage pass; the file carries the checks.
>
> **Applies when — and ONLY when — the change, plan, or artifact carries a user-facing front-end surface.** A back-end-only diff, a doc edit, or a config change is `N/A`: state that once and move on. NEVER run a UI review on a non-UI change to manufacture coverage. When it DOES apply, **MUST ATTENTION READ `.claude/docs/design-review-checklist.md` and work its sections** — a review that cites a check ID without opening the catalog is asserting, not checking.
>
> **`CL-1` Context before checks (§0.1).** Establish platform · primary user & expertise · primary task · success metric · constraints · review scope · available artifacts. Fewer than four known → state the gap at the top of the report and mark affected findings **low confidence** — why: a check judged against an unknown task is a guess wearing an ID.
>
> **`CL-2` Evidence or nothing (§0.2).** Every finding cites a specific location (screen · element · `file:line`). NEVER invent a measurement — contrast, tap-target size, and load time that cannot be measured from the given artifact are `NOT VERIFIABLE`, never a guessed number. Tag every finding `MEASURED` · `OBSERVED` · `HEURISTIC`. Status values: `PASS` · `FAIL` · `PARTIAL` · `N/A` · `NOT VERIFIABLE`.
>
> **`CL-3` Severity, then a cap (§0.3).** `P0` blocks task completion / loses data / excludes a protected group (ship blocker) · `P1` significant friction or a legal accessibility floor (fix before release) · `P2` measurable inefficiency (next iteration) · `P3` polish (backlog) · `P4` note. Translate to other dialects (BLOCKED/WARN, Critical–Low, BLOCKING/ADVISORY) ONLY through the §0.3 severity map. Cap the report at the top 10 by severity unless a full audit was requested. A clean section reports "no issues found" — NEVER pad. Every `P0`/`P1` carries a concrete fix.
>
> **`CL-4` Section sweep, in order — over whole SURFACES, not files (§0.5).** Map changed files to the pages/views/dialogs they render into, reconstruct each surface's composition (component tree + style origins; render when it can run, else `ENVIRONMENT-BLOCKED`), then sweep: §A core usability heuristics · §B cognitive load & surface complexity (B12–B15: surface load, progressive disclosure, one job per view, the project's complexity budget) · §C visual design & hierarchy · §D interaction and relevant product states · §E information architecture & container fit (E9–E11: dialog vs full view vs stepped flow vs side panel vs inline) · **§F web / §G mobile — conditional on platform; §H expert & data-heavy use — conditional on usage, not platform** · §I accessibility: use WCAG 2.2 AA as the web baseline and meet any stricter applicable legal or project requirement; for other platforms, use the documented platform standard. Record the selected standard and its source; severity follows the governing release contract · §J content & UX writing · §K trust, ethics & privacy · **§L AI & agentic patterns — conditional on the product having AI features** · §M cross-cutting consistency · **§R forms & data entry — conditional on input: fill the Field Necessity Matrix first** · §N edge-case probes. Make one focused pass per applicable section and record N/A with evidence for sections the surface does not support. Cluster a defect repeated across surfaces into ONE finding; calibrate against `.claude/docs/design-review-calibration.md`.
>
> **`CL-5` Quick Triage Pass (§P)** when a full sweep is not possible — use these prompts for applicable surfaces: (1) can a new user complete the primary task unaided · (2) is feedback timely against the project/platform expectation · (3) do relevant empty/loading/error states offer a forward path · (4) is the primary action obvious and reachable for supported inputs · (5) do contrast and focus meet the selected accessibility standard (WCAG 2.2 AA baseline for web) · (6) can users operate the surface with its supported input modes · (7) do interactive targets meet the platform's size/spacing guidance · (8) are destructive actions recoverable where appropriate · (9) does the surface work at its smallest supported size and required zoom/reflow · (10) are there deceptive or coercive patterns.
>
> **`CL-6` Report shape (§O).** Context (+ known gaps) → Verdict (Ship / Ship with fixes / Do not ship) → What works (2–4 specific strengths, cited) → Findings grouped `P0`→`P3`, each with Location · Evidence + tag · Impact · Principle (checklist ID) · Fix → Open questions → Coverage table. Any `P0` caps the grade at Fail regardless of score; report a score only ALONGSIDE findings, never instead of them.
>
> **Component architecture pass (§M6–§M9) when source code is in scope.** Verify the ownership model documented or demonstrated by the project, reuse/composition decisions, and whether shared behavior is duplicated without a reason. Do not require tiers, a base abstraction, or a particular test hierarchy unless the project uses one. Report applicable checklist IDs with `file:line` evidence; do not infer source architecture from a screenshot alone.
>
> **Precedence and no-double-counting.** The project's design-system / SCSS / frontend-pattern docs and accepted ADRs OUTRANK this checklist; the brief's stated direction outranks aesthetic judgment. A deliberate, documented convention is NEVER a defect — check intent before flagging, and surface a genuine conflict to the user with both sides, NEVER resolve it silently. This checklist is the review PROCEDURE, not a third set of taste rules: `UI-1.1`–`UI-9.4` ask "does it meet the usability floor?", `DD-1`–`DD-8` ask "is this THIS product's interface?", and these checks ask "did the review actually look, with evidence, and rank it?". Where a check restates a `UI-*` or `DD-*` clause, report the defect ONCE under whichever ID the consuming skill already uses.
>
> **For a PLAN or a PLAN REVIEW.** When the plan contains UI work, bind applicable acceptance criteria to the target platform/surface, relevant user states, and the selected accessibility standard. Each UI phase MUST name, per new or reshaped view: its primary task, its container (E9), its information priority (what is shown now / later / never here), and — for input — the inputs required at creation vs deferred (§R1–R2). A plan review treats a UI phase missing these as a finding against the checklist IDs it leaves unbound. Use WCAG 2.2 AA as the web baseline and meet any stricter applicable legal or project requirement; for other platforms, identify the documented platform standard. Identify conditional sections (§F/§G/§H, §L) that apply. Do not require every catalogued state; record the standard and its source, and keep unsupported checks N/A.

<!-- SYNC:severity-rubric -->

> **Severity Rubric** — Classify every finding by consequence, not by effort, reviewer preference, or how annoying the fix is. One scale applies to every review, skill, agent, workflow, and host so a tier has the same meaning everywhere. Choose the highest credible consequence supported by evidence; do not lower a tier to make a round pass.
>
> **Finding vs observation (required):** An observation becomes a finding only when it names the affected user/system/data/contract, the shipped consequence, the evidence location, and the normalized tier. `INFO`, advice, preference, duplicate wording, or an unsubstantiated concern is not a finding and must not reopen a loop. If the concern might affect a required behavior or gate but evidence is incomplete, emit `NOT VERIFIABLE` with the missing evidence and keep it unresolved; never silently convert uncertainty into LOW.
>
> | Severity | Action | Definition and examples |
> | --- | --- | --- |
> | CRITICAL | Block immediately; escalate | Immediate material risk if shipped: authentication/authorization or safety bypass; secrets/PII exposure; irreversible destructive action; data loss/corruption; or a silent failure on a critical path. A failed binary gate that makes the result untrustworthy is represented as a separate synthetic blocker by the executable policy (not as an ordinary severity judgment). |
> | HIGH | Must fix before PASS/merge | Material correctness or contract risk: wrong behavior on a supported path; violated business/data invariant; meaningful privacy or authority gap; breaking API/schema/compatibility change; likely harm to users/downstream systems; or a missing proof for a behavior-changing fix. |
> | MEDIUM | Must clear the current round; escalate if the fix needs an owner decision | Bounded but consequential risk: an edge case, resilience/observability/testability/maintainability gap, credible future defect, or local architectural drift whose impact is real but not immediate material loss. An explicit follow-up records the escalation/residual risk; it does not make an open MEDIUM a clean pass. |
> | LOW | Record and defer; never open another fix/re-review round from round 2 onward, and never counts toward the round-3 extension | Non-blocking polish with no credible present correctness, security, privacy, authority, availability, or data-integrity impact: wording/formatting, minor documentation or convention drift, optional defensive cleanup, or a cosmetic/refinement suggestion. |
>
> **Consequence decision tree (apply in order):** (1) Is a binary gate failed? Keep it as a separate hard blocker (the executable helper represents it as synthetic CRITICAL); do not use the ordinary severity label to hide what failed. Otherwise, would shipping permit immediate material security/safety/authority harm, irreversible destruction, data loss/corruption, or a critical-path silent failure? → **CRITICAL**. (2) Otherwise, does a supported path, invariant, public contract, privacy/authority boundary, compatibility promise, or behavior-changing proof fail with material user/downstream impact? → **HIGH**. (3) Otherwise, is there a bounded but consequential edge, resilience, observability, testability, maintainability, or architectural gap with a credible impact? → **MEDIUM**. (4) Otherwise, is the evidence sufficient to show only non-blocking polish with no credible present material impact? → **LOW**. (5) If the evidence needed to choose between steps 1–4 is missing, → **NOT VERIFIABLE**, not LOW. When multiple tiers fit, select the highest credible consequence; effort, implementation cost, reviewer discomfort, frequency alone, proximity to the round cap, and whether a tier would unlock or forfeit the conditional round-3 extension never decide the tier.
>
> **Boundary examples (normalize before applying the round predicate):** an auth bypass, exposed secret/PII, destructive command without an authority gate, or failed required test/generation/parity gate is **CRITICAL**; a wrong supported response, broken invariant/API/schema, meaningful privacy/authority defect, or unproven behavior-changing fix is **HIGH**; a bounded retry/timeout/alert/testability gap or credible maintainability drift is **MEDIUM**; a typo, formatting inconsistency, optional cleanup, or cosmetic suggestion proven not to affect present behavior is **LOW**. A missing fact about any of those boundaries is **NOT VERIFIABLE** until evidence or an explicitly documented residual-risk decision exists.
>
> **Classification procedure (required for every finding):** (1) state the affected user, system, data, contract, or gate; (2) assess consequence if the issue ships; (3) assess exposure/likelihood and reversibility/detectability; (4) select the highest tier justified by those facts; (5) cite `file:line` or equivalent evidence and a confidence percentage. Effort, implementation cost, reviewer discomfort, and proximity to the round cap are never severity inputs. `NOT VERIFIABLE` is a pending evidence state, not one of the four tiers and never a LOW escape hatch: if the unresolved claim could affect required behavior, security, privacy, authority, availability, data integrity, or a binary gate, it remains an open evidence blocker until resolved or explicitly owner-accepted with documented residual risk. Classify an item LOW only when evidence supports the absence of credible present material impact.
>
> **Hard-gate rule:** Binary gates (tests, required artifacts, security must-fix checks, generated parity, policy compliance) are not ordinary severity-rated findings. The executable helper records a failed gate as a synthetic CRITICAL blocker solely so one predicate can carry it; the report must still name the gate and failure evidence. A failed gate blocks at every round, including when all ordinary findings are LOW; never disguise a failed gate as LOW. A failed non-test gate counts as CRITICAL for the round-3 extension; a failing test gate is outside the round budget and loops until the tests pass.
>
> **Score-based skills** map their numeric scale onto these tiers — do not invent a parallel vocabulary:
>
> - **0-2 criterion scoring** (e.g. production-readiness-review): `0` = CRITICAL/HIGH (criterion unmet, blocks readiness), `1` = MEDIUM (partial, consequential gap), `2` = pass (no finding). If the criterion is only polish, use LOW rather than forcing a `0`.
> - **Two-axis scoring** (e.g. performance-review, impact × likelihood): high impact + high exposure → CRITICAL/HIGH; material impact with bounded exposure → HIGH/MEDIUM; low impact and low exposure → LOW. Record the axes and why the selected tier is the highest credible consequence.
> - **Scorecards / `/20` grades** (e.g. architecture-scalability-review): the aggregate score and verdict band are separate from finding severity. A sub-80 area is evidence to investigate, not an automatic CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW label; classify each underlying gap by the consequence decision tree and keep advisory score deductions separate from blocking findings.
>
> **Domain-vocabulary normalization (mandatory):** Specialized skills may keep a local reporting vocabulary, but it MUST feed this same four-tier round predicate — never a second severity system:
>
> - `BLOCKED`, `HARD FAIL`, or `FAIL` is a blocking local verdict, not an automatic CRITICAL label. Classify the underlying consequence as CRITICAL when it is an immediate material risk or failed binary gate; otherwise classify it as HIGH or MEDIUM with evidence, while preserving the local block until the owning gate is satisfied.
> - `WARN` is not permission to ignore a finding. Map it to MEDIUM when the gap is consequential, to LOW only when evidence supports no credible present material impact, or upward to HIGH/CRITICAL when the consequence warrants it. `PASS`/compliant is not a finding.
> - UI `P0`/`P1`/`P2`/`P3`/`P4` map to CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW/LOW respectively as a starting point; override upward only when the evidence shows a higher shipped consequence. A P0/P1 accessibility or task-completion floor remains a blocking gate even when a local UI report calls it a priority rather than a severity.
> - Numeric SRE/readiness or impact/likelihood scores are evidence inputs, not replacement tiers. Emit the score, the consequence, and the normalized CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW tier together. `INFO`/advisory observations are not findings unless the evidence shows a material consequence.
>
> A finding's tier drives the gate: CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM remain actionable and blocking under the round policy, and only an open CRITICAL/HIGH at round 2 (a failed non-test binary gate counts as CRITICAL) unlocks the single conditional extension round; LOW may be tracked as a follow-up and, from round 2, does not by itself justify another fix/re-review. An owner decision may explain or schedule an open MEDIUM but does not turn it into a clean pass; owner acceptance never makes a failed binary gate pass and must record scope, rationale, and residual risk.

<!-- SYNC:environment-fault-hypothesis -->

> **Environment-Fault Hypothesis** — A bug report, failing test, error, crash, or unexpected output is NOT proof of a code defect. The ENVIRONMENT is a first-class competing hypothesis in every debug / investigation / adjudication — weighed from the start, never a fallback reached only after the code looks fine.
>
> 1. **Sweep environment preconditions BEFORE deep tracing** — it is cheap and it reframes everything downstream: toolchain/runtime/SDK version · dependency install state (lockfile drift, partial restore, stale build/cache/generated artifacts) · env vars, secrets, config or profile selection · service dependencies actually up, migrated and seeded (DB, broker, cache, container/compose, external API) · ports, network, proxy, DNS, TLS/cert, system clock · OS/platform, path separators, line endings, locale/timezone · permissions and file locks · leftover state from a prior run (stale processes, containers, volumes, held ports, test data, dirty working tree).
> 2. **Name resource pressure and transience as explicit suspects** — RAM/OOM and swap pressure · CPU saturation or throttling (parallel test workers, noisy neighbour, small CI runner) · disk, inode or temp-dir exhaustion · file-handle and connection-pool limits · network flakiness and rate limits · a timeout that is really slowness. **Tell-tale shape:** non-deterministic · timing-dependent · passes alone but fails in parallel · fails only on one machine or only on CI · the error names resources, not business rules.
> 3. **Discriminate — then cite the discriminator.** Does it reproduce deterministically on a clean environment? Did code on the failing path change since it last passed (`git log` / `git diff` that path)? Does it fail for every machine/actor or exactly one? Does concurrency 1, a clean rebuild, or a fresh container change the result? A verdict without a discriminator you actually ran is a guess — for the environment AND for the code.
> 4. **Report an environment cause AS an environment cause.** Preserve diagnostics (exact command, exit code, full output, resource evidence, timestamps), name the setup/cleanup/provisioning remedy and its owner, and STOP mutating source or tests. NEVER edit product code, weaken an assertion, relax a timeout, or skip a test to absorb an environment fault — that hides the real defect and permanently rots the test.
> 5. **Flaky is a symptom, not a verdict.** A failure that vanishes on retry stays UNEXPLAINED until its mechanism is named. Record it with its evidence; fix the environment or the test seam. Retry-until-green is not a resolution.
>
> **BLOCKED until:** `- [ ]` Precondition sweep done `- [ ]` Resource/transience suspects considered `- [ ]` Discriminator run and cited `- [ ]` Verdict names CODE or ENVIRONMENT with evidence
>
> **NEVER:** Treat "the test failed" as "the code is wrong". Conclude "just flaky" without a mechanism. Absorb an environment fault into source or tests. Chase a code hypothesis while an unchecked environment precondition is still in play.

- **MANDATORY** The project-init-owned `lessons.md` and docs-index inputs are always-on at their configured owner paths, read independently of task-specific `referenceDocs`. A missing/stale root instruction file or required reference doc, or a malformed declared config section → auto-run `$project-init` (or the narrow lower-level route) before relying on that input.

A matching `referenceDocs[]` filename may relocate the index within that root; this registry is independent from task-specific reference-doc selection, so omitted or empty `referenceDocs` does not disable it. The index's `**Protocols directory:**` header selects a project-root-relative body directory (default `docs/project-protocols/`). Match this skill against the `Target` column and take the most specific tier ONLY — exact name > glob > `*`. **That precedence orders overlays against EACH OTHER, never against this skill.** Read only matched bodies derived as `<protocols-dir>/<Name>.md`; the row's Body link is display text, never a read path. Reject unsafe paths without reading. A matched body that is missing or malformed is REPORTED and skipped — never reconstructed from the index Description.

**MUST ATTENTION** environment-fault gate: a bug, failed test, error, or odd output is NOT proof of a code defect. Sweep environment preconditions (versions, deps/install state, config & env vars, services, ports/network/clock, permissions, leftover state) and resource/transience suspects (RAM, CPU, disk, handles, network, timeouts) as a competing hypothesis, cite the discriminator you ran, and fix an environment cause in the environment — never by editing code or weakening a test. "Flaky" is a symptom, not a verdict.

## Closing Reminders

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION Goal:** Eliminate each issue's root cause with end-to-start `file:line` evidence, fix the lowest invariant-owning layer (never the crash site), and add or update regression coverage that proves the fix converges.

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION — Main steps:** route `--target=` first → pass the Root-Cause Prerequisite Gate → investigate with researcher subagents → diagnose end-to-start with `debug-investigate` → declare confidence/evidence → plan impact → pass Validate-Before-Fix approval → implement at the owning layer → update regression tests → decide spec correctness/sync → run `$changes-review` for production code → finish with `$why-review`; standalone calls keep the full spine, while parent workflows own their declared sequence.

**MUST ATTENTION — Protocols in force (concise digest of the SYNC/shared blocks this skill carries):**

- **End-To-Start Debugger Trace:** start at observed final output, trace backward through every feeder path before fixing.
- **Root Cause Debugging:** reproduce → isolate → trace → hypothesize → verify → fix the cause, never symptoms.
- **Nested Task Creation:** parent workflow rows don't replace child phase tracking; expand and link phases.
- **Project Reference Docs Guide:** read required project-reference docs (`lessons.md` always) before target work.
- **Task Tracking & External Report:** bootstrap task tracking; persist plan/review findings to `tmp/reports/` incrementally.
- **Critical Thinking:** apply critical + sequential thinking; traced proof per claim, confidence >80% to act.
- **Understand Code First:** search 3+ patterns and read code before any modification.
- **Evidence-Based Reasoning:** cite `file:line` for every claim; <60% confidence = do NOT recommend.
- **Fix-Layer Accountability:** trace full data flow, fix at the owning layer, not the crash site.
- **Source/Test Drift Check:** when source behavior changes, decide from evidence whether affected tests change.
- **AI Mistake Prevention:** verify generated content against evidence, trace downstream references, verify all affected outputs, re-read after context loss, surface ambiguity.

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** Root-Cause Prerequisite Gate (BLOCKING, FIRST) — a direct `$fix` call (no-flag spine AND every `--target=` branch) MUST NOT edit code until `$debug-investigate` traced THIS problem in THIS session, proven by a the current task list row or a written investigation report; recall is NOT evidence, a prior investigation of a DIFFERENT symptom does NOT count, and a parent workflow row alone is NOT proof its diagnosis step ran — not satisfied → run `$debug-investigate` first, then resume from the planning step — why: without it the first edit lands with zero traced cause and patches the symptom site
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** trace the symptom end-to-start to the invariant-owning layer and fix there — NEVER at the crash site — why: the crash site is a symptom; the bad state enters at a lower layer and one fix there protects all downstream consumers
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** declare `Confidence: X%` + `file:line` proof for EVERY claim — 95%+ recommend, 80-94% caveats, 60-79% list unknowns, STOP if <60% — why: speculation patches the wrong layer and ships the disease
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** 🛑 Validate-Before-Fix — present root cause + plan by asking the user directly and get approval BEFORE any code change (skip ONLY inside a workflow) — why: silent fixes bypass the human gate on irreversible code change
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** route on `--target=` FIRST — each `{ci|issue|logs|test|types|ui}` branch is self-contained (own diagnosis); no flag = full diagnose→fix spine — why: branches must not re-run §1/§2 of the standalone spine
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** default mode HARD (full rigor) — opt out to fast mode ONLY when the bug is genuinely trivial (ALL 5 Default Mode Policy conditions met); when in doubt default hard — why: skipping diagnosis on a non-trivial bug fixes the symptom and leaves the disease
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** standalone (no parent workflow) self-assembles the spine `debug-investigate → fix → $integration-test test-update (or justified $test unit-test fallback) → $spec correctness check → $changes-review (production code) → $why-review`; invoke `$integration-test` after every standalone fix to add or update regression coverage, and use `$test` only for an evidence-backed unit-test seam — inside a workflow SKIP the contract — but NEVER the Root-Cause Prerequisite Gate, which still demands proof the sequence's `debug-investigate` step ran for this problem — why: standalone has no sequence supplying diagnosis, test updates, spec sync, or review; and a container row is not proof its diagnosis step ran
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** spec-loop completion — the fix is NOT done until the violated §4/§5 invariant has a universally-quantified property TC + boundary case, the changed line is mutation-killed, and the finding fed BOTH spec and tests (Dual-Feedback) — why: a code-only patch leaves the bug case undocumented and able to silently return
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** break work into small task tracking todos BEFORE starting (one read = one task); call the current task list first on context loss to resume, never duplicate — why: long debug files exhaust context and silently lose findings
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** read required project-reference docs (`lessons.md` always; `integration-test-reference.md` for test branch; the business spec root, default `docs/specs/` and overridable via `specRoots.business.path` in `docs/project-config.json`, for behavior) before target work — why: project conventions override generic debugging assumptions
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** on a FAILED TEST (`--target=test` or any test failure), FIRST read the `$integration-test-review` skill protocol (assertion-quality, coverage & spec↔test↔code fault gates) to set fix direction — decide whether the fault is a source-code root cause or a test-code setup/assertion issue — why: fixing without that verdict patches the wrong side and can green a broken invariant.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** search 3+ similar patterns and read existing code before any fix; evaluate fit before copying a nearby pattern — why: closest example ≠ matching preconditions
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** add a final review todo to verify work quality, then extract root-cause lessons (`$learn`) if the failure mode would recur without the reminder

**Anti-Rationalization:**

| Evasion                                  | Rebuttal                                                                                          |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| "Root cause is obvious, just patch it"   | Trace end-to-start to the invariant owner with `file:line` first — the obvious site is the symptom. |
| "I already investigated this"            | Show the the current task list row or investigation report for THIS symptom. Recall is not evidence — after compaction the belief survives, the findings do not. |
| "A workflow is running, it handled diagnosis" | A parent row is a container, not proof. Cite the *completed* `debug-investigate` step for this problem or the gate fires. |
| "`--target=` scopes it, so no trace needed"   | Every branch passes through the Root-Cause Prerequisite Gate. A `debugger`/`tester` subagent step is not an end-to-start trace. |
| "Fix it where it crashes"                | Crash site ≠ cause site. Fix at the project-identified owner of the invariant and protect all relevant consumers. |
| "Add a `?.` / guard and move on"         | Scattered defensive checks = wrong layer. One authoritative fix beats many guards.               |
| "Confident enough, skip evidence"        | No `file:line` + Confidence % = no claim. STOP and gather evidence if <60%.                       |
| "Small fix, skip the approval gate"      | 🛑 Validate-Before-Fix is non-negotiable standalone — present root cause + plan, get approval.    |
| "Tests pass, the fix is done"            | Not done until property TC + boundary case exist, the changed line is mutation-killed, and spec ↔ tests fed (Dual-Feedback). |
| "Already searched the codebase"          | Show `file:line` evidence. No proof = no search.                                                 |

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** NEVER edit code until `$debug-investigate` traced THIS problem in THIS session — evidence (task row / report), not recall.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** NEVER fix at the crash site — trace end-to-start to the invariant owner and fix there.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** declare `Confidence: X%` + `file:line` for every claim; STOP if <60%.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** 🛑 Validate-Before-Fix approval before any code change — never skip it.

**[TASK-PLANNING]** Before acting, analyze task scope and systematically break into small todo tasks and sub-tasks via task tracking.

> **AI-SDD Artifact Contract** — Shared spec-driven development rules stay portable and source-owned.
>
> 1. Keep reusable AI-SDD principles in `.claude`; put repository-specific paths, commands, owners, products, and formats in project config/reference docs.
> 2. Preserve cycle: `spec -> plan -> tasks -> implement -> verify -> update spec/docs`.
> 3. Resolve `specArtifacts` before selecting identity or carrier: use a valid profile, use strict-default TC/test identity only when the profile is absent, and block a malformed or unsupported declaration. Trace every requirement or invariant through decision, task, configured case/test identity and inspected assertion evidence, then carry it through source evidence and canonical docs/spec updates.
> 4. Treat code-to-spec extraction as reference-only until accepted by the canonical spec owner.
> 5. Any supported AI tool may plan, implement, review, or verify with synced context; using multiple tools is optional.
> 6. Update `.claude` source first, then sync generated mirrors; do not manually edit `.agents`, `.codex`, or `AGENTS.md`. — why: mirrors are generated artifacts; hand-edits are overwritten on the next sync

## SYNC:ai-sdd-artifact-contract:reminder

- **MANDATORY** Apply `shared/sdd-artifact-contract.md`; keep reusable AI-SDD in `.claude` and local rules in project docs.
- **MANDATORY** Resolve and validate `specArtifacts`: use valid native owner/case/variant identity and assertion-bearing evidence; use strict-default TC/TestSpec only when the profile is absent; block a malformed or unsupported declaration without fallback.
- **MANDATORY** Code-to-spec extraction is reference-only until canonical acceptance; any supported AI tool may execute with synced context.
- **MANDATORY** Update `.claude` source before syncing generated mirrors; do not manually edit `.agents`, `.codex`, or `AGENTS.md`.
- **MANDATORY** Missing or stale project config, root instruction files, or required reference docs route project-specific work through `$project-init` or the narrow setup route automatically.
**[TASK-PLANNING] [MANDATORY]** BEFORE executing any workflow or skill step, create/update task tracking for all planned steps, analyze the task graph (output dependencies, shared write targets) into ordered parallel waves per PARALLELIZE before starting any task, then keep it synchronized as each step starts/completes. Preserve fixed ordering when a skill or workflow explicitly fixes it.
- **MANDATORY** Pin `Original goal:` before the first action and keep `User prompts this session: P1…Pn` current; re-read both at every step, before delegation, and after compaction.
- **MANDATORY** Before claiming done, map the result to the original goal and every prompt (`P# → done | deferred | n/a`); never store secrets in them.
## [LESSON-LEARNED-REMINDER] [BLOCKING] Task Planning & Continuous Improvement — MANDATORY. Do not skip.

Break work into small tasks (task tracking) before starting. Add final task: "Analyze AI mistakes & lessons learned".

**Extract lessons — ROOT CAUSE ONLY, not symptom fixes:**
1. Name the FAILURE MODE (reasoning/assumption failure), not symptom — "assumed API existed without reading source" not "used wrong enum value".
2. Generality test: does this failure mode apply to ≥3 contexts/codebases? If not, abstract one level up.
3. Write as a universal rule — strip project-specific names/paths/classes. Useful on any codebase.
4. Consolidate: multiple mistakes sharing one failure mode → ONE lesson.
5. **Recurrence gate:** "Would this recur in future session WITHOUT this reminder?" — No → skip `$learn`.
6. **Auto-fix gate:** "Could `$code-review`/`$code-simplifier`/`$security-review`/a linter catch this?" — Yes → improve review skill instead.
7. BOTH gates pass → ask user to run `$learn`.
**[CRITICAL-THINKING-MINDSET]** Apply critical thinking, sequential thinking. Every claim needs traced proof, confidence >80% to act.
**Anti-hallucination principle:** Never present guess as fact — cite sources for every claim, admit uncertainty freely, self-check output for errors, cross-reference independently, stay skeptical of own confidence — certainty without evidence root of all hallucination.
**AI Attention principle (Primacy-Recency):** Put the 3 most critical rules at both top and bottom of long prompts/protocols so instruction adherence survives long context windows.
**Goal-driven execution:** Define success criteria first, loop until verified, and stop only when observable checks pass.
**Tests verify intent:** Tests must protect business rules/invariants and fail when the protected intent breaks, not only mirror current behavior.
## Common AI Mistake Prevention (System Lessons)

- **Resolve project applicability before using framework examples.** Read the project config and relevant references, then inspect local evidence; honor explicit N/A and never impose a language, framework, architecture layer, styling method, tool, or runtime surface the project does not use.
- **ROOT-CAUSE GATE — INVESTIGATE FIRST.** Before applying any project-related correction, always use the project's root-cause investigation protocol and establish the cause; the failure site may be only a symptom.
- **FAILED-TEST GATE.** For any failed or unstable test, use the project's test-investigation protocol before editing source or tests; never change either side merely to force green.
- **Re-read files after context compaction.** Edit requires prior Read in same context; compaction wipes read state. Re-read before editing.
- **Grep for old terms after bulk replacements.** AI over-trusts find/replace completeness. Grep full repo after bulk edits for missed refs in docs/configs/catalogs.
- **Check downstream references before deleting.** Deletions cascade doc/code staleness. Map referencing files before removal.
- **After memory loss, check existing state before creating new.** Compaction wipes prior-work memory. Query current state to resume — never blindly duplicate.
- **Verify AI-generated content against actual code.** AI hallucinates APIs, class names, method signatures. Grep to confirm existence before documenting/referencing.
- **Trace full dependency chain after edits.** Changing a definition misses downstream consumers. Trace the full chain.
- **When renaming, grep ALL consumer file types.** Some file types silently ignore missing refs (no compile error). Search code, templates, configs, generated files.
- **Trace ALL code paths when verifying correctness.** Code existing ≠ code executing. Trace early exits, error branches, conditional skips — not just happy path.
- **Update docs that embed canonical data when source changes.** Docs inlining derived data (workflows, schemas, configs) go stale silently. Update all embedding docs alongside source.
- **Verify sub-agent results after context recovery.** Background agents may finish while parent compacted — grep-verify output, don't trust assumed completion.
- **Cross-check full target list against sub-agent assignments.** Parallel sub-agents by category miss boundary items. Reconcile union of assignments against target list before proceeding.
- **Sub-agents inherit knowledge only from their agent .md definition — use custom agent types, not built-in Explore.** Tool adoption = permission + knowledge + enforcement (numbered workflow step).
- **Persist sub-agent findings incrementally, not as a final batch.** Long sub-agents hit cutoffs before final write — findings lost. Instruct append-per-section to report file.
- **Ownership before action.** When investigating a failure, ask which part owns the behavior before changing anything. Trace the wrong state to the component responsible for its invariant, then make one authoritative correction there.
- **Test failure → record a provisional verdict before trace/edit, then investigate.** Use the full five-way taxonomy: SOURCE-WRONG (production violates intent), TEST-WRONG (assertion/setup is stale), TEST-NOT-OPTIMAL (valid but fragile or low-signal test), ENVIRONMENT-BLOCKED (external state prevents a verdict), or AMBIGUOUS (intent/evidence cannot choose safely). Then trace root cause and triangulate against the governing spec if one exists (the business spec root — default `docs/specs`; a `specRoots.business.path` entry in `docs/project-config.json` overrides the path) AND source. NEVER weaken an assertion, add a skip, relax a timeout, or change source merely to force green.
- **Grep ALL removed names after extraction/refactoring.** Primary file "done" ≠ secondary files clean. Grep entire scope for every removed symbol before declaring complete.
- **Assume existing values are intentional — ask WHY before changing OR flagging one as a defect.** Pattern-matching as "wrong" skips context. Before changing or reporting any constant/limit/flag/cutoff: read comments, git blame, the CALLER's ordering (the guarantee that makes the value correct usually lives in code running immediately BEFORE the cited line), and 2+ sibling call sites of the same convention. A doc stating WHAT without WHY is missing rationale, not proof of a missing guard — and in a validation pass, an accurate `file:line` citation proves the transcription, never the defect.
- **Verify ALL affected outputs, not just the first.** One build green ≠ all green. Multi-stack changes (backend/frontend/tests/docs) require verifying EVERY output.
- **Evaluate fit before copying a nearby pattern.** Closest example ≠ matching preconditions — verify the new context shares the same constraints, base classes, scope, lifetime.
- **Holistic analysis — resist the nearest-attention trap.** Do not dive into the first plausible cause. List every precondition (configuration, environment, inputs, dependencies, versions, permissions, and state). Verify each against evidence, not intuition. Ask "what would falsify this?" — if nothing, it is not a hypothesis. The most expensive failure is going deeper into an assumed area while the real issue sits in an unexamined condition.
- **Minimal changes — apply the relevance test.** Every change must trace to the reported problem; avoid unrelated cleanup. For review or enhancement work, announce improvements beyond the main request rather than silently expanding scope. Ask: "Would this change exist if I were not addressing this request?" — if not, remove it or disclose it.
- **Surface ambiguity before coding — don't pick silently.** Multiple valid interpretations → present each with effort: "[Request] could mean (1) [N h], (2) [N h]. Which matters?" List scope/format/volume/constraints assumptions first. If simpler path exists, say so. Never silently pick.
- **Why-Review adversarial mindset — apply when reviewing any plan, decision, or design.** Default SKEPTIC not VALIDATOR: steel-man a rejected alternative, invert each stated reason ("what does it sacrifice?"), stress-test top 2-3 assumptions, run pre-mortem ("ships, fails in 3 months — what breaks?"), surface 1-2 alternatives author missed. Section presence ≠ quality; quality = causal reasoning + concrete mitigations + evidence, not "it's better" or "monitor closely".
- **Front-load report-write in sub-agent prompts for large reviews.** Many-file sub-agents hit budget before final write — findings lost. Design prompts so: (1) report-write is first explicit deliverable, (2) append per-file/section (not batched), (3) scope bounded so reads don't exhaust budget. Truncated mid-sentence with no report file → spawn narrower scope, don't retry same prompt.
- **After context compaction, re-verify all prior phase outcomes before continuing.** Summaries describe intent, not environment state (git index, filesystem, processes). On resume, FIRST audit: git status, re-read modified files, verify filesystem. Every "completed" claim is an untested hypothesis until evidence confirms.
- **OOM/memory: check row count before row size.** Triage: (1) Unbounded query — no DB filter for trigger? Push filter to DB; eliminates OOM. (2) Large rows? Projection reduces proportionally. Row reduction > projection in ROI.
- **Assert the outcome your system OWNS, never the intermediate state your INFRASTRUCTURE owns.** When testing anything asynchronous (queue/broker delivery, retries, background jobs, caches, replication), assert the final business/entity state. NEVER assert the delivery bookkeeping — consume/send status, attempt counts, last-error, row existence or counts in a broker, scheduler, or outbox/inbox table. That bookkeeping lives in shared infrastructure that ANY co-running process (a peer worker, a second replica, a leftover local container) can write, usually under a deterministic shared key, so the assertion silently tests the developer's environment instead of the system: green when run alone, flaky the instant anything else shares that broker + database. Gate question for every assertion: "would this hold no matter WHICH process did the work?" — if no, assert the converged data state instead. Corollary: process-local fault injection and in-process telemetry cannot gate work any process may perform — use them as stress amplifiers (arm → bounded window → disarm → assert convergence), never as preconditions.
- **Store disposable generated output in the project workspace.** If an output can be regenerated and is not source code, a canonical source-of-truth, or an intentionally versioned projection, write it under the project-root `tmp/` or `temp/` directory (prefer `tmp/`), scoped to the run. This includes temporary state, integration/E2E results, reports, logs, screenshots, traces, videos, coverage, dumps, and candidate evidence. Never put these outputs in source, docs, the plans root (default `plans/`; a `docsRoots.plans.path` entry in `docs/project-config.json` overrides the path), the team-artifacts root (default `team-artifacts/`; `docsRoots.teamArtifacts.path` in the same config overrides the path), or mirror directories; the project-root `.gitignore` must ignore `/tmp/` and `/temp/` by default. Committed fixtures, accepted baselines, canonical specs/docs, and explicitly versioned generated mirrors remain at their declared owner paths.
- **Judge the environment before judging the code — a competing hypothesis, not a fallback.** A bug, failed test, error, or odd output is NOT proof of a code defect. Before deep tracing and before any verdict, sweep environment preconditions (toolchain/dependency/lockfile state, stale build or cache artifacts, env vars and config profile, service dependencies up-migrated-seeded, ports/network/clock, OS-path/locale, permissions and locks, leftover processes/containers/test data) AND transient resource pressure (RAM/OOM, CPU saturation under parallel workers, disk/temp exhaustion, handle and connection-pool limits, network flakiness, a timeout that is really slowness). Tell-tale shape: non-deterministic, timing-dependent, passes alone but fails in parallel, fails only on one machine or only on CI, or an error naming resources rather than business rules. Cite the discriminator you ran (clean environment? did code on the failing path change since it last passed? one machine or all? concurrency 1 or a clean rebuild?) — a verdict without one is a guess, for code as much as for the environment. Fix an environment cause in the environment or setup; NEVER edit product code or weaken/skip a test to absorb it, and a failure that vanishes on retry stays unexplained until its mechanism is named. — why: forcing green against an environment fault hides the real defect and permanently rots the test.
- **Cross-platform execution is a required contract.** Before authoring or changing a tool, script, process launcher, path assertion, or filesystem test, name the supported Windows, macOS, and Linux behaviors. Use platform-neutral Node APIs and literal argv vectors; never infer shell, temporary-path, executable-extension, ACL, or symlink semantics from the current host. Canonicalize existing paths before identity, hashing, or equality checks; test native Windows and POSIX seams when behavior differs; keep CI platform matrices authoritative. Preserve fail-closed security boundaries — repair the fixture or platform branch, never weaken the guard just to make one OS green.
- **Keep domain concepts out of generic/shared/infrastructure layers.** Reusable layer (shared library, framework, infra module) must reference NO consumer-specific domain concept — tenant/customer/product IDs, business entities, feature rules. Leak compiles + runs → passes review silently while coupling the "reusable" layer to one consumer. Keep shared type domain-free; push domain fields/logic down into the consumer via subclass/composition. — why: a layer coupled to one consumer's domain is no longer reusable.
