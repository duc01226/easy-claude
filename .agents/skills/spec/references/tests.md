> The `spec` skill (`../SKILL.md`) loads this body for `[mode=tests]`. It is the TC-generation procedure: generate/update test specifications in feature-doc Section 8 using the unified `TC-{FEATURE}-{NNN}` format. The host SKILL.md owns the generic gates (task-tracking, evidence, project-reference docs) and the standalone next-steps tail — this body carries only the mode-specific procedure. For the spec↔test-code reconciliation procedure, see `sync.md` (`[mode=sync]`).

# Mode: Generate / Update Test Specifications (Section 8)

> **Portability:** `docs/specs/` is the fixed Feature Spec root.

**Goal:** Generate/update business test specs in feature docs Section 8 (canonical business TC registry) — unified `TC-{FEATURE}-{NNN}` format. 5 modes: TDD-first, implement-first, update (post-change/PR), sync, from-integration-tests.

**Workflow:** (1) Mode Detection → (2) Investigation → (3) TC Generation → (4) Write Section 8 → (5) Test-Code Sync → (6) Next Steps

**Key Rules:** Unified `TC-{FEATURE}-{NNN}` format · Section 8 = source of truth · Evidence required on every TC · Minimum 5 categories (positive, negative, authorization, edge cases, invariant/property) · Properties not just examples — every [HARD] rule / §5 invariant gets a universally-quantified property TC · Interactive review by asking the user directly mandatory

> **[M5 — Rebuild-from-scratch signal]** A competent team with zero codebase knowledge MUST be able to derive and execute every TC from the spec text alone, on ANY stack — without reading source. If a TC's intent is only understandable by opening the implementation, it fails M5: rewrite the objective/Given-When-Then in business-observable terms. See `.claude/skills/shared/sdd-artifact-contract.md` → "AI-SDD Mandates (M1-M7)" for BLOCKING criteria.

> **[BLOCKING] One TC → many tests (business-oriented TCs):** Each §8 TC is a **business / user-story acceptance scenario**, not a code unit. It is covered by **one OR MANY** annotation-tagged tests (integration + unit, across components/services), joined by the test-spec annotation (key `TestSpec`, value `TC-...`) in the configured test framework's syntax. Write TCs at the business-behavior grain — NEVER split, narrow, or technicalize a TC so it maps 1:1 to a single test method or production class (that breaks the business/user-story orientation, M1/M5). Coverage = ≥1 annotation-tagged test. Many tests sharing one TC is correct, never a duplicate. Canonical contract: `.claude/skills/shared/tc-format.md` → TC ↔ Test Code Cardinality.

> **Graph Context (MANDATORY when graph.db exists):** Before generating test specs for cross-service features, run:
>
> ```bash
> python .claude/scripts/code_graph trace {configured-source-path}/{feature-entry-file} --direction both --json
> ```
>
> Use output to identify: event consumers, message bus subscribers, background jobs triggered by this feature. These are cross-service TC candidates (category 041–049).

## Reference Files (read BEFORE generating TCs)

> **`.claude/skills/spec/references/spec-tests-template.md`** — TC format template: GWT structure, Evidence field, decade-numbering, Preservation Tests section (mandatory for bugfixes). Read before generating any TC.

- `.claude/skills/spec/references/spec-tests-template.md` — TC template format
- `docs/project-reference/domain-entities-reference.md` — Domain entity catalog, relationships, cross-service sync
- `docs/project-reference/integration-test-reference.md` — Integration test patterns, fixture setup, seeder conventions, lessons learned (MUST READ before reviewing/writing integration tests)
- `docs/specs/` — Existing TCs by module — read BEFORE generating to avoid ID collisions

**Workflow:**

1. **Mode Detection** — TDD-first, implement-first, update, sync, or from-integration-tests
2. **Investigation** — Analyze PBI/codebase/existing TCs/git changes per mode
3. **TC Generation** — Generate TC outlines, interactive review with user
4. **Write to Feature Doc** — Upsert TCs into Section 8
5. **Test-Code Sync** — Optionally reconcile Section 8 TCs ↔ executing test code (forward-sync; §8 canonical) — see `sync.md`
6. **Next Steps** — Suggest follow-on actions per mode

**Key Rules:**

- **Unified format:** `TC-{FEATURE}-{NNN}` — feature codes in `docs/project-reference/feature-spec-reference.md`
- **Source of truth:** Feature docs Section 8 — canonical business TC registry. NEVER write standalone TC files to `docs/specs/` as the primary destination; update the governing Feature Spec's Section 8.
- **Evidence required:** Every TC MUST have `Evidence: [Source: {namespace}/{service}/{id}]` (stack-portable abstract anchor — never physical code coordinates or repository-root paths) or `TBD (pre-implementation)` for TDD-first. Canonical format + anchor taxonomy: `shared/tc-format.md`
- **Minimum 5 categories:** Positive (happy path) · Negative (error handling) · **Authorization** (role-based access — MANDATORY) · Edge cases · **Invariant / Property** (MANDATORY — see below)
    - **Invariant / Property TCs (MANDATORY):** For each **[HARD] business rule (§4)** and each **§5 entity invariant**, derive ≥1 **universally-quantified property TC** — phrase the objective/GWT as "for ALL inputs in {domain}, {invariant} holds" — PLUS ≥1 **boundary counter-case** (the input just outside the domain where the invariant must fail-closed). A property TC names the input **domain**, not a single point; this distinguishes it from an example TC (one fixed GIVEN/WHEN/THEN). Walk the 6 invariant classes (idempotency · round-trip/inverse · commutativity · monotonicity · conservation · state-transition) in `.claude/skills/shared/tc-format.md` → "Invariant Categories to Probe" as the discovery prompt. Naming an invariant in the per-TC field is NOT enough — the TC must ASSERT the property across its domain.
    - **Business-visible bugfix specs:** MANDATORY Preservation Tests — see `references/spec-tests-template.md#preservation-tests-mandatory-for-bugfix-specs`
    - **Query-Only exception:** Read-only, no auth boundaries, no events → validation + authorization + edge cases + invariant/property minimum
    - **Config-Only exception:** Flag-toggle features, no entity changes → authorization + edge cases minimum

> **[BLOCKING] Import the Test-Complete Gate.** This mode MUST enforce `.claude/skills/shared/sdd-artifact-contract.md` → **Test-Complete Gate** at the business-visible layer, not just the operation/actor floor below. From that gate: **every user-observable state transition** maps to ≥1 **valid AND ≥1 invalid** transition TC where applicable; **every user-observable external outcome** maps to a demoable TC where applicable; **every test names the business intent or invariant it protects and would fail if that intent breaks**. Architecture-only publish/consume/idempotency obligations belong to the technical spec tree and test code, not to business §8. A spec is NOT test-complete until the business-visible obligations hold — generating only positive/validation/auth example TCs leaves the gate FAILED even when the operation floor passes.
- **Cross-cutting TC categories (when applicable):**
    - **Invariant / Property TCs (MANDATORY):** Per [HARD] §4 rule + §5 invariant — universally-quantified property ("for ALL inputs in {domain}, {invariant} holds") + boundary counter-case; covers business-visible state-transition validity per the imported Test-Complete Gate
    - **Authorization TCs (MANDATORY):** Authorized succeeds, unauthorized rejected, role visibility verified
    - **Seed Data TCs:** Reference data exists, seeder runs correctly
    - **Performance TCs:** Feature within SLA under production-like volume
    - **Data Change TCs:** business data state transforms correctly and remains visible/usable as expected
    - **Preservation TCs (MANDATORY business-visible bugfixes):** ≥1 per "Healthy input" row — authored from OLD code semantics BEFORE fix lands. Technical-only bugfixes with no business-visible result produce zero business TCs.
- **Interactive review:** ALWAYS ask the user directly — review TC list with user before writing
- **Real-world fidelity (per TC):** every TC's `Preconditions` and `Demo Flow` MUST describe a situation real actor behaviour can actually produce. State HOW production reaches the precondition, and — whenever two consecutive steps are distinct actor actions — state the realistic elapsed gap between them. A TC specifying a sequence production could never reach GUARANTEES an unrealistic test downstream: the spec is the upstream lever, so fix it here, never in the generated test's assertions.

<!-- SYNC:real-world-fidelity-testing -->

> **Real-World Fidelity Gate** — MANDATORY when authoring, reviewing, or repairing any integration / E2E / system test.
>
> A test earns trust by reproducing a situation the system can actually meet in production. A scenario that could never occur in real life proves nothing when it passes, and wastes hours when it fails.
>
> 1. **Ask the fidelity question BEFORE writing the setup:** *"Can this sequence, timing, and data actually occur in production?"* If no, the test is mis-specified — fix the SCENARIO, never the assertion.
> 2. **Model real pacing between actor steps.** Two distinct actor actions that production separates by seconds, minutes, or hours MUST NOT be fired back-to-back in the same millisecond. Compressed pacing manufactures races the system was never designed to survive, then reports them as product defects.
> 3. **Wait on a real signal, never a blind sleep.** Find an observable proving the prior step finished — a persisted state change, an audit/version stamp, a queue/worker idle marker, a completion event — and poll until it settles (unchanged across a short stability window). Use a fixed delay ONLY when no observable exists, and say so in a comment.
> 4. **Barriers belong in ARRANGE, never in ASSERT.** Waiting for a precondition is fidelity. Widening an assertion's timeout, loosening a comparison, adding a retry around a failing assertion, or skipping the test is masking. NEVER do the latter to force green.
> 5. **Distinguish harness-amplified from real.** Test topologies (shared infra, fan-out consumers, parallel suites, cold starts) can make a rare production race routine locally. Before filing a product defect, state whether the trigger exists in production and at what likelihood.
> 6. **Keep the protected invariant intact.** Improving fidelity must NEVER reduce what the test protects. If a realistic scenario no longer exercises the rule, the rule needs a DIFFERENT realistic scenario — not a weaker assertion.
> 7. **Deliberate impossible-state tests are allowed, but MUST be labelled.** Corruption-repair, migration, and fail-safe tests intentionally construct states production should never reach; comment WHY the state is reachable (upstream bug, partial write, legacy data), so they are never confused with unrealistic setups.

## Detailed Workflow

### Phase 1: Mode Detection & Context

Detect mode from prompt and context:

| Mode                       | Signal                                            | Action                                                            |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **TDD-first**              | PBI/story exists, code not yet written            | Generate specs from requirements                                  |
| **Implement-first**        | Code already exists, no/incomplete TCs            | Generate specs from codebase analysis                             |
| **Update**                 | Existing TCs + code changes / bugfix / PR         | Diff existing TCs against current code/PR, find gaps, update both |
| **Sync**                   | User says "sync test specs" or bidirectional need | Reconcile feature docs ↔ docs/specs/ (either direction) — see `sync.md` |
| **From-integration-tests** | Tests exist with test spec annotations, no docs   | Extract TC metadata from test code → write to feature docs        |

### Mode Confirmation (ask the user directly)

**[REQUIRED]** Confirm mode before Phase 2 when signals ambiguous:

- Both "update" and "sync" present → which takes priority?
- No mode keyword → TDD-first (new feature) or implement-first (code exists)?
- "from integration tests" → high effort, confirm scope

> "Detected mode: **{detected_mode}** for feature: **{feature_name}**. TCs to write: ~{estimated_count}. Correct?"
>
> Options: [Yes, proceed] [Change mode] [Change scope]

Skip confirmation only when mode explicit in `$ARGUMENTS` AND feature name unambiguous.

**Must read FIRST:**

1. `docs/project-reference/feature-spec-reference.md` — correct `{FEATURE}` code for TC IDs
2. Target feature doc — Section 8 exists? Read existing TCs to avoid ID collisions
3. `.claude/skills/shared/sdd-artifact-contract.md` — "Test-Complete Gate" (TC coverage mapping: minimum categories — positive / negative / unauthorized-access / state-transition / event — and depth). `docs/project-reference/spec-principles.md` adds only repo-local test-mapping conventions (§5).

**Spec Readiness Gate (BLOCKING — implement-first and update modes only):**

Read target feature doc Sections 3, 4, 5, 7. Check:

- Every BR-XX in Section 4 has `[Source: {namespace}/{service}/{id}]` abstract-anchor citation — flag missing
- Every US-/AC- in Section 3 references ≥1 `BR-XX` — flag unreferenced user stories
- Section 7 has permission matrix (≥1 role × action row) — flag if absent
- Section 3 has US-/AC- entries with explicit outcomes — flag if empty/vague

If 2+ fail → ask the user directly: "Spec readiness below TC generation threshold. Fill gaps first OR proceed with shallow TCs (`Status: Planned`)?" NEVER silently generate shallow TCs.

**If target feature doc missing:** suggest `$spec` first, OR create minimal Section 8 stub.

### Phase 2: Investigation

**TDD-first mode:**

1. Read PBI/story from `team-artifacts/pbis/` or user-provided
2. Extract acceptance criteria
3. Identify TC categories: CRUD, validation, **authorization** (mandatory), workflows, edge cases, seed data, performance, data migration
4. Cross-reference existing feature doc requirements (Sections 1-7)
5. PBI Authorization section → generate authorization TCs (unauthorized rejection per role)
6. PBI Seed Data section → generate seed data TCs if reference/config data needed
7. PBI Data Migration section → generate migration TCs if schema changes exist

**Implement-first mode:**

**[BLOCKING]:** Enumerate ALL operations first — establishes **what the feature does**, so no capability is missed. ⚠️ **It does NOT establish the TC floor.** The floor is `business_floor` (see `author.md` — *"The business TC floor"*), which reads only spec sections.

**Operation discovery (implement-first) — informs WHAT to write about, never HOW MANY:**

```bash
# First resolve {target-source-path} and source file globs from docs/project-config.json
# and the project reference docs named by docs/project-reference/docs-index-reference.md.
# Write-side handlers/operations
rg "{project write-handler patterns}" {target-source-path} -g "{source-file-glob}" -l
# Write-side mutating endpoints/actions
rg "{project mutating-endpoint patterns}" {target-source-path} -g "{source-file-glob}" -l
# Event consumers / background jobs / async processors
rg "{project event-or-background-job patterns}" {target-source-path} -g "{source-file-glob}" -l
# Read-side handlers/operations
rg "{project read-handler patterns}" {target-source-path} -g "{source-file-glob}" -l
# Read-side query endpoints/actions
rg "{project read-endpoint patterns}" {target-source-path} -g "{source-file-glob}" -l
```

Use the discovered operations to check that **no business capability was missed** when authoring §3 journeys — then set the count from `business_floor`.

⚠️ **[HARD] The operation count is NOT the TC floor.** `business_floor` is (`author.md` — *"The business TC floor"*). An operation that produces **no user-observable behavior and no business data-state change** gets **no business TC** — it is covered by the technical spec tree. Consumers, event handlers, sync processors and background jobs are architecture; a business TC exists only where a user or QC can **demo** the outcome.

If `business_floor` > 20: split into operation-group batches (≤20 ops each per task tracking). NEVER generate all TCs in one pass for large features.

**Actor Catalog Discovery — §2-AUTHORING ONLY (never a TC-count input):**

⚠️ **[HARD] These greps discover candidate roles to write into §2 as business nouns. Once §2 exists, §2 is the ONLY source.** `count(§2 actors)` MUST read §2's actor list — never a permission-guard grep. A permission attribute is an *implementation* of a role; sourcing the count from it lets an authorization refactor move a "business" floor with zero business change.

```bash
# Permission attributes and role guards
rg "{project authorization/permission guard patterns}" {target-source-path} -g "{source-file-glob}" -n | head -30
# Role/permission enums
rg "{project actor/role/permission definition patterns}" {target-source-path} -g "{source-file-glob}" -n | head -20
```

Build actor catalog into **§2**: `[Role1, Role2,...]`. Authorization TC minimum = **`count(§2 actors) × 2`** (authorized succeeds + unauthorized rejected) — **read from §2, not from the grep above**. Every §2 actor MUST appear in ≥1 authorization TC.

1. Grep commands/queries using project patterns from `docs/project-config.json` and the referenced architecture/test docs.
2. Grep entities and domain events
3. **Trace the full vertical chain, not just the backend slice:** UI view + action → API/route → command/query handler → entity + business rule → persistence → event → consumer/read model → UI observable outcome. Reuse the Full-Chain Trace Map authored by `spec [mode=init]` (`.ai/workspace/analysis/{Module}-chain-map.md`, Step 1-INIT.4.6) when it exists; otherwise build the chain with `graph-connect-api` (frontend→backend links) + `graph-trace` (backend→entity→event). A TC that asserts only a handler in isolation misses the seam behavior the chain reveals.
4. Identify testable behaviors from implementation — at least one **end-to-end chain TC** (decade 061–069, UI/User-journey) per `COMPLETE` chain that spans intent → outcome across the full slice, in addition to the per-operation TCs

**Update mode (post-change / post-bugfix / post-PR):**

**[BLOCKING] FIRST — the business-visibility gate. Answer before writing ANY TC:**

> **Did this change alter what a user or QC can observe, demo, or rely on?**
>
> - **NO → the correct output is ZERO new business TCs.** Say so explicitly and stop. A no-op is the **expected, correct** result for a technical fix — it is **never** a coverage failure and MUST NOT be recorded as a gap.
> - **YES → author TC(s) for the observable business behavior**, in demo form (actor → flow → observable expectation).
>
> **TECHNICAL-ONLY (→ zero business TCs; route to the technical spec tree):** a consumer/event-handler/sync-processor not firing; a read-model or projection lag; a serialization, mapping, or round-trip persistence defect; a null-reference/exception; a query/index performance fix; a race or idempotency defect; a DI/config/migration error; a retry/timeout; a UI rendering, CSS, layout, or overflow defect; a data-load or pagination mechanic — **where the business rule, the user-visible outcome, and the business data state are all unchanged**.
>
> ⚠️ **The test is NOT "can I phrase this without technical words?"** Any technical case can be laundered into tech-free prose — *"the system correctly synchronizes the record"* is a technical TC in a business costume, and it is exactly the failure this gate exists to stop. **The test is: can a QC engineer DEMO this as a business outcome, and would a stakeholder recognize the value?** If the only way to observe it is to inspect a queue, a projection, a log, or a database row that no user-facing behavior depends on — **it is TECHNICAL-ONLY.**
>
> **The honest question is "what business behavior broke?", not "what code changed?"** Most bugfixes change code without changing business behavior. When the pre-fix and post-fix **business** behavior are identical — the feature was always *supposed* to work this way and now does — **there is no new business rule to specify, and no business TC to add.** The regression belongs in an integration test, which is where regression protection lives.

> ### The constructive form of the gate — write the TC as a DEMO SCRIPT
>
> The gate above says what a business TC must **not** be. This says what it must **be** — and it is the stronger
> target, because *"is it demoable?"* is answerable by **writing the demo** and far more checkable than *"is it
> technical?"*.
>
> **A §8 business TC and a `$demo-guide` case describe THE SAME EVENT** — one case, two audiences: the spec states
> it as intent, the demo guide stages it for an audience. **They MUST be able to converge**, and that is a
> **usable authoring test**: *if `$demo-guide` could not turn this TC into a live demo someone would sit through,
> it is not a business TC.* ⚠️ Conversely, a TC that reads as a demo script **cannot** be a laundered technical
> case — a presenter has nothing to show for *"the consumer receives the event"*.
>
> Author every TC in the template's demo shape (`spec-tests-template.md`): **actor → demo flow → expected result**,
> filling every applicable dimension — **UI**, **system behavior**, **business data state** (in business language,
> never storage language), and **data shown on the UI**. Omit a dimension only **with a reason, never silently**.
> **`$demo-guide` reads §8 as its canonical source of user stories and TC IDs** — so a §8 TC that is not
> demo-shaped surfaces later as a case the demo guide cannot stage.

**[BLOCKING] THEN:** run the operation discovery below **only to locate the changed capability** — never to count TCs. Check existing TC count in Section 8 against `business_floor`.

```bash
# Write-side
rg "{project write-handler patterns}" {target-source-path} -g "{source-file-glob}" -l
rg "{project mutating-endpoint patterns}" {target-source-path} -g "{source-file-glob}" -l
rg "{project event-or-background-job patterns}" {target-source-path} -g "{source-file-glob}" -l
# Read-side
rg "{project read-handler patterns}" {target-source-path} -g "{source-file-glob}" -l
rg "{project read-endpoint patterns}" {target-source-path} -g "{source-file-glob}" -l
```

- **The floor is `business_floor`** (`author.md` — *"The business TC floor"*). **NEVER derive a floor from the operation count.** An operation-derived floor is architecture-derived: it mints a business TC for every consumer, event handler, and background job, and it moves when the code is re-architected though no business behavior changed.
- Existing TC count < `business_floor` → a **business** coverage gap (a user story, `[HARD]` rule, invariant, transition, actor, or observable state with no TC). Flag: `"Pre-existing gap: {existing}/{business_floor} TCs"` and fill it with **business** TCs.
- ⚠️ **A spec is NOT under-covered because it has fewer TCs than the module has handlers.** That comparison is the defect: it reads an architecture count as a business obligation and backfills technical TCs into a business spec on every bugfix. **If `business_floor` is met, there is no gap — regardless of the operation count.**
- **Scope discipline:** update-triggered TCs cover the observable business change. Backfill **only** genuine `business_floor` gaps — never architecture-derived ones.

1. Read existing Section 8 TCs
2. `git diff` or `git diff main...HEAD` (for PRs) — find code changes since last TC update
3. Identify: new commands/queries not covered, changed behaviors, removed features
4. Bugfixes: add regression TC (e.g., `TC-ORD-040: Regression — order total calculation bypass`)
5. Generate gap analysis

> **Checkpoint:** Answer this question before proceeding: "Is the code change intentional and approved?" If yes, update TCs. If no (regression), the code needs fixing — do not update TCs to document broken behavior.

6. Update feature docs Section 8 (canonical), then forward-sync to executing test code via `[mode=sync]`

#### Step UPDATE-FINAL: TC Blast Radius Analysis (UPDATE mode only)

> **[RECOMMENDED]** After updating TCs for the target feature, scan for other features whose TCs
> may be invalidated by the same code change.

**Run these greps against `docs/specs/`:**

```bash
# 1. Find API endpoint references in other feature docs
grep -rl "{endpoint}" docs/specs/ | grep -v "{current-module}"
# Replace {endpoint} with the main API path changed (e.g., /api/orders, /api/customers)

# 2. Find entity references in other feature docs
grep -rl "{entity-name}" docs/specs/ | grep -v "{current-module}"
# Replace {entity-name} with key domain entities changed (e.g., Order, Customer)

# 3. Find event references in other feature docs
grep -rl "{event-name}" docs/specs/ | grep -v "{current-module}"
# Replace {event-name} with events fired by the changed code
```

**Output:** List of potentially affected feature docs. For each hit:

1. Check if the referenced TC (Section 8) still describes valid behavior
2. If TC is stale → add to the UPDATE mode summary as "POTENTIALLY STALE: TC-{FEATURE}-{NNN} in {other-module} — review recommended"
3. Leave those TCs for the owner of that feature doc to update — never auto-update them yourself

**Summary format for watzup/session end:**

```
TC Blast Radius Analysis:
- Changed: {current-feature} ({N} TCs updated)
- Potentially affected: {module-A} (references {entity/endpoint})
- Potentially affected: {module-B} (references {entity/endpoint})
- Action needed: Review TCs in affected modules before next release
```

**Skip when:**

- Change is UI-only (no API, entity, or event changes)
- Change is additive only (new endpoint added, no existing endpoint modified)
- Module has no dependency surface (standalone, no shared entities)

**Sync mode (§8 TCs ↔ test code):** the full reconciliation procedure lives in `sync.md` (`[mode=sync]`). High-level shape:

1. Read feature docs Section 8 TCs for target module (canonical source)
2. Read test files: grep for the test-spec annotation (key `TestSpec`) across configured executing test tiers; include integration, unit, E2E, contract, and property-test suites that carry the annotation.
3. Build a 2-way comparison table:

```
| TC ID | In §8 (Feature Doc)? | In Test Code? | Action Needed |
|-------|----------------------|---------------|---------------|
| TC-FEAT-001 | ✅ | ✅ | None |
| TC-FEAT-025 | ✅ | ❌ | Generate test via $integration-test |
| TC-FEAT-030 | ❌ | ✅ | Back-fill §8 TC (from-integration-tests mode) |
```

4. Reconcile: a §8 TC with no covering test → flag for the owning test route; an existing business `TestSpec` with no §8 TC → adjudicate via M7 before back-filling; technical-only tests use `TechnicalSpec` and do not create §8 TCs
5. Section 8 remains source of truth — any conflict uses the §8 version

**From-integration-tests mode (reverse-engineer specs from existing tests):**

1. Grep for the test-spec annotation (key `TestSpec`) in the target test project
2. Per test method: extract TC ID, method name, test description from comments
3. Read test method body → generate GWT steps and evidence
4. Write extracted TCs to feature doc Section 8 (if not already there)
5. Useful when: tests written before spec system existed, or imported from another project

### TC Completeness Gate (BLOCKING — runs before Phase 3)

**[BLOCKING]** Do NOT start Phase 3 until all rows in this table show PASS:

| Gate                | Check                                                         | Required                                       | Actual | Status    |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------ | --------- |
| Story coverage      | TC count for §3 user stories                                  | ≥ count(§3 US × AC)                            | {n}    | PASS/FAIL |
| Permission coverage | TC count for authorization                                    | ≥ count(§2 actors) × 2                         | {n}    | PASS/FAIL |
| State coverage      | TC count for observable §6 states                             | ≥ count(observable §6 states)                  | {n}    | PASS/FAIL |
| Invariant coverage  | **Property TC** count guarding §4 [HARD] rules + §5 invariants | ≥ count([HARD] BR) + count(§5 entity invariants) | {n}    | PASS/FAIL |
| Transition coverage | Valid + invalid transition TCs for each §5 lifecycle state     | ≥ 2 per stateful entity (≥1 valid, ≥1 invalid) | {n}    | PASS/FAIL |
| Chain coverage      | End-to-end chain TC (decade 061–069) per `COMPLETE` user-facing chain (Full-Chain Trace Map) | ≥ 1 per COMPLETE UI-bearing chain | {n} | PASS/FAIL |
| Scenario fidelity   | TCs whose Preconditions + step pacing production can actually reach | ALL planned TCs (0 unreachable; a deliberate impossible-state TC counts only when labelled) | {n} | PASS/FAIL |
| Total floor         | Total planned TCs                                             | ≥ `business_floor`                             | {n}    | PASS/FAIL |

> ⚠️ **This table has NO Write-op / Read-op / Event-job rows, deliberately.** Those made the business TC count a function of the architecture — an Event/job row mints a business TC for every consumer and background job, which is how sync/consumer/event-handler cases entered a tech-free business spec. **The obligation is not abolished: it is owned by the technical spec tree**, where counting handlers is correct. Every row above reads a **spec section**, so re-architecting cannot move any number in this table.
>
> **Count properties, not operations.** The Invariant-coverage row counts TCs that ASSERT a universally-quantified property (per the imported Test-Complete Gate), NOT TCs that merely name an invariant in the per-TC field. A §4 [HARD] rule or §5 invariant with zero property TC = FAIL even when every story/actor row passes. The Transition-coverage row operationalizes `sdd-artifact-contract.md` → Test-Complete Gate ("every state transition maps to ≥1 valid AND ≥1 invalid transition TC"); also confirm every integration event has an idempotency TC (covered under Event/job coverage).

**FAIL action:** task tracking for each FAIL row — list specific missing TC categories (and, for Invariant/Transition rows, the exact §4 rule / §5 invariant / lifecycle state left uncovered). NEVER proceed to Phase 3 until all gates PASS.

**Operation group decomposition:** If `business_floor` > 20, split TC generation into batches of ≤20 related operations:

```
Task tracking: "Generate CRUD TCs for {feature} — ops {1-N}: {CommandA}, {CommandB}, {CommandC}"
Task tracking: "Generate Read TCs for {feature} — ops {1-M}: {QueryA}, {QueryB}"
Task tracking: "Generate Event TCs for {feature} — ops {1-K}: {EventConsumerA}, {BackgroundJobA}"
Task tracking: "Generate Permission TCs for {feature} — actors: {Role1}, {Role2}"
Task tracking: "Generate Edge Case TCs for {feature} — boundary conditions from §4 [HARD] rules + §5 invariants"
Task tracking: "Generate Invariant/Property TCs for {feature} — per [HARD] §4 rule + §5 invariant: universally-quantified property + boundary counter-case (probe idempotency/round-trip/commutativity/monotonicity/conservation/state-transition)"
```

Each batch task completes before starting the next. Final ask the user directly review covers all batches together.

### Phase 3: TC Generation with Interactive Review

1. Generate TC outlines as a summary table:

```
| TC ID | Name | Priority | Category | Status |
|-------|------|----------|----------|--------|
| TC-ORD-037 | Create order with multiple line items | P0 | CRUD | New |
| TC-ORD-038 | Reject order without required fields | P1 | Validation | New |
| TC-ORD-039 | Unauthenticated user cannot access orders | P0 | Permission | New |
```

2. Use ask the user directly to review with user:

```
Question: "These {N} test cases cover {feature}. Review the list:
[Coverage context (diagnostic only — NOT a gate, and NOT a floor): business_floor = {business_floor} from {us_ac} US×AC + {hard_rule_count} [HARD] rules + {invariant_count} §5 invariants + {transition_count} transitions×2 + {actor_count} §2 actors×2 + {state_count} observable §6 states. {N} TCs planned. Operation discovery found {total_ops} operations — shown ONLY to check no capability was missed; it is NOT a target and a lower TC count is NOT a gap.]"
Options:
- "Approve as-is (Recommended)" — Proceed to writing
- "Add missing scenario" — Describe what's missing
- "Adjust priorities" — Change P0/P1/P2 assignments
- "Regenerate" — Re-analyze and try again
```

**Coverage context calculation:** `coverage_pct = (N / total_ops) × 100`. Treat this as a **diagnostic, not a quality gate** — do NOT gate approval on hitting any line-/operation-coverage percentage. **Low coverage is a useful negative signal:** a low `coverage_pct` flags an under-probed area worth investigating (`ℹ️ {coverage_pct}% operation coverage — likely untested operations; list which ops have zero TCs`). **High coverage is NOT a quality signal:** a high `coverage_pct` can still leave every [HARD] rule / §5 invariant unguarded, so it never implies the spec is test-complete. The real gates are the **Invariant-coverage and Transition-coverage rows** above (does each property hold across its domain?), not the operation-coverage percentage.

3. Iterate until user approves.

### Phase 4: Write to Feature Doc Section 8

**Canonical write — feature docs own TCs. NEVER overwrite existing TCs.**

1. Locate Section 8 in target feature doc
2. Section 8 exists: append new TCs after existing, preserve existing TC IDs
3. Section 8 absent: create from template
4. Use `Edit` tool to upsert

**TC format** — **ILLUSTRATIVE ONLY. The canonical definition is `.claude/skills/shared/tc-format.md` → TC Entry Format.**

> **[HARD] This block does NOT define the format; it only shows it.** If this excerpt and `tc-format.md` ever
> disagree, **`tc-format.md` wins and this excerpt is the bug.** Never author a TC from this copy without checking
> the canonical file — a format duplicated in N places drifts in N-1 of them, and it drifts silently because
> nothing reads two files at once. *(This excerpt had already drifted: it taught `Test Steps` for a full version
> after the canonical format moved to `Demo Flow` + `Expected Result`.)*

```markdown
#### TC-{FEATURE}-{NNN}: {Descriptive Test Name} [{Priority}]

**Objective:** {What this test verifies}

**Business Intent / Invariant Guarded:** {Business rule or invariant this TC protects; the TC must fail if this rule breaks}

**Preconditions:**

- {State a user or QC could arrange — never storage setup}

**Real-World Reachability:** {how production actually reaches those Preconditions — which actor performs which prior action, in what order, and the realistic elapsed gap between consecutive actor actions}

**Demo Flow:**
\`\`\`gherkin
Given {state a user could arrange}
And {additional context}
When {an action a user could take}
Then {an outcome a user could SEE}
And {additional visible verification}
\`\`\`

**Expected Result:**

| Dimension | What to state |
| --- | --- |
| **UI** | What the user sees on screen |
| **System behavior** | What the system does, in business terms |
| **Business data state** | What is now true about the business — business language, never storage language |
| **Data shown on UI** | What the user reads back, and where |

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- ✅ {Success behavior}
- ❌ {Failure behavior}

**Test Data:**
\`\`\`json
{ "field": "value" }
\`\`\`

> For a TC guarding a [HARD] §4 rule or §5 invariant, use the **Property TC** variant instead of a single example — the structured `inputDomain` / `invariant` / `boundaryCounterCase` generator-spec block (canonical: `.claude/skills/shared/tc-format.md` → TC Entry Format → "Property TC"). The property's universality must be machine-readable in those three fields, not buried in prose.

**Edge Cases:**

- {Boundary condition}

**Evidence:** `[Source: {namespace}/{service}/{id}]` or `TBD (pre-implementation)`
```

> **[M1-M2 Compliance — authoring the TC body]** The `Objective`, `Business Intent / Invariant Guarded`, and the `Given/When/Then` steps MUST name business operations and observable states only — what an actor does and what the system visibly does in response. NEVER use class/method/file names, transport/handler names, or language-native types in these fields. Those source identifiers belong ONLY in the `**Evidence**` and `CoveredBy` carriers. Quick check: replace the implementation with a different stack — does the GWT still read correctly? If not, it leaks tech (M1/M2 fail). See `.claude/skills/shared/sdd-artifact-contract.md` → "AI-SDD Mandates (M1-M7)" for BLOCKING criteria.

> **[M7 — Business-visibility — judge the TC BODY]** Apply the demo test to the case BODY: *"what would a stakeholder SEE change?"* — no answer → FAIL as TECHNICAL-ONLY, and the case does NOT belong in §8. A `When` that is an invocation (a handler runs, a consumer receives, a job fires, data syncs) or a `Then` asserting schema/type/nullability/call-count FAILS. Judge the BODY, never the title or ID — a business-sounding title routinely fronts an invocation-shaped `When`.
>
> **M1 governs vocabulary; M7 governs subject matter.** A technical case in impeccably tech-free prose satisfies M1 while violating M7 — *"the system correctly synchronizes the record"* names no technology, passes the M1-M2 check above, and is still a technical TC wearing a business costume. The M1-M2 stack-swap check CANNOT catch this; only the demo test can. See `.claude/skills/shared/sdd-artifact-contract.md` → "Business-Visibility Gate" for the full BLOCKING criteria, the detection recipe, and the no-op rule (a change with no business-behavior delta correctly yields ZERO new TCs).
>
> ⚠️ **Business-visible ≠ UI-demoable — do NOT conflate the two gates.** A genuinely business-visible outcome a stakeholder would recognize, but observable only through a **non-UI surface** (API response, CLI output, or the business state a job produces — observed by an actor, NEVER the job firing itself, which M7's invocation-`When` rule above still FAILS), **PASSES M7 and belongs in §8**. `$demo-guide` files such a case in its closing `Appendix — Technical demo (non-UI)`; that placement is a **demo-channel** decision, NEVER an M7 verdict, and its "technical" label does NOT mean TECHNICAL-ONLY here. Only a case with **no observable business outcome at all** is the M7 violation. Counterpart of `.claude/skills/demo-guide/SKILL.md:292` (§ *Integration with Other Skills* → `$spec`). — why: the two skills are wired together by name (`$demo-guide` reads §8 as its canonical source, below) and share the word "technical" for opposite verdicts; a spec author who reads demo-guide's appendix label as an M7 finding deletes valid business TCs.

> **[BLOCKING] Real-world fidelity — judge the SCENARIO the TC specifies.** Per the Real-World Fidelity Gate above, a TC is the upstream lever on test realism: a spec describing an impossible situation guarantees an unrealistic test, and that test proves nothing when it passes. Before writing any TC body, answer: *"Can this sequence, timing, and data actually occur in production?"*
>
> 1. **`Real-World Reachability` is REQUIRED on every TC** — name the prior actor action(s) that produce the `Preconditions`. "The data is simply there" is not reachability; if no actor path produces that state, the TC is mis-specified — re-scope it, never soften the `Then`.
> 2. **State the gap whenever consecutive steps are distinct actor actions.** A TC whose `When`/`And` steps imply two different actor actions with NO realistic gap MUST declare the gap explicitly (*"the reviewer responds minutes after the applicant submits"*) or be re-scoped into separate TCs. Silence here becomes a back-to-back call in the generated test, manufacturing a race production never has.
> 3. **A deliberately unreachable state MUST be labelled** with WHY it is reachable (upstream defect, partial write, legacy data) — see the template's `Deliberate Impossible State` field. Unlabelled, it is indistinguishable from a mis-specified TC.
> 4. **Fidelity NEVER costs coverage.** If a realistic scenario stops exercising the [HARD] rule or §5 invariant the TC guards, author a DIFFERENT realistic scenario — never a weaker `Then`.
>
> Full field definitions: `references/spec-tests-template.md` → Individual TC Entry.

**Evidence rules by mode:**

- **TDD-first:** `Evidence: TBD (pre-implementation)` — will be updated after implementation
- **Implement-first:** trace to the real code, then record the stack-portable abstract anchor `Evidence: [Source: {namespace}/{service}/{id}]` (derive namespace/service/id per `shared/tc-format.md`; the physical `file:line` goes to the provenance sidecar, NEVER into the doc)
- **Update:** re-resolve the anchor ONLY if the logical artifact was renamed/split; a file move or stack change does NOT change the anchor — that stability is the point

> **[M3 Traceability — logical-IDs-first]** Every TC MUST map to at least one logical business-rule/operation ID (`BR-`/`OP-` from feature doc Section 6/8) as its primary trace spine — record this mapping in the TC body (e.g. a `Traces: BR-XX, OP-XX` line) SEPARATE from the evidence anchor. The `[Source: {namespace}/{service}/{id}]` in the `**Evidence**` field is the SECONDARY, stack-portable carrier — it names WHICH logical artifact implements/verifies the behavior, never WHAT the TC guards. KEEP the abstract anchor; never drop it and never replace it with `file:line` (physical coordinates live only in the provenance sidecar). A TC with `[Source: ...]` but no logical-ID mapping fails M3. See `.claude/skills/shared/sdd-artifact-contract.md` → "AI-SDD Mandates (M1-M7)" for BLOCKING criteria.

### Phase 5: Sync Section 8 TCs ↔ Integration Test Code (Optional)

The full reconciliation procedure (direction detection, quality gate, forward/reverse algorithms, orphan detection, staleness tracking) lives in `sync.md` (`[mode=sync]`). At a glance, the forward shape (§8 is canonical; test code implements it):

1. Map each §8 TC to its covering test method(s) via the test-spec annotation (key `TestSpec`, value `TC-…`) — **one TC may be covered by many tests** (integration + unit, across components/services); the annotation is the join key, and finding ≥1 covering test means the TC is covered (see `tc-format.md` → TC ↔ Test Code Cardinality)
2. TDD-first: map to expected test method names (to be created by `$integration-test`)
3. Flag §8 TCs with **zero** covering tests as coverage gaps for `$integration-test` (NEVER flag many-tests-per-TC as a problem — that is the expected one-to-many shape; NEVER split a business TC to achieve a 1:1 map to test methods)

> **[M2/M3 — keep §8 stack-portable]** Each TC's `Evidence` **abstract anchor** (`[Source: {namespace}/{service}/{id}]`) stays verbatim — NEVER expand it to physical code coordinates or repository-root paths. The only physical reference a TC may carry is the operational `CoveredBy` field — one or more `{TestFile}::{MethodName}` link(s), a test-filter expression, or manual-QC coverage, since a business TC maps to many tests. Legacy `IntegrationTest:` is accepted only as migration input.

**Skip** if user says "skip sync" or no integration test project exists for the module. For the full algorithm, switch to `[mode=sync]` (`sync.md`).

### Phase 6: Next Step Suggestion

Based on mode, suggest by asking the user directly:

**TDD-first:**

```
1. "$artifact-review --type=spec-tests — Validate TC quality before generating tests (Recommended)"
2. "$integration-test — Generate test stubs from these TCs (skip review)"
3. "$plan — Plan the feature implementation"
4. "Done for now — I'll implement later"
```

**Implement-first:**

```
1. "$artifact-review --type=spec-tests — Validate TC quality before generating tests (Recommended)"
2. "$integration-test — Generate integration tests (skip review)"
3. "$workflow-review-changes — Review all changes"
4. "Done for now"
```

**Update (post-change/PR):**

```
1. "$artifact-review --type=spec-tests — Validate updated TCs before regenerating tests (Recommended)"
2. "$integration-test — Generate/update tests for changed TCs (skip review)"
3. "$test — Run existing tests to verify coverage"
4. "spec [mode=sync] — Sync §8 TCs ↔ executing test code"
5. "Done for now"
```

**Sync:**

```
1. "spec [mode=sync] — Sync §8 TCs ↔ executing test code after reconciliation (Recommended)"
2. "$integration-test — Generate tests for any TCs missing test coverage"
3. "Done for now"
```

**From-integration-tests:**

```
1. "spec [mode=sync] — Sync §8 TCs ↔ executing test code for newly documented TCs (Recommended)"
2. "$test — Run tests to verify all documented TCs pass"
3. "Done for now"
```

**Collision prevention:**

1. Grep the feature doc for `TC-{FEATURE}-` to list all existing IDs
2. Find the highest NNN in the target decade → assign next sequential
3. If a decade is full (9 entries), use the next available decade in the same category grouping
4. Assign only fresh, never-before-used TC IDs — never reuse a deprecated ID

## TC Deprecation Protocol

When feature behavior removed or significantly changed:

1. **NEVER delete TC** — preserve audit trail and git blame
2. Append `[DEPRECATED: {YYYY-MM-DD} — {reason}]` to title
3. Change `**Status:**` → `Deprecated`
4. Test code: add `[Obsolete("TC deprecated: {reason}")]` attribute and skip test
5. Forward sync (`spec [mode=sync]`) auto-handles deprecated TCs in Section 8

**Example:**

```
#### TC-USR-021: User Can View Profile [P1] [DEPRECATED: 2026-04-21 — Field removed per privacy policy]
**Status:** Deprecated
```

---

## Anti-Patterns

- ❌ Writing TCs to `docs/specs/` as the primary destination (use feature docs Section 8)
- ❌ Using `TC-{SVC}-{NNN}` or `TC-{SVC}-{FEATURE}-{NNN}` format (use unified `TC-{FEATURE}-{NNN}`)
- ❌ Generating TCs without reading existing Section 8 (causes ID collisions)
- ❌ Skipping the interactive review step (user must approve TC list)
- ❌ Writing TCs without Evidence field (every TC needs it, even if `TBD`)
- ❌ Specifying a scenario production could never reach — unreachable `Preconditions`, or two distinct actor actions with no realistic gap (mis-specified TC → unrealistic test → false defect report)

## See Also

- `artifact-review --type=spec-tests` — TC quality review (use AFTER this mode to validate TC coverage and correctness)
- `spec [mode=sync]` — Native sync mode (forward-syncs Section 8 TCs ↔ executing test code; see `sync.md`)
- `integration-test` — Integration test code generator (use AFTER this mode to generate test stubs)
- `$spec` — Feature doc creator (creates the Section 8 that this mode populates)
- `refine` — PBI refinement (feeds acceptance criteria into this mode's TDD-first path)

## Integration with Bugfix Flow

When `spec [mode=tests]` is called in **REGRESSION mode** (bugfix workflow):

1. Run **Spec-Wrong? Gate** FIRST (same logic as UPDATE mode)
2. If spec was wrong → run `$spec [update]` (fix the canonical spec) BEFORE writing regression TCs
3. If code was wrong → write regression TC describing correct (expected) behavior, then proceed to fix
4. Regression TCs describe the CORRECT behavior, not the broken behavior

**Anti-pattern to avoid:**

```
# WRONG: Documenting the bug as expected behavior
TC-REG-001: GIVEN payment processed WHEN amount > limit THEN allow (← this was the bug)

# RIGHT: Documenting the fix as expected behavior
TC-REG-001: GIVEN payment processed WHEN amount > limit THEN reject with PaymentLimitExceededException
```
