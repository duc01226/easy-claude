## Codex Project-Reference Loading (No Hooks)

Codex uses static project-reference loading instead of runtime-injected project docs.
When coding, planning, debugging, testing, or reviewing, open project docs explicitly using this routing.

**Always read:**
- `docs/project-config.json` (project-specific paths, commands, modules, and workflow/test settings)
- `docs/project-reference/docs-index-reference.md` (routes to the full `docs/project-reference/*` catalog)
- `docs/project-reference/lessons.md` (always-on guardrails and anti-patterns)

**Missing/stale context route:** If `docs/project-config.json`, the docs index, `lessons.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, or any task-required reference doc is missing or stale, auto-run `$project-init` or the narrow setup route (`$project-config`, `$docs-init`, `$scan-all`, `$scan --target=<key>`, `$claude-md-init`) before ordinary project-specific work. If Codex mirrors or `AGENTS.md` are missing/stale, ask the user to run `$sync-codex`; do not auto-run it.

**Situation-based docs:**
- Backend/CQRS/API/domain/entity changes: `backend-patterns-reference.md`, `domain-entities-reference.md`, `project-structure-reference.md`
- Frontend/UI/styling/design-system: `frontend-patterns-reference.md`, `scss-styling-guide.md`, `design-system/README.md`
- Spec authoring, `docs/specs/` pathing, or TC format: `feature-spec-reference.md`, `spec-system-reference.md`, `spec-principles.md`
- Behavior/public-contract changes or spec-test-code sync: `workflow-spec-test-code-cycle-reference.md` plus the spec docs above
- Derived spec indexes/ERDs/reimplementation guides: `spec-system-reference.md` and source Feature Specs under `docs/specs/`
- Integration test implementation/review: `integration-test-reference.md`
- E2E test implementation/review: `e2e-test-reference.md`
- Code review/audit work: `code-review-rules.md` plus domain docs above based on changed files

Do not read all docs blindly. Start from `docs-index-reference.md`, then open only relevant files for the task.

## Quick Summary

> **Portability:** `docs/specs/` is the fixed Feature Spec root. `docs/templates/detailed-feature-spec-template.md` remains the default template unless `workflowPatterns.featureDocTemplate` points to another template.

**[IMPORTANT] task tracking** — Break ALL work into small tasks BEFORE starting. For simple tasks, ask user whether to skip.

**Goal:** Own the entire Feature Spec lifecycle in one skill — author/maintain tech-free 8-section business Feature Specs (code evidence carried only in Section 8 test-case anchors, never prose), generate Section 8 test specifications, and reconcile those TCs with integration test code — producing a tech-free, AI-implementable Feature Spec whose Section 8 TC registry stays the single source of truth, traceable to integration test code, so any team can rebuild the feature on any stack from the spec alone. The mode you run determines which `references/` body drives work; the shared §8 contract, M1-M6 mandates, and quality philosophy below apply every mode.

**Summary:**

- Resolve the mode FIRST (draft/init/update/audit/amend/tests/sync) — an explicit `[mode=<x>]` wins, else infer from request + repo state; when ambiguous ask via a direct user question before any mutating mode, then read the matching `references/{author,tests,sync}.md` body and never run a mode from memory.
- §1-7 prose is STRICTLY tech-free (no framework/product/language/persistence/auth names per `spec-principles.md` §3.2); technical identifiers live ONLY in evidence carriers — Section 8 is the canonical TC registry (`TC-{FEATURE}-{NNN}`) and must never be overwritten during `update`.
- Every TC carries verifiable `[Source: namespace/service/id]` evidence — the sole exception is `mode=draft`, where idea-sourced specs use `Evidence: TBD` + provisional flag, upgraded to real anchors on the first code-sourced run.
- Honor the M1-M6 mandates (`sdd-artifact-contract.md`) and canonical TC format (`shared/tc-format.md`); `INDEX.md`/ERD are derived artifacts — flag refresh need in `update` but never trigger `$spec-index` here.

> **Renamed:** formerly `/feature-spec` (and earlier `/feature-docs`); the former `/spec-tests` skill is now folded in as `mode=tests` / `mode=sync`. Those names no longer resolve as slash commands — use `$spec` with the matching mode.

### Modes (resolve mode FIRST — BLOCKING)

| Mode     | Use when…                                                          | Body            |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------- |
| `draft`  | Author a provisional spec from an idea/requirement/prompt — **no code yet** (TDD-first, §8 `Evidence: TBD`, provisional marker) | `references/author.md` |
| `init`   | No `docs/specs/{Bucket}/` exists — author a full 8-section spec from source | `references/author.md` |
| `update` | Docs exist + code changed — section-impact-mapped updates          | `references/author.md` |
| `audit`  | `--audit` flag or user asks — staleness report per section (never mutates docs) | `references/author.md` |
| `amend`  | `[mode=amend]` from the bugfix workflow — minimal regression-scoped §3/§4/§8 touch only | `references/author.md` |
| `tests`  | Generate or update Section 8 `TC-{FEATURE}-{NNN}` test specifications | `references/tests.md`  |
| `sync`   | Reconcile §8 TCs ↔ integration test code (forward/reverse/harvest, orphan, staleness); `harvest` captures a SPEC-SILENT invariant into §4/§5/§8 | `references/sync.md`   |

**Mode resolution (do this before any work):**

1. Parse the mode from the invocation: explicit `[mode=<x>]` arg wins; else infer from request + repo state ("from idea/requirements/prompt", "draft spec", "no code yet" → `draft`; no `docs/specs/{Bucket}/` AND code exists to source from → `init`; docs exist + diff → `update`; "audit/stale" → `audit`; bugfix caller → `amend`; "write/update test specs", "TCs" → `tests`; "sync tests", "reconcile §8 with tests" → `sync`). **`draft` vs `init`:** both author a new spec, but `draft` sources from idea/requirement text (no code → `Evidence: TBD`, provisional) while `init` sources from existing code (real `[Source:]` evidence). "No docs" alone does NOT imply `init` — check whether code exists to source from. `draft` never auto-overwrites existing §8 TCs.
2. If ambiguous, present the detected mode via a direct user question before proceeding — NEVER auto-start a mutating mode.
3. **Read the matching `references/` body** — it is the single source of truth for that mode's procedure, gates, and output contract. Do not run a mode from memory.

**Key Rules (all modes):**

- **[BLOCKING]** Read `docs/project-reference/spec-principles.md` — repo-local prose/evidence rules (§3 prose scope + §3.2 banned prose-token list). For the AI-implementability criteria + tech-agnostic mandates, read `.claude/skills/shared/sdd-artifact-contract.md` ("AI-Implementability Gate" + mandates M1-M6) — those are the canonical authority, not the local stub.
- **[BLOCKING]** EVERY test case MUST carry verifiable code evidence as a `[Source: namespace/service/id]` abstract anchor in its Section 8 hidden carrier — physical `file:line` lives only in the provenance sidecar.
  > **Exception (`mode=draft`):** an idea-sourced spec has no code yet — its §8 TCs carry `Evidence: TBD` (reference-only) and the spec is flagged provisional (`provisional: true` frontmatter + a "DRAFT — unverified until code lands" header banner). The first `update`/`init` run against real code MUST upgrade every `TBD` to a real `[Source:]` anchor and clear the provisional flag. This mirrors existing TDD-first handling — it relaxes evidence ONLY for draft, never for code-sourced modes.
- **[BLOCKING]** Section 8 is the **canonical TC registry** — §8 TCs are the source of truth; integration test code implements them. The `tests` mode owns generation; `sync` mode reconciles drift; the author modes (`draft`/`init`) populate §8 at authoring time (`draft` with `Evidence: TBD`, `init` with real `[Source:]`) and MUST NOT overwrite existing TCs during UPDATE.
- Authored docs MUST match the master template's **8 tech-free sections** (Overview, Glossary, User Stories & AC, Business Rules, Domain Model, Process Flows & Interaction Surface, Permissions & Roles, Test Specifications) + YAML frontmatter — zero technical terms in prose, size caps enforced.
- **[BLOCKING] Canonical TC format authority:** `.claude/skills/shared/tc-format.md` (GWT template, Evidence carrier, decade-numbering, Preservation Tests). **M1-M6 mandates:** `.claude/skills/shared/sdd-artifact-contract.md` — any violation FAILS the artifact.

> `docs/project-reference/feature-spec-reference.md` — project-specific Feature Spec patterns (read directly when relevant). `docs/project-reference/domain-entities-reference.md` — domain entity catalog, relationships, cross-service sync.

### 8-Section Feature Spec Rules (canonical reference)

> Canonical home for the Feature Spec rules; applies to any edit under the Feature Spec docs root.

**Format:** Tech-free 8-section Feature Spec. Activate the `$spec` skill before editing.

**Read first:** `docs/project-reference/feature-spec-reference.md`, `docs/project-reference/spec-system-reference.md`, and `docs/project-reference/spec-principles.md`. For behavior/public-contract changes, also read `docs/project-reference/workflow-spec-test-code-cycle-reference.md`.

**8 sections (exact order):** 1. Overview · 2. Glossary · 3. User Stories & Acceptance Criteria · 4. Business Rules · 5. Domain Model · 6. Process Flows & Interaction Surface · 7. Permissions & Roles · 8. Test Specifications. No technical sections (Commands/Events/API/Cross-Service/Performance/Troubleshooting) — code is the technical source of truth.

> §6 carries a tech-agnostic interaction surface (views/nav/observable states/per-story click-paths) per the `SYNC:ui-intent-layer` block this skill carries; backend-only specs state the skip reason explicitly. This does NOT contradict "No technical sections" — the interaction surface is tech-agnostic INTENT (UX roles, information, states, flows), not a technical "UI Pages" section; M1-clean keeps it free of framework/route/CSS/component-class names.

**Mandatory:**

- §1-7 prose is STRICTLY tech-free — no framework/product/language/persistence/messaging/auth names (banned tokens → `spec-principles.md` §3.2). Technical identifiers live ONLY in evidence carriers.
- Section 5 (Domain Model): Mermaid ERD + `[Source: component/{service}/{id}]` abstract anchor per entity (cannot be omitted)
- Section 4 (Business Rules): `[Source: rule/{service}/{id}]` abstract anchor per rule group
- Section 8 (Test Specifications): canonical TC source — TC-{FEATURE}-{NNN} IDs, each carrying a hidden `[Source: namespace/service/id]` carrier + an `IntegrationTest:` field

**Rules:**

- TC IDs live in Section 8 only — never authored in `docs/specs/` directly
- Section 8 authored via `$spec [mode=tests]`; `$spec [mode=init]` populates it only during initial authoring
- No line-count cap applies to Feature Specs. Split the capability only when TCs>40 or distinct module-level capabilities emerge.

### M1-M6 Compliance (BLOCKING — applies to every authored spec and every TC)

See `.claude/skills/shared/sdd-artifact-contract.md` → "AI-SDD Mandates (M1-M6)" for the full BLOCKING criteria. In brief: **M1** tech-agnostic prose; **M2** no source code in prose; **M3** logical-IDs-first traceability with a SEPARATE `[Source:]` carrier; **M4** AI-implementability (one interpretation, named success/failure); **M5** rebuild-from-scratch on any stack from §1-8 prose alone. Tech terms are allowed ONLY inside evidence carriers (`**Evidence**`, `IntegrationTest`, `[Source:]`), YAML frontmatter, and ` ```mermaid ``` ` blocks.

## Derived-Index Delegation

This skill owns the **canonical** Feature Spec (§1-8) and its §8 TC registry. The bucket `INDEX.md` and cross-capability ERD are **derived** artifacts regenerated by `$spec-index` FROM these specs — never a source of truth, and never authored here. In `update` mode, flag "derived spec artifact refresh may be required" but do NOT trigger `$spec-index` directly (separation of concerns).

---

## Workflow Recommendation

> **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION — NO EXCEPTIONS:** If you are NOT already in a workflow, you MUST ATTENTION use a direct user question to ask the user. Do NOT judge task complexity or decide this is "simple enough to skip" — the user decides whether to use a workflow, not you:
>
> 1. **Activate `workflow-feature` workflow** (Recommended) — spec-driven with tests by default: scout → investigate → spec-discovery → domain-analysis → why-review → spec → spec-clarify → plan → plan-review → plan-validate → why-review → spec [mode=tests] → why-review → review-artifact --type=spec-tests → plan → plan-review → feature-implement → review-domain-entities → spec [mode=tests] → why-review → review-artifact --type=spec-tests → spec [mode=sync] → integration-test → integration-test-review → integration-test-verify → workflow-review-changes → production-readiness-review → security-review → changelog → test → docs-update → workflow-end → watzup
> 2. **Execute `$spec` directly** — run this skill standalone in the resolved mode

---

## Next Steps

**[BLOCKING]** After completing, use a direct user question to present options. Do NOT skip — user decides:

- **"$spec [mode=tests] (Recommended)"** — Generate/update Section 8 test specs for the documented features (if you just authored/updated a spec)
- **"$spec [mode=sync]"** — Reconcile Section 8 TCs ↔ integration test code
- **"$review-artifact --type=spec-tests"** — Audit TC coverage + GIVEN/WHEN/THEN quality
- **"Skip, continue manually"** — user decides

> **[IMPORTANT]** Use task tracking to break ALL work into small tasks BEFORE starting — including tasks for each file read. This prevents context loss from long files. For simple tasks, AI MUST ATTENTION ask user whether to skip.

<!-- SYNC:ui-intent-layer -->

> **[BLOCKING] Capture a tech-agnostic UI/UX intent layer in every UI-bearing spec — a reader must be able to visualize how the feature works without naming any technology.** When the feature has a user interface, the spec MUST ATTENTION carry an interaction-surface section so the application — not just its API — can be rebuilt on any stack:
>
> 1. **View Inventory** — list each view/screen by its UX ROLE and purpose (e.g. "list of items", "item editor", "confirmation step") and what information it presents. Describe by role, never by an implementation name.
> 2. **Navigation Map** — how a user moves between views: entry points, transitions, and exits. Trace how this surface connects to neighboring features already in the system.
> 3. **Key observable UI States** — the distinct states a user can observe per view (empty, loading, populated, error, success, permission-denied, etc.) — described as what the user perceives, not how it is rendered.
> 4. **Per-story interaction flow** — for each user story, the step-by-step click/action path from intent to outcome, cross-referenced to the logical IDs the spec already owns (`US-`/`OP-`/`BR-`).
> 5. **Couple to the companion design artifact** — keep deep visual fidelity (layout, tokens, pixel detail) OUT of the spec; it lives in the linked `design-spec`/mockup. Record that companion's path in the spec frontmatter so the spec stays the navigable hub.
>
> **M1-clean (NON-NEGOTIABLE):** the prose names ZERO frameworks, routes/URLs, CSS, or component-class names — only roles, information, states, and flows. Technology detail belongs in the companion design artifact, never here.
>
> **Skip ONLY** when the feature is backend-only (no UI) — state that reason explicitly in the section.

## Closing Reminders

- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION Goal:** Produce a tech-free, AI-implementable Feature Spec whose Section 8 TC registry stays the single source of truth, traceable to integration test code — so any team can rebuild the feature on any stack from the spec alone

**Protocols in force (concise digest of the SYNC/shared blocks this skill carries — MUST ATTENTION honor each canonical body):**

- **Cross-Service Check:** ALWAYS scan producers, consumers, sagas, contracts before concluding; missing consumer = silent regression.
- **Evidence:** cite `file:line` for every claim; confidence >80% to act, <60% NEVER recommend.
- **Critical Thinking:** apply critical + sequential thinking; NEVER present a guess as fact.
- **AI Mistake Prevention:** verify generated content against evidence, trace downstream references, verify all affected outputs, re-read after context loss, surface ambiguity.

- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION [BLOCKING]** Resolve the mode FIRST and read its `references/{author,tests,sync}.md` body — NEVER run `draft`/`init`/`update`/`audit`/`amend`/`tests`/`sync` from memory; ambiguous → a direct user question before any mutating mode — why: each mode's gates + output contract live in its body, not in this entry skill
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION [BLOCKING]** EVERY test case MUST carry verifiable code evidence as a `[Source: namespace/service/id]` abstract anchor in its Section 8 hidden carrier — physical `file:line` → provenance sidecar only; sole exception `mode=draft` (`Evidence: TBD` + provisional flag, upgraded to real anchor on first code-sourced run) — why: a TC without evidence is unverifiable and silently rots
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION [BLOCKING]** Section 8 is the canonical TC registry — existing TCs MUST NOT be overwritten during `update`; `tests` mode owns generation, `sync` mode reconciles drift — why: integration test code implements §8, so overwriting it orphans real tests
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION [BLOCKING]** §1-7 prose is STRICTLY tech-free — no framework/product/language/persistence/messaging/auth names (banned tokens → `spec-principles.md` §3.2); technical identifiers live ONLY in evidence carriers, frontmatter, and mermaid blocks — why: M1/M5 require rebuild-from-scratch on any stack
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION [BLOCKING]** Honor M1-M6 mandates (`.claude/skills/shared/sdd-artifact-contract.md`) + canonical TC format (`.claude/skills/shared/tc-format.md`) — any violation FAILS the artifact; no line-count cap applies, split only for TC volume or distinct capabilities
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** `INDEX.md`/ERD are DERIVED — flag refresh need in `update`, NEVER trigger `$spec-index` here — why: separation of concerns keeps the canonical spec the only source of truth
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** evidence gate — cite `file:line`/grep for every claim, confidence >80% to act, <60% do NOT recommend; verify AI-generated TC/source anchors against ACTUAL code (grep to confirm) before authoring — why: hallucinated `[Source:]` anchors break traceability
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** cross-service check before concluding any spec/§8 work — scan producers, consumers, sagas, contracts; per touchpoint owner · message · risk (NONE/ADDITIVE/BREAKING) — why: a missing downstream consumer is a silent regression
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION [BLOCKING]** Break work into small task tracking tasks BEFORE starting (one per file read) + a final review task; on context loss the current task list first, never duplicate — why: long spec files exhaust context and lose un-tracked progress
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** Search codebase for 3+ similar patterns and read existing spec siblings before authoring new content — match local conventions over generic defaults

**Anti-Rationalization:**

| Evasion                                          | Rebuttal                                                                                           |
| ------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "Mode is obvious, skip the `references/` body"   | The body owns gates + output contract — running from memory drifts. Read it every time.            |
| "This TC's source is clear, skip the anchor"     | No `[Source:]` carrier (or `Evidence: TBD` for non-draft) = unverifiable TC. Add the anchor.        |
| "`update` — just regenerate Section 8"           | §8 is canonical; integration tests implement it. NEVER overwrite — `sync` reconciles drift.        |
| "One tech name in prose is harmless"             | One banned token fails M1 and breaks rebuild-on-any-stack. Move it to an evidence carrier.          |
| "Small spec, skip task tracking"                 | Skip depth, NEVER skip tracking — context loss wipes un-tracked progress.                           |
| "Index looks stale, I'll just run `$spec-index`" | Not this skill's job — flag the refresh need; derived artifacts regenerate separately.              |

**[TASK-PLANNING]** MUST ATTENTION analyze task scope and break into small todo tasks/sub-tasks via task tracking before acting.

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** Resolve the mode FIRST + read its `references/` body · EVERY §8 TC carries a `[Source:]` evidence anchor (except `mode=draft`) · §1-7 prose STRICTLY tech-free — the three rules this skill must never skip.

## Hookless Prompt Protocol Mirror (Auto-Synced)

Source: `.claude/.ck.json` + `.claude/skills/shared/sync-inline-versions.md` (`:full` blocks) + `.claude/scripts/lib/hookless-prompt-protocol.cjs`

## [WORKFLOW-EXECUTION-PROTOCOL] [BLOCKING] Workflow Execution Protocol — MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST CRITICAL. Do not skip for any reason.

**Generic portability boundary:** Reusable skills and protocol text stay project-neutral; project-specific conventions are discovered from docs/project-config.json and docs/project-reference/. Apply shared AI-SDD from `shared/sdd-artifact-contract.md`. Read `docs/project-config.json` and `docs/project-reference/docs-index-reference.md`, then open the project reference docs named there. For spec, test-case, behavior-change, public-contract, or `docs/specs/` work, route through the local spec docs named by the docs index: `feature-spec-reference.md`, `spec-system-reference.md`, `spec-principles.md`, and `workflow-spec-test-code-cycle-reference.md` when specs/tests/code must stay synchronized. If either file or a required reference doc is missing or stale, auto-run `$project-init` (or the narrow lower-level route such as `$project-config`, `$docs-init`, `$scan-all`, or `$scan --target=<key>`) before ordinary project-specific work. Any supported AI tool may execute when this shared context and local docs are available.

1. **DETECT:** If the prompt starts with an explicit slash skill/workflow command, execute it directly. Otherwise match the prompt against the workflow catalog and skill list.
2. **ANALYZE:** Choose the best option: execute directly, invoke a skill, activate a standard workflow, or compose a custom step combination.
3. **AUTO-SELECT:** Pick the best option yourself. Do not ask the user to choose between direct execution, skill, standard workflow, or custom workflow.
4. **ACTIVATE:** For a selected workflow, call `$start-workflow <workflowId>`; for a selected skill, invoke that skill; for a custom workflow, sequence custom steps directly; for direct execution, proceed with the task.
5. **CREATE TASKS:** task tracking for ALL workflow/skill/custom steps before execution when the selected path has multiple steps.
6. **EXECUTE:** Advance per the **Workflow Step Advancement & Parallel Phases** rule in your context instructions — model-driven; a sub-agent completion advances a step identically to an inline call; a parallel-phase group is an all-return barrier (advance only after ALL members return, never serialize it)

> **AI-SDD Artifact Contract** — Shared spec-driven development rules stay portable and source-owned.
>
> 1. Keep reusable AI-SDD principles in `.claude`; put repository-specific paths, commands, owners, products, and formats in project config/reference docs.
> 2. Preserve cycle: `spec -> plan -> tasks -> implement -> verify -> update spec/docs`.
> 3. Trace every requirement or invariant through decision, task, TC/test, source evidence, and docs/spec update.
> 4. Treat code-to-spec extraction as reference-only until accepted by the canonical spec owner.
> 5. Any supported AI tool may plan, implement, review, or verify with synced context; using multiple tools is optional.
> 6. Update `.claude` source first, then sync generated mirrors; do not manually edit `.agents`, `.codex`, or `AGENTS.md`. — why: mirrors are generated artifacts; hand-edits are overwritten on the next sync
> 7. If `docs/project-config.json`, root instruction files, or a required project-reference doc is missing or stale, auto-run `$project-init` or the narrow lower-level route before ordinary project-specific work.

## SYNC:ai-sdd-artifact-contract:reminder

- **MANDATORY** Apply `shared/sdd-artifact-contract.md`; keep reusable AI-SDD in `.claude` and local rules in project docs.
- **MANDATORY** Code-to-spec extraction is reference-only until canonical acceptance; any supported AI tool may execute with synced context.
- **MANDATORY** Update `.claude` source before syncing generated mirrors; do not manually edit `.agents`, `.codex`, or `AGENTS.md`.
- **MANDATORY** Missing or stale project config, root instruction files, or required reference docs route project-specific work through `$project-init` or the narrow setup route automatically.
**[TASK-PLANNING] [MANDATORY]** BEFORE executing any workflow or skill step, create/update task tracking for all planned steps, then keep it synchronized as each step starts/completes.
## [LESSON-LEARNED-REMINDER] [BLOCKING] Task Planning & Continuous Improvement — MANDATORY. Do not skip.

Break work into small tasks (task tracking) before starting. Add final task: "Analyze AI mistakes & lessons learned".

**Extract lessons — ROOT CAUSE ONLY, not symptom fixes:**
1. Name the FAILURE MODE (reasoning/assumption failure), not symptom — "assumed API existed without reading source" not "used wrong enum value".
2. Generality test: does this failure mode apply to ≥3 contexts/codebases? If not, abstract one level up.
3. Write as a universal rule — strip project-specific names/paths/classes. Useful on any codebase.
4. Consolidate: multiple mistakes sharing one failure mode → ONE lesson.
5. **Recurrence gate:** "Would this recur in future session WITHOUT this reminder?" — No → skip `$learn`.
6. **Auto-fix gate:** "Could `$code-review`/`$code-simplifier`/`$security-review`/`$lint` catch this?" — Yes → improve review skill instead.
7. BOTH gates pass → ask user to run `$learn`.
**[CRITICAL-THINKING-MINDSET]** Apply critical thinking, sequential thinking. Every claim needs traced proof, confidence >80% to act.
**Anti-hallucination principle:** Never present guess as fact — cite sources for every claim, admit uncertainty freely, self-check output for errors, cross-reference independently, stay skeptical of own confidence — certainty without evidence root of all hallucination.
**AI Attention principle (Primacy-Recency):** Put the 3 most critical rules at both top and bottom of long prompts/protocols so instruction adherence survives long context windows.
**Goal-driven execution:** Define success criteria first, loop until verified, and stop only when observable checks pass.
**Tests verify intent:** Tests must protect business rules/invariants and fail when the protected intent breaks, not only mirror current behavior.
## Common AI Mistake Prevention (System Lessons)

- **Re-read files after context compaction.** Edit requires prior Read in same context; compaction wipes read state. Re-read before editing.
- **Grep for old terms after bulk replacements.** AI over-trusts find/replace completeness. Grep full repo after bulk edits for missed refs in docs/configs/catalogs.
- **Check downstream references before deleting.** Deletions cascade doc/code staleness. Map referencing files before removal.
- **After memory loss, check existing state before creating new.** Compaction wipes prior-work memory. Query current state to resume — never blindly duplicate.
- **Verify AI-generated content against actual code.** AI hallucinates APIs, class names, method signatures. Grep to confirm existence before documenting/referencing.
- **Trace full dependency chain after edits.** Changing a definition misses downstream consumers. Trace the full chain.
- **When renaming, grep ALL consumer file types.** Some file types silently ignore missing refs (no compile error). Search code, templates, configs, generated files.
- **Trace ALL code paths when verifying correctness.** Code existing ≠ code executing. Trace early exits, error branches, conditional skips — not just happy path.
- **Update docs that embed canonical data when source changes.** Docs inlining derived data (workflows, schemas, configs) go stale silently. Update all embedding docs alongside source.
- **Verify sub-agent results after context recovery.** Background agents may finish while parent compacted — grep-verify output, don't trust assumed completion.
- **Cross-check full target list against sub-agent assignments.** Parallel sub-agents by category miss boundary items. Reconcile union of assignments against target list before proceeding.
- **Sub-agents inherit knowledge only from their agent .md definition — use custom agent types, not built-in Explore.** Tool adoption = permission + knowledge + enforcement (numbered workflow step).
- **Persist sub-agent findings incrementally, not as a final batch.** Long sub-agents hit cutoffs before final write — findings lost. Instruct append-per-section to report file.
- **When debugging, ask "whose responsibility?" before fixing.** Trace caller (wrong data) vs callee (wrong handling). Fix at responsible layer — never patch symptom site.
- **Grep ALL removed names after extraction/refactoring.** Primary file "done" ≠ secondary files clean. Grep entire scope for every removed symbol before declaring complete.
- **Assume existing values are intentional — ask WHY before changing.** Pattern-matching as "wrong" skips context. Before changing any constant/limit/flag: read comments, git blame, surrounding code.
- **Verify ALL affected outputs, not just the first.** One build green ≠ all green. Multi-stack changes (backend/frontend/tests/docs) require verifying EVERY output.
- **Evaluate fit before copying a nearby pattern.** Closest example ≠ matching preconditions — verify the new context shares the same constraints, base classes, scope, lifetime.
- **Holistic-first debugging — resist nearest-attention trap.** Don't dive into first plausible cause. List EVERY precondition (config, env vars, paths, DB, endpoints, creds, versions, DI, data). Verify each against evidence (grep/query — not reasoning). Ask "what would falsify this?" — if nothing, it's not a hypothesis. Most expensive failure: going deeper in "obvious" layer while bug sits in layer never questioned.
- **Surgical changes — apply the diff test (context-aware).** Two modes: (1) Bug fix → every line traces to the bug; no restyling; orphan cleanup only for imports YOUR changes made unused. (2) Review/enhancement → implement improvements AND announce as "Enhancement beyond main request: [what]". Never silently scope-creep. Diff test: "Would this line exist if I wasn't asked to do X?" — if no, delete or announce.
- **Surface ambiguity before coding — don't pick silently.** Multiple valid interpretations → present each with effort: "[Request] could mean (1) [N h], (2) [N h]. Which matters?" List scope/format/volume/constraints assumptions first. If simpler path exists, say so. Never silently pick.
- **[MANDATORY FIRST ACTION] ALWAYS activate a suitable skill or workflow BEFORE responding.** Match task against workflow catalog + skill list; invoke via skill invocation or `$start-workflow <workflowId>`. NEVER answer or write code before checking. Skip = protocol violation.
- **Why-Review adversarial mindset — apply when reviewing any plan, decision, or design.** Default SKEPTIC not VALIDATOR: steel-man a rejected alternative, invert each stated reason ("what does it sacrifice?"), stress-test top 2-3 assumptions, run pre-mortem ("ships, fails in 3 months — what breaks?"), surface 1-2 alternatives author missed. Section presence ≠ quality; quality = causal reasoning + concrete mitigations + evidence, not "it's better" or "monitor closely".
- **Front-load report-write in sub-agent prompts for large reviews.** Many-file sub-agents hit budget before final write — findings lost. Design prompts so: (1) report-write is first explicit deliverable, (2) append per-file/section (not batched), (3) scope bounded so reads don't exhaust budget. Truncated mid-sentence with no report file → spawn narrower scope, don't retry same prompt.
- **After context compaction, re-verify all prior phase outcomes before continuing.** Summaries describe intent, not environment state (git index, filesystem, processes). On resume, FIRST audit: git status, re-read modified files, verify filesystem. Every "completed" claim is an untested hypothesis until evidence confirms.
- **OOM/memory: check row count before row size.** Triage: (1) Unbounded query — no DB filter for trigger? Push filter to DB; eliminates OOM. (2) Large rows? Projection reduces proportionally. Row reduction > projection in ROI.
- **Keep domain concepts out of generic/shared/infrastructure layers.** Reusable layer (shared library, framework, infra module) must reference NO consumer-specific domain concept — tenant/customer/product IDs, business entities, feature rules. Leak compiles + runs → passes review silently while coupling the "reusable" layer to one consumer. Keep shared type domain-free; push domain fields/logic down into the consumer via subclass/composition. — why: a layer coupled to one consumer's domain is no longer reusable.
