## Codex Project-Reference Loading (No Hooks)

Codex uses static project-reference loading instead of runtime-injected project docs.
When coding, planning, debugging, testing, or reviewing, open project docs explicitly using this routing.

**Always read:**
- `docs/project-config.json` (project-specific paths, commands, modules, and workflow/test settings)
- `docs/project-reference/docs-index-reference.md` (routes to the full `docs/project-reference/*` catalog)
- `docs/project-reference/lessons.md` (always-on guardrails and anti-patterns)

**Missing/stale context route:** If `docs/project-config.json`, the docs index, `lessons.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, or any task-required reference doc is missing or stale, auto-run `$project-init` or the narrow setup route (`$project-config`, `$docs-init`, `$scan-all`, `$scan --target=<key>`, `$claude-md-init`) before ordinary project-specific work. If Codex mirrors or `AGENTS.md` are missing/stale, ask the user to run `$sync-codex`; do not auto-run it.

**Situation-based docs:**
- Project structure/architecture/tech-stack/deployment/setup (any layer — backend, frontend, or infra): `project-structure-reference.md`
- Backend/CQRS/API/domain/entity changes: `backend-patterns-reference.md`, `domain-entities-reference.md`
- Frontend/UI/styling/design-system: `frontend-patterns-reference.md`, `scss-styling-guide.md`, `design-system/README.md`
- Spec authoring, `docs/specs/` pathing, or TC format: `feature-spec-reference.md`, `spec-system-reference.md`, `spec-principles.md`
- Behavior/public-contract changes or spec-test-code sync: `workflow-spec-test-code-cycle-reference.md` plus the spec docs above
- Derived spec indexes/ERDs/reimplementation guides: `spec-system-reference.md` and source Feature Specs under `docs/specs/`
- Integration test implementation/review: `integration-test-reference.md`
- E2E test implementation/review: `e2e-test-reference.md`
- Code review/audit work: `code-review-rules.md` plus domain docs above based on changed files

Do not read all docs blindly. Start from `docs-index-reference.md`, then open only relevant files for the task.

## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Generate and validate the project's architecture scaffolding — all base classes, interfaces, infrastructure abstractions, and reusable foundation code — BEFORE any feature story implementation begins, producing a copy-ready, OOP/SOLID-compliant architecture foundation with quality-gate tooling that every feature story reuses before implementation starts.

**Summary:**
- **Testability contract:** resolve Unit/Integration/System/E2E applicability from runner/config evidence; record owner/root/data, copy-ready full + focused commands, zero-match behavior, CI/simple-Windows entry, unique run/data identity, and repeat proof; unresolved applicable fields block handoff, while non-applicable tiers require evidence-backed `N/A`.

- **Gate-first:** check Activation Guards before any work — proceed ONLY in `workflow-greenfield-init` / `workflow-big-feature` AND when grep finds NO existing base/abstract/infrastructure scaffolding; otherwise SKIP and mark the step completed.
- **Main steps (do ALL, in order):** (1) Read Plan — parse tech stack, architecture decisions, domain model; (2) Generate Scaffolding Checklist from the Backend + Frontend/UI categories; (3) Validate Against Plan — every architecture decision has a scaffolding item; (4) Present to User by asking the user directly to confirm the checklist; (5) Scaffold — create all base classes, interfaces, abstractions, infra code + the 5 production-readiness foundations; (6) Verify — build/compile + OOP/SOLID compliance + Verification Gate. Then invoke `$linter-setup` → `$harness-setup`, then ask the user directly handoff.
- **Scope:** architecture-infrastructure creation (base classes, interfaces, DI, repos, cross-cutting), NOT feature implementation — checklists are TEMPLATES: adapt naming to the detected tech stack, skip irrelevant items, add plan-specific ones.
- **Production-readiness:** stand up all 5 foundations (code-quality tooling, error handling, loading state, Docker, integration points) and delegate ALL sensor setup to `$linter-setup` then `$harness-setup` — never hand-configure linters/hooks here. — why: a checklist of installs is not a harness.
- **Hard gate:** enforce OOP/SOLID on every base class and HARD-BLOCK the handoff to `$feature-implement` until the Verification Gate passes — all 5 foundations verified plus `$linter-setup` and `$harness-setup` complete.

**Purpose:** Scaffolded project copy-ready as starter template. All base code, utilities, interfaces, infrastructure services created — best-practice setup, generic functions any feature story reuses.

**Key distinction:** Architecture infrastructure creation, NOT feature implementation — the foundation layer all stories build upon.

**Be skeptical. Apply critical thinking, sequential thinking. Every claim needs traced proof, confidence percentages (Idea should be more than 80%).**

## Activation Guards (MANDATORY — Check Before Executing)

**ALL conditions must be true to proceed:**

1. **Workflow check:** Active workflow is `workflow-greenfield-init` OR `workflow-big-feature`. If not → SKIP this skill entirely, mark step as completed.
2. **Existing scaffolding check:** AI MUST ATTENTION self-investigate for existing base/foundational abstractions:
    - Abstract/base classes: grep `abstract class.*Base|Base[A-Z]\w+|Abstract[A-Z]\w+`
    - Generic interfaces: grep `interface I\w+<|IGeneric|IBase`
    - Infrastructure abstractions: grep `IRepository|IUnitOfWork|IService|IHandler`
    - Utility/extension layers: grep `Extensions|Helpers|Utils|Common` (directories or classes)
    - Frontend foundations: grep `base.*component|base.*service|base.*store|abstract.*component` (case-insensitive)
    - DI/IoC registration: grep `AddScoped|AddSingleton|providers:|NgModule|@Injectable`
3. **If existing scaffolding found → SKIP.** Log: "Existing scaffolding detected at {file:line}. Skipping $scaffold step." Mark step as completed.
4. **If NO foundational abstractions found → PROCEED** with full scaffolding workflow below.

## When to Use

- After the second `$plan` + `$plan-review` in greenfield-init or big-feature workflows
- Before `$feature-implement` begins implementing feature stories
- When a new service/module needs its own base architecture within an existing project
- **NOT** when the project already has established base classes and infrastructure

## Workflow

1. **Read Plan** — Parse the implementation plan for architecture decisions, tech stack, and domain model
2. **Generate Scaffolding Checklist** — Produce a checklist of all required base classes and infrastructure from the Backend + Frontend checklists below
3. **Validate Against Plan** — Ensure every architecture decision in the plan has corresponding scaffolding items
4. **Present to User** — Use ask the user directly to confirm checklist before generating code
5. **Scaffold** — Create all base classes, interfaces, abstractions, and infrastructure code
6. **Verify** — Compile/build to ensure no syntax errors; validate OOP/SOLID compliance

## Backend Scaffolding Categories

AI must self-investigate chosen tech stack, produce a checklist covering these categories. Names below are illustrative — adapt to the project's language, framework conventions, and actual needs.

### Domain Layer

- [ ] Base entity interface + abstract class (Id, timestamps, audit fields)
- [ ] Value object base (equality by value)
- [ ] Domain event interface

### Application Layer

- [ ] Command/query handler abstractions (CQRS if applicable)
- [ ] Validation result pattern
- [ ] Base DTO with mapping protocol
- [ ] Pagination wrapper
- [ ] Operation result pattern (success/failure)

### Infrastructure Layer

- [ ] Generic repository interface + one concrete implementation
- [ ] Unit of work interface (if applicable)
- [ ] Messaging/event bus abstraction
- [ ] External service abstractions (cache, storage, email — only if plan requires them)
- [ ] Database context / connection setup
- [ ] DI/IoC registration module

### Cross-Cutting

- [ ] Current user context abstraction
- [ ] Testable date/time provider
- [ ] Exception hierarchy (domain, validation, not-found)
- [ ] Error handling middleware
- [ ] Strongly-typed configuration models

## Frontend Scaffolding Categories

### Core Architecture

- [ ] Base component with lifecycle/destroy cleanup
- [ ] Base form component with validation, dirty tracking
- [ ] Base list component with pagination, sorting, filtering

### State & API

- [ ] Base state store with loading/error/data pattern
- [ ] Base API service with interceptors, error handling
- [ ] Auth interceptor + environment config

### Shared Utilities

- [ ] Base model with serialization helpers
- [ ] Common utility functions (date, validation, formatting)

### UI Foundation

> **Skip if:** Backend-only project, no frontend component. **Apply if:** Project has ANY frontend.

#### Design Token Files

- [ ] Create design token file(s) per chosen format (CSS custom properties / SCSS variables / JSON)
- [ ] Define minimum token set: colors (primary, secondary, surface, bg, text, error, success, warning), spacing (xs-xl), typography (heading/body/caption families + sizes), breakpoints, shadows, z-index
- [ ] Create theme file(s) if theming required (light/dark CSS classes or theme provider)

#### Base Layout & Responsive

- [ ] Base layout component (app shell: header, sidebar/nav, main content, footer)
- [ ] Responsive container/grid utility
- [ ] Responsive mixin/utility for breakpoints
- [ ] Mobile-first media query definitions

#### Base UI Components

- [ ] Loading indicator component (spinner or skeleton)
- [ ] Error display component (inline + page-level)
- [ ] Empty state component (message + action)
- [ ] Notification/toast component
- [ ] Base button component with variants (primary, secondary, ghost, danger)
- [ ] Base input component with validation display

#### Design System Documentation

- [ ] Create `docs/project-reference/design-system/README.md` skeleton with: token naming conventions, component tier classification (Common/Domain-Shared/Page), usage examples
- [ ] **Author `docs/project-reference/ui-review-principles.md`** (the project-adopted UI-review PRINCIPLES the later `$ui-review` gate reads — these are design-time decisions, hand-authored, NOT code-derived). Capture, as project-enforced principles, every UI-review dimension: **Overflow & scroll containment** (long-content truncation/wrap) · **Responsive & small-screen** (flex-wrap / row-to-column so it stays usable on small devices) · **Flex-vs-fixed sizing** (flex-grow vs hard-coded dimensions) · **z-index discipline** (a documented layering scale, no ad-hoc values) · **BEM on all elements** · **Async states** (loading indicator, user-visible error surface, empty state, in-flight disable) · **Nesting depth ≤ 3 / no magic numbers**. **Cross-link** to `design-system/README.md` and `scss-styling-guide` so the seeded principle doc and the scan-derived docs form one navigable set. Contains NO real endpoints/keys.
  - **No-UI skip rule:** author this doc ONLY when a frontend/UI stack is scaffolded. Backend-only project → SKIP and log the reason.

## Example / Golden-Path Reference Scaffolding (copy-me implementations — MANDATORY)

> **MANDATORY when scaffolding a foundation:** beyond the empty base abstractions above, emit **ONE worked, compile-checked example per best-practice pattern** — a copy-me reference implementation per layer. Empty abstractions are unverified skeletons; a worked example built ON TOP turns each base class into demonstrated, reviewable usage. This example set is exactly what Phase-02's `$architecture-review-full` grades, so it must exist before that gate runs.

### Location & lifecycle (isolated, production-excluded)

- Examples live in a DEDICATED, ISOLATED `examples/` tree (project-root `examples/` or `docs/project-reference/examples/`) — **NEVER mixed into the production `src/` tree.**
- Name every file `*.example.*` (e.g. `create-order.command.example.ts`, `Order.entity.example.cs`).
- **CI-compiled/linted but EXCLUDED from the production build** via a project-appropriate mechanism (separate compile target / tsconfig references / test-only project / build-exclude glob).
- Devs COPY an example into `src/` to start a real feature; the whole `examples/` tree is deleted wholesale once no longer needed.

### One worked example per applicable pattern (target ≥ 11)

- **Backend:** command · query · command/query handler · entity-with-invariants · value-object · repository (concrete impl) · domain event + event handler.
- **Frontend (only if a UI stack is present):** form component · list component · state store · API service.
- **Tests:** one example integration test exercising the example command/query on BOTH the happy path AND a failure path.
- **Absent-layer skips:** render fewer ONLY when a layer is genuinely absent (e.g. a backend-only project skips the frontend examples) — LOG each skipped example and WHY.

### Every example MUST

1. Follow the project's detected patterns — read `docs/project-reference/*-patterns-reference.md` and mirror the exact shapes.
2. USE the scaffolded base abstractions (demonstrate them in action; do NOT re-implement them).
3. Compile/lint clean under the CI (non-production) target.
4. Carry this header comment verbatim (adapt the comment syntax to the language): `GOLDEN-PATH EXAMPLE — copy into src/ for real features; the examples/ tree is deleted when unused; NOT compiled into the production build.`
5. Contain **NO secrets, real credentials, or real endpoints** — use obvious placeholders ONLY (`EXAMPLE_API_KEY`, `example.invalid`, `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000`).
6. **Frontend examples only — carry the project's token system, never literals (`DD-2`, `DD-8`).** Every colour, size, spacing, radius, and type value in a frontend golden-path example resolves to the scaffolded design tokens or the project's design-system doc; raw hex and magic numbers are forbidden here more strictly than anywhere else in the codebase. **These four files are the shape every later feature copies, so a generic example propagates further than a generic screen** — if the foundation has no design plan yet, the examples adopt the design-system doc and the scaffold report NAMES the missing plan as an open decision rather than inventing a palette. Demonstrate the five states (default/hover/focus/active/disabled) plus loading/error/empty on the form and list examples, and keep the visible strings written as real interface copy (`SYNC:ui-copywriting`) — an example that ships "Submit" and "lorem ipsum" teaches both.

### Right-sizing

Examples DEMONSTRATE patterns — NOT a feature. Honor the scale-tier guard: a tiny T0/B0 project gets the minimal applicable set, never speculative extras.

### Testability Contract Resolution (MANDATORY before handoff)

Read the completed `architecture-design` Testability & Execution Contract matrix before generating examples. Resolve every tier in the scaffold report and carry the same decisions into `$harness-setup`:

| Tier | Required scaffold output |
| --- | --- |
| Unit | Create or document one applicable pure/domain example, its runner/root, full and focused commands, zero-match failure behavior, CI gate, and simple/Windows entry point. |
| Integration/System | Create or document one applicable public-path example, its runner/root, full and focused commands, zero-match failure behavior, CI gate, and simple/Windows entry point. |
| E2E | Create or document one applicable configured-browser journey and commands; if no framework/configuration/command is evidenced, record `N/A — {evidence}` and create no invented browser example. |

For each applicable persistent tier, the handoff also records the run/test identity and unique business-data suffix, supported public setup path, realistic valid data, count-before-create idempotent/restart-safe reference setup, additive/no-reset accumulation, mutable-root and parallel-worker isolation, realistic pacing/arrange barrier, exact result, and two consecutive no-reset full runs. If scaffold has not executed the commands yet, record `planned — {owner}` rather than claiming a pass. Include these contract rows in the existing user-confirmed final checklist; unresolved material tool choices still use the existing ask the user directly gate.

## Code Quality Gate Tooling (MANDATORY MUST ATTENTION — Setup Before Any Feature Code)

**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** scaffold ALL code quality enforcement tools as part of project infrastructure — code that passes without quality gates is technical debt from day one.

### Static Analysis & Linting

- [ ] **MANDATORY MUST ATTENTION** configure language-appropriate linter with strict ruleset (zero warnings policy on new code)
- [ ] **MANDATORY MUST ATTENTION** configure static code analyzer with quality gate thresholds (complexity, duplication) — treat line-coverage as a reported DIAGNOSTIC, NOT a build-failing threshold
- [ ] **MANDATORY MUST ATTENTION** enable compiler/transpiler strict mode and treat warnings as errors on build
- [ ] **MANDATORY MUST ATTENTION** add code style formatter with shared config (enforce consistent formatting across team)

### Build-Time Quality Enforcement

- [ ] **MANDATORY MUST ATTENTION** configure pre-commit hooks to run linter + formatter automatically
- [ ] **MANDATORY MUST ATTENTION** configure CI pipeline to fail on any linter violation, analyzer warning, or test failure
- [ ] **MANDATORY MUST ATTENTION** do NOT gate the build on a line-coverage %; report line-coverage as a diagnostic only (low = useful untested-area signal, high ≠ quality). If a test-strength gate is wanted, gate on mutation score (surviving mutant = missing/weak assertion) with line-coverage as the diagnostic. Keep behavior/change-coverage (each behavior-changing file has a test asserting the changed outcome) as the meaningful coverage notion
- [ ] **MANDATORY MUST ATTENTION** enable security vulnerability scanning in dependency management

### Code Rules & Standards

- [ ] **MANDATORY MUST ATTENTION** create shared linter config file at project root (team-wide consistency)
- [ ] **MANDATORY MUST ATTENTION** create shared formatter config file at project root
- [ ] **MANDATORY MUST ATTENTION** create `.editorconfig` for cross-IDE consistency (indentation, encoding, line endings)
- [ ] **MANDATORY MUST ATTENTION** document code quality standards in project README or contributing guide

### Harness Integration (MANDATORY — Do Not Skip)

**MANDATORY MUST ATTENTION** delegate ALL computational sensor setup to `$linter-setup`:

- Do NOT manually configure linters, formatters, or pre-commit hooks in this skill
- `$linter-setup` handles: tool research → install → configure → pre-commit hooks → CI gates
- `$harness-setup` handles: full harness inventory (feedforward guides + all feedback types)

**WHY:** Code quality tooling is part of the project's outer agent harness. A checklist of installs is not a harness — a harness is a system of guides and sensors where each control fires at the right lifecycle stage and produces signals the agent can consume.

**After scaffold, invoke (in order):**

1. `$linter-setup` — computational feedback sensors (deterministic, fast, always-on)
2. `$harness-setup` — full harness inventory (all feedforward guides + all feedback sensors)

**Do NOT proceed to `$feature-implement` until both complete.** (`$scaffold` verification gate enforces this)

## Production Readiness Scaffolding (MANDATORY)

> **Scaffold Production Readiness** — See `<!-- SYNC:scaffold-production-readiness -->` block above for full inline protocol.

Every scaffolded project MUST ATTENTION include these 5 foundations. AI must detect tech stack from the plan/architecture report, present 2-3 options per concern by asking the user directly.

### 1. Code Quality Tooling

Handled by `$linter-setup` skill — do NOT duplicate here.
Verify completion: check that `.editorconfig`, linter config, and pre-commit hook config files exist.
If missing → block scaffold completion, invoke `$linter-setup`.

### 2. Error Handling Foundation

- Detect frontend framework → select from protocol's framework patterns
- Generate: error types, HTTP interceptor, notification service, global error handler
- Minimum 4 files for frontend, 3 for backend-only
- Run protocol's verification checklist

### 3. Loading State Management

- Detect frontend framework → select from protocol's framework patterns
- Generate: loading service, HTTP loading interceptor, loading indicator component
- Counter-based tracking, 300ms display delay, skip token mechanism
- Run protocol's verification checklist

### 4. Docker Development Environment

- Always scaffold (unless user explicitly opts out)
- Generate: docker-compose.yml (with profiles), Dockerfile (multi-stage), .dockerignore, .env.example
- Use 127.0.0.1 binding, health checks on all services, non-root user in prod
- Run protocol's verification checklist

### 5. Integration Points

- Document each outbound boundary (downstream service, queue, third-party API, shared DB)
- Configure retry + circuit breaker + timeout per outbound dependency
- Generate integration tests for both the happy path and the failure path
- Run protocol's verification checklist

### Scaffold Handoff from Architecture-Design

If an architecture report exists (from `$architecture-design`), read the "Scaffold Handoff — Tool Choices" table and use those selections instead of re-asking the user.

## OOP/SOLID Compliance Rules (ENFORCE)

1. **Single Responsibility** — Each base class handles ONE concern
2. **Open/Closed** — Base classes are extensible via inheritance, closed for modification
3. **Liskov Substitution** — Concrete implementations are substitutable for their base
4. **Interface Segregation** — Small, focused interfaces (not one giant IService)
5. **Dependency Inversion** — All infrastructure behind interfaces, injected via DI

**Purpose-oriented abstraction naming gate:** Name generated public or cross-layer interfaces, ports, and base abstractions by capability or domain contract; keep provider, SDK, framework, database, and transport details on concrete adapters (`IStorage`/`Storage` → `AzureBlobStorage`). Verify the name against the plan, callers, and implementations, preserve local language syntax, and add an abstraction only for an evidenced boundary, substitution need, or multiple meaningful implementations.

**Anti-patterns to prevent:**

- God classes combining multiple concerns
- Concrete dependencies (always depend on abstractions)
- Base classes with unused methods that subclasses must override
- Missing generic type parameters where applicable

## Adaptation Protocol

The checklists above are **templates**. Before scaffolding:

1. **Read the plan** — What tech stack was chosen?
2. **Adapt naming** — Match target framework and language conventions
3. **Skip irrelevant items** — Not every project needs every item (e.g., skip IFileStorageService if no file uploads)
4. **Add project-specific items** — The plan may require additional base classes not in the template
5. **Use ask the user directly** — Confirm final checklist with user before generating code

## Output

After scaffolding is complete:

1. **Scaffolding Report** — List of all created files with brief descriptions
2. **Build Verification** — Compilation/type-check passes
3. **Architecture Diagram** — Optional: generate diagram showing the base class hierarchy
4. **Production Readiness Verification** — All 5 concern areas verified via protocol checklists
5. **Config Files Generated** — Linter, formatter, pre-commit, Docker configs all created
6. **Golden-Path Examples** — one worked, compile-checked example per applicable pattern emitted under the isolated, production-excluded `examples/` tree; absent-layer skips logged with reason
7. **Testability Contract Resolution** — per-tier example/documentation, applicability evidence or N/A, full/focused/zero-match commands, CI/simple-Windows entry point, identity/data policy, and repeat-proof status

## Verification Gate (MANDATORY before proceeding to $feature-implement)

Run ALL verification checklists from the production readiness protocol:

- [ ] Code quality tooling verified (Section 1)
- [ ] Error handling foundation verified (Section 2)
- [ ] Loading state management verified (Section 3)
- [ ] Docker development environment verified (Section 4)
- [ ] Integration points verified (Section 5)
- [ ] `$linter-setup` completed (linter + formatter + pre-commit + CI gate configured)
- [ ] `$harness-setup` completed (harness-inventory.md produced, feedforward guides in place)
- [ ] Golden-path examples present — one worked example per applicable pattern under an isolated, production-excluded `examples/` tree; each compiles/lints under the CI (non-production) target; every example carries the `GOLDEN-PATH EXAMPLE` header and NO secrets/real endpoints; absent-layer skips logged with reason
- [ ] Testability Contract resolved — Unit/Integration/System/E2E each has evidence-backed applicability or N/A; applicable tiers have owner/root/runner, full + focused commands, zero-match behavior, CI/simple-Windows entry point, identity/data policy, and repeat proof

**BLOCK proceeding to `$feature-implement` if ANY verification item fails.** Fix issues first, then re-verify.

## Next Steps

**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION — NO EXCEPTIONS** after completing this skill, MUST ATTENTION use ask the user directly to present these options. Do NOT skip because the task seems "simple" or "obvious" — the user decides:

- **"$feature-implement (Recommended)"** — Begin implementing feature stories on top of the scaffolding
- **"$workflow-review-changes"** — Review scaffolding code before proceeding
- **"Skip, continue manually"** — user decides

> **[IMPORTANT]** Use task tracking to break ALL work into small tasks BEFORE starting — including tasks for each file read. This prevents context loss from long files. For simple tasks, AI MUST ATTENTION ask user whether to skip.

> **Evidence Gate:** MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION — every claim, finding, and recommendation requires `file:line` proof or traced evidence with confidence percentage (>80% to act, <80% must verify first).

> **Nested Task Expansion Contract** — For workflow-step invocation, the `[Workflow] ...` row is only a parent container; the child skill still creates visible phase tasks.
>
> 1. Call the current task list first. If a matching active parent workflow row exists, set `nested=true` and record `parentTaskId`; otherwise run standalone.
> 2. Create one task per declared phase before phase work. When nested, prefix subjects `[N.M] /skill-name — phase`.
> 3. When nested, link the parent with `TaskUpdate(parentTaskId, addBlockedBy: [childIds])`.
> 4. Orchestrators must pre-expand a child skill's phase list and link the workflow row before invoking that child skill or sub-agent.
> 5. Mark exactly one child `in_progress` before work and `completed` immediately after evidence is written.

If it — or the docs index, `lessons.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, or any required reference doc — is missing or stale, auto-run `$project-init` or the narrow route (`$project-config`, `$docs-init`, `$scan-all`, `$scan --target=<key>`, `$claude-md-init`) first; if Codex mirrors or `AGENTS.md` are stale, ask the user to run `$sync-codex` (never auto-run it).
> 3. Required docs by trigger: always `docs/project-reference/lessons.md`; doc lookup `docs-index-reference.md`; review `code-review-rules.md`; backend/CQRS/API `backend-patterns-reference.md`; domain/entity `domain-entities-reference.md`; frontend/UI `frontend-patterns-reference.md`; styles/design `scss-styling-guide.md` + `design-system/design-system-canonical.md`; integration tests `integration-test-reference.md`; E2E `e2e-test-reference.md`; feature docs/specs `feature-spec-reference.md` + `spec-system-reference.md` + `spec-principles.md`; behavior/public-contract/spec-test-code sync `workflow-spec-test-code-cycle-reference.md`; derived spec index/ERD/reimplementation guides `spec-system-reference.md` + source Feature Specs under `docs/specs/`; architecture/new area `project-structure-reference.md`.
> 4. Read every required doc, then before target work state: `Reference docs read: ... | Not applicable: ...`.

> **Scaffold Production Readiness** — Every scaffolded project MUST ATTENTION include 5 foundations:
>
> 1. **Code Quality Tooling** — linting, formatting, pre-commit hooks, CI gates. Specific tool choices → `docs/project-reference/` or `project-config.json`.
> 2. **Error Handling Foundation** — HTTP interceptor, error classification (4xx/5xx taxonomy), user notification, global uncaught handler.
> 3. **Loading State Management** — counter-based tracker (not boolean toggle), skip-token for background requests, 300ms flicker guard.
> 4. **Docker Development Environment** — compose profiles (`dev`/`test`/`infra`), multi-stage Dockerfile, health checks on all services, non-root production user.
> 5. **Integration Points** — document each outbound boundary; configure retry + circuit breaker + timeout; integration tests for happy path and failure path.
>
> **BLOCK `$feature-implement` if any foundation is unchecked.** Present 2-3 options per concern by asking the user directly before implementing.

<!-- SYNC:harness-setup -->

> **Harness Engineering** — An outer agent harness has two jobs: raise first-attempt quality + provide self-correction feedback loops before human review.
>
> **Controls split:**
>
> | Axis        | Type          | Examples                                                                      | Frequency        |

> **Test-strength sensor — gate on mutation score, NOT line coverage.** Line coverage is a DIAGNOSTIC only: low coverage is a useful NEGATIVE signal (something is untested); high coverage is NOT evidence of quality (tests can execute lines without asserting intent) — NEVER fail a build on a line-coverage %. The real test-strength metric is **mutation score** (inject faults into changed code; surviving mutant = a missing/weak assertion = write the killing test); gate the build on it where a mutation tool exists. Add **property coverage** as a second sensor — each [HARD] §4 rule / §5 invariant guarded by ≥1 property/metamorphic test. The property tests themselves are REQUIRED for invariant-owning behaviors (`spec [mode=tests]` + `integration-test` force them, not opt-in); what is optional is only wiring property coverage as an *automated CI sensor* on top. Keep **behavior/change-coverage** (does each behavior-changing file have a test that asserts the changed outcome) — that notion is meaningful and stays.
>
> **Three harness types:**
>
> 1. **Maintainability** — Complexity, duplication, line-coverage (diagnostic only — never a gate), style. Easiest: rich deterministic tooling.
> 2. **Architecture fitness** — Module boundaries, dependency direction, performance budgets, observability conventions.
> 3. **Behaviour** — Functional correctness. Hardest: gate on mutation score + property coverage; line coverage stays a diagnostic.
>
> **Keep quality left:** pre-commit sensors fire first (cheap), CI sensors fire second, post-review last (expensive).
>
> **Research-driven:** Never hardcode tool choices. Detect tech stack → research ecosystem → present top 2-3 options → user decides. Enforce strictest defaults; loosen only with explicit approval.
>
> **Harnessability signals:** Strong typing, explicit module boundaries, opinionated frameworks = easier to harness. Treat these as greenfield architectural choices, not just style preferences.

<!-- /SYNC:harness-setup -->

<!-- SYNC:ai-mistake-prevention -->

> **AI Mistake Prevention** — Failure modes to avoid on every task:
>
> **Re-read files after context changes.** Context compaction, resume, or long-running work can make memory stale; verify current files before acting.
> **Verify generated content against source evidence.** AI hallucinates APIs, names, claims, and document facts. Check the relevant source before documenting or referencing.
> **Check downstream references before deleting or renaming.** Removing an artifact can stale docs, generated mirrors, configs, and callers; map references first.
> **Trace the full impact chain after edits.** Changing a definition can miss derived outputs and consumers. Follow the affected chain before declaring done.
> **Verify ALL affected outputs, not just the first.** One green check is not all green checks; validate every output surface the change can affect.
> **Assume existing values are intentional — ask WHY before changing OR flagging one as a defect.** Before changing or reporting a constant, limit, flag, cutoff, wording, or pattern, read nearby context and history, the CALLER's ordering, and 2+ sibling call sites of the same convention. A doc stating WHAT without WHY is missing rationale, not proof of a missing guard.
> **Surface ambiguity before acting — don't pick silently.** Multiple valid interpretations require an explicit question or stated assumption with risk.
> **Assert the outcome your system owns, not the intermediate state your infrastructure owns.** When verifying async work, assert the final business state — never the delivery/retry bookkeeping held in shared infrastructure that any co-running process can write. Such a check passes when run alone and flakes the moment anything else shares that infrastructure.
> **Keep shared guidance role-relevant.** Universal guidance must help every receiving skill or agent; code-specific obligations belong only in code-specific protocols.

<!-- /SYNC:ai-mistake-prevention -->

<!-- SYNC:test-architecture-execution-contract -->

> **Test Architecture & Execution Contract** — Treat testability as a setup/architecture acceptance condition. For every potentially applicable tier — Unit, Integration/System, and E2E — record `APPLICABLE` only with evidence of its runner/framework/configuration; otherwise record `N/A — <evidence>` and never fabricate coverage.
>
> 1. **Matrix before implementation:** Record applicability, owner, runner/framework, test root, fixture/data strategy, full command, focused/partial command, zero-match behavior, CI gate, and a simple/Windows entry point (a `.cmd` when the project needs one).
> 2. **Runnable scopes:** Full and focused commands must be copy-ready, fail on invalid or zero-match selections, report exact counts and exit status, and be safe to repeat. E2E uses only configured browser/service commands.
> 3. **Fresh valid state:** Each run/test owns a unique run identity and business-data suffix, arranges through supported public paths, and uses realistic valid data. Reference setup is count-before-create, idempotent, and restart-safe. Intentional accumulation is additive, keyed, and integrity-checked; never hide contamination with destructive reset.
>    Run-scoped cleanup, when supported, is opt-in and idempotent: after evidence capture it may remove only ephemeral resources owned by the current run; it must never delete persistent/additive data or another run's data, reset shared state, or replace no-reset proof.
> 4. **Isolation and fidelity:** Isolate mutable roots and parallel workers; share only immutable/reference data. Preserve real actor pacing and observable arrange barriers. Do not widen retries or weaken assertions to make a scenario pass.
> 5. **Evidence gate:** Report command, scope, identity, seed/accumulation mode, exact result, and repeat proof. For each applicable persistent-state suite, require two consecutive no-reset full runs. Treat line coverage as diagnostic only; use meaningful property/invariant, mutation, change, and behavior coverage signals.
>
> **Ownership:** Architecture/harness defines the matrix; scaffold/workflow makes it runnable; test writers implement tier-specific cases; reviewers verify the contract; the runner reports; seed-data owners preserve uniqueness, idempotency, realism, and accumulation integrity. Missing required evidence blocks setup completion.

<!-- SYNC:design-distinctiveness-gate -->

> **[BLOCKING] Design distinctiveness gate (`DD-1`–`DD-8`) — binds on ANY task that designs, plans, mocks up, implements, or reviews a user-facing visual surface.** Deep catalog: `.claude/docs/design-knowledge.md`. Cite findings as `DD-<clause>` + `file:line`.
>
> **Precedence (resolve in this order, never silently):** the **brief's own stated visual direction WINS outright** — including when it asks for one of the `DD-4` tells. Then the **project's design-system / SCSS / frontend-pattern docs and accepted ADRs** — a house style IS an intentional identity, and re-deciding it per feature is the incoherence this gate prevents. Then these clauses. A genuine conflict is SURFACED to the user with both sides, NEVER resolved silently.
>
> **Relationship to `UI-1.1`–`UI-9.4`:** a different question, no overlap — the 40 clauses ask _"is this usable, accessible, consistent?"_ (a measurable floor); this gate asks _"is this THIS product's interface, or the one any generator would emit for any brief?"_. A surface can pass all 40 clauses and still be a template. BOTH bind; where they touch (type scale, colour, motion timing) the clause sets the floor and this gate picks the value.
>
> - `DD-1` **Ground it in the subject matter.** Before designing, name the concrete subject, the audience, and the design's primary job — and CONFIRM with the user when the brief is silent. Distinctive choices come FROM the subject's industry, materials and vernacular; they are never taste applied on top. **Test: if the palette, type and layout would fit a different product unchanged, there is no identity yet.**
> - `DD-2` **Every choice carries a WHY.** "It's common", "it's clean", "users expect it" are not reasons. A decision with no articulable reason is a default that arrived unnoticed. Defaults hide in what feels like infrastructure — typography, navigation, data display, and TOKEN NAMES. **Token-name test: someone reading only your CSS variables should be able to guess what product this is** (`--ink`/`--parchment` evoke a world; `--gray-700`/`--surface-2` evoke a template).
> - `DD-3` **Two passes, and the review pass is mandatory.** (1a) Write a compact **design plan** — Colour (4–6 named hex values) · Type (families + roles + scale) · Layout (one-sentence prose + ASCII wireframes to compare alternatives, including alignment: left/centre/justified) · Principles (what makes THIS page unique). (1b) **BLOCKING generic test — before any code:** work through a similar prompt and see whether you arrive somewhere similar; **any part that reads like the generic default for any comparable page rather than a choice for THIS brief gets REVISED, and you state what you changed and why.** Then (2a) build the REVISED plan, (2b) critique. — why: writing a plan and going straight to code reproduces the default, because the plan came from the same patterns the code will.
> - `DD-4` **Audit every FREE axis against the generated-design tell catalog** (`[model-knowledge]`, calibration not prohibition — each trait is legitimate for SOME brief): **T1** cream `#F4F1EA` + high-contrast serif + terracotta near `#D97757` (Anthropic's own interaction accent — on a user's brief it reads specifically as a tell) · **T2** near-black + one acid-green/vermilion accent · **T3** broadsheet hairline-rule pastiche, zero radius, dense columns · **T4** the SaaS-card kit: identical rounded cards, ONE radius regardless of hierarchy, the same `rgba(0,0,0,.1)` shadow under each, gradient washes as decoration · **T5** template chrome whatever the subject: tracked-out ALL-CAPS eyebrow above every heading, meta strings joined with middle dots (`A · B · C`), `WORD — fragment` labels with a spaced em dash, tinted near-black (`#0B0B0B`/`#111`) standing in for black, monospace for small data labels, `→` appended to link/button text. **A match is a HYPOTHESIS about a missed decision, never a defect** — promote it only by naming the axis, that the brief left it free, and what the subject suggested instead.
> - `DD-5` **Typography carries the personality.** One family, or two CLEARLY distinct ones — you do NOT need separate display and body faces. Choose deliberately, not the default you would reach for on any project. Set a real scale with intentional weights, widths and spacing. When type is a headline it is an ACTIVE part of the design, not a neutral delivery vehicle. Measure under ~80 characters; serifs tolerate slightly longer lines and want slightly more line-height than sans at the same size. Hierarchy needs weight/tracking/opacity, not size alone. **Avoid the three commonest tells: accenting a single word in a headline (italic/bold/colour) · ALL CAPS labels · an eyebrow label that names the section the heading already names.**
> - `DD-6` **Structure is information, not decoration.** Outlines, borders, numbering, eyebrows, dividers and labels must encode something about the content. **Before adding numbered markers (`01 / 02 / 03`), check the content really IS a sequence** — a stepped process, timeline or ranking. For every device ask: what does this tell the reader that whitespace would not? Nothing → cut it. **Hero:** open with the most characteristic thing in the subject's world, in whatever form fits (headline, image, animation, live demo, interactive moment) — big-number-plus-small-label-plus-gradient is the DEFAULT treatment, so use it only when it is genuinely best here. **Composition:** rhythm over monotone (same card size, same gap, same density everywhere is the sound of no one deciding); proportions must say something you can articulate; one dominant focal point.
> - `DD-7` **Motion sparingly and deliberately.** Non-user-triggered motion draws attention ONLY. One orchestrated moment — a single page-load sequence or one reveal — lands better than scattered effects; **fade-and-slide-up entrances on each section and hover transitions on every card are the generic default and read as generated.** Motion that ANSWERS a person's action (opening, expanding, confirming) is welcome when it shows what changed. Honour `prefers-reduced-motion`.
> - `DD-8` **Spend boldness once, then remove one accessory.** Let ONE element be the memorable thing and keep everything around it quiet and disciplined; cut any decoration that does not serve the brief. **Critique the BUILT page, not just the plan** — composition, craft (density is a decision, not a constant), content coherence, and CSS honesty (negative margins undoing a parent's padding, `calc()` values that exist only as workarounds, absolute positioning to escape layout flow are lies; the correct answer is always simpler than the hack). Take screenshots to review where the environment supports it — a picture is worth 1000 tokens. Then ask "if they said this lacks craft, what would they point to?" and fix that. **Build the quality floor in silently** — responsive, visible keyboard focus, reduced-motion respected, measured contrast, tokens never raw hex or magic numbers — and watch CSS selector specificity, where a type-based selector (`.section`) and an element-based one (`.cta`) most often cancel each other's padding/margin.
>
> **Memory:** vary between briefs — light and dark, families, direction. NEVER converge on the same choice across generations (Space Grotesk, for example). Where the project already has a design system, tokens, or an `interface-system.md`, ADOPT and record it rather than re-deciding; write back any pattern used 2+ times with measurements worth remembering.
>
> **Skip ONLY** when the change has NO user-facing visual surface (backend-only, tooling, docs) — state that reason explicitly so the skip is auditable, not an omission.

<!-- SYNC:design-review-checklist -->

> **Front-End Design Review Checklist** — the EXECUTABLE review protocol for any artifact carrying a user-facing front-end surface. Full catalog (`A1`…`Q`, ~130 checks with failure signals and default severities): **`.claude/docs/design-review-checklist.md`**. This gate carries the protocol and the triage pass; the file carries the checks.
>
> **Applies when — and ONLY when — the change, plan, or artifact carries a user-facing front-end surface.** A back-end-only diff, a doc edit, or a config change is `N/A`: state that once and move on. NEVER run a UI review on a non-UI change to manufacture coverage. When it DOES apply, **MUST ATTENTION READ `.claude/docs/design-review-checklist.md` and work its sections** — a review that cites a check ID without opening the catalog is asserting, not checking.
>
> **`CL-1` Context before checks (§0.1).** Establish platform · primary user & expertise · primary task · success metric · constraints · review scope · available artifacts. Fewer than four known → state the gap at the top of the report and mark affected findings **low confidence** — why: a check judged against an unknown task is a guess wearing an ID.
>
> **`CL-2` Evidence or nothing (§0.2).** Every finding cites a specific location (screen · element · `file:line`). NEVER invent a measurement — contrast, tap-target size, and load time that cannot be measured from the given artifact are `NOT VERIFIABLE`, never a guessed number. Tag every finding `MEASURED` · `OBSERVED` · `HEURISTIC`. Status values: `PASS` · `FAIL` · `PARTIAL` · `N/A` · `NOT VERIFIABLE`.
>
> **`CL-3` Severity, then a cap (§0.3).** `P0` blocks task completion / loses data / excludes a protected group (ship blocker) · `P1` significant friction or a legal accessibility floor (fix before release) · `P2` measurable inefficiency (next iteration) · `P3` polish (backlog) · `P4` note. Cap the report at the top 10 by severity unless a full audit was requested. A clean section reports "no issues found" — NEVER pad. Every `P0`/`P1` carries a concrete fix.
>
> **`CL-4` Section sweep, in order.** §A core usability heuristics · §B cognitive load & decision design · §C visual design & hierarchy · §D interaction + **the eight screen states** (ideal, empty, first-run, loading, partial, error, offline, maximum-data) · §E information architecture · **§F web / §G mobile / §H desktop — conditional on platform** · §I accessibility (WCAG 2.2 AA; every item `P1` minimum, `P0` when it blocks the task) · §J content & UX writing · §K trust, ethics & privacy (dark patterns are `P0`) · **§L AI & agentic patterns — conditional on the product having AI features** · §M cross-cutting consistency · §N edge-case probes. One focused pass per section — why: a section skipped in the long middle silently becomes an unreported defect class.
>
> **`CL-5` Quick Triage Pass (§P)** when a full sweep is not possible — these 10 catch the majority of serious defects: (1) can a new user complete the primary task unaided · (2) does every action give visible feedback within 400ms · (3) do empty/loading/error states exist AND offer a forward path · (4) is the primary action obvious, singular, reachable · (5) text ≥4.5:1 contrast and focus visible · (6) whole flow completable by keyboard · (7) touch targets ≥44/48px · (8) destructive actions reversible · (9) holds at 320px and 200% zoom · (10) any dark patterns.
>
> **`CL-6` Report shape (§O).** Context (+ known gaps) → Verdict (Ship / Ship with fixes / Do not ship) → What works (2–4 specific strengths, cited) → Findings grouped `P0`→`P3`, each with Location · Evidence + tag · Impact · Principle (checklist ID) · Fix → Open questions → Coverage table. Any `P0` caps the grade at Fail regardless of score; report a score only ALONGSIDE findings, never instead of them.
>
> **Precedence and no-double-counting.** The project's design-system / SCSS / frontend-pattern docs and accepted ADRs OUTRANK this checklist; the brief's stated direction outranks aesthetic judgment. A deliberate, documented convention is NEVER a defect — check intent before flagging, and surface a genuine conflict to the user with both sides, NEVER resolve it silently. This checklist is the review PROCEDURE, not a third set of taste rules: `UI-1.1`–`UI-9.4` ask "does it meet the usability floor?", `DD-1`–`DD-8` ask "is this THIS product's interface?", and these checks ask "did the review actually look, with evidence, and rank it?". Where a check restates a `UI-*` or `DD-*` clause, report the defect ONCE under whichever ID the consuming skill already uses.
>
> **For a PLAN or a PLAN REVIEW.** When the plan contains front-end work, the checklist binds the plan's ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA, not a built page: name the platform, the applicable conditional sections (§F/§G/§H, §L), the eight screen states each UI phase must deliver (§D2), and the §I accessibility floor — so the work is specified against the checklist before it is written. A UI phase whose acceptance criteria omit the states and the a11y floor is INCOMPLETE — say so.

## Closing Reminders

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** Testability contract: resolve evidence-backed Unit/Integration/System/E2E rows, copy-ready full/focused commands, zero-match failures, owner/root/data, CI/simple-Windows entry, unique run identity, and repeat proof before claiming setup, review, or test completion.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION Goal:** Produce a copy-ready, OOP/SOLID-compliant architecture foundation — base classes, infrastructure abstractions, and quality-gate tooling — that every feature story reuses before implementation starts.

**MUST ATTENTION — Main steps (execute ALL, in order; AI keeps forgetting these):** (1) Read Plan → (2) Generate Scaffolding Checklist (Backend + Frontend/UI categories) → (3) Validate Against Plan → (4) Present to User by asking the user directly → (5) Scaffold base classes/interfaces/infra + 5 production-readiness foundations → (6) Verify (build + OOP/SOLID + Verification Gate) → invoke `$linter-setup` → `$harness-setup` → ask the user directly handoff. NEVER skip, reorder, or merge a step without explicit user approval.

**MUST ATTENTION — Protocols in force (concise digest of the SYNC/shared blocks this skill carries):**

- **Nested Task Creation:** Expand child phases; link parent when nested.
- **Project Reference Docs Guide:** Read required project docs; ALWAYS include `lessons.md`.
- **Critical Thinking Mindset:** Traced proof per claim; confidence >80% to act.
- **Understand Code First:** Grep 3+ patterns, read code before modifying.
- **Scaffold Production Readiness:** Verify 5 foundations before scaffold complete.
- **Harness Setup:** Gate on mutation score; NEVER gate on line coverage.
- **AI Mistake Prevention:** verify generated content against evidence, trace downstream references, verify all affected outputs, re-read after context loss, surface ambiguity.

**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** check Activation Guards FIRST — proceed ONLY in `workflow-greenfield-init`/`workflow-big-feature` AND when grep finds NO existing base/abstract/infrastructure scaffolding; otherwise SKIP and mark step completed — why: re-scaffolding an established project duplicates foundations and corrupts existing abstractions.
**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** grep 3+ existing base/abstract/infra patterns (`abstract class.*Base`, `interface I\w+<`, `IRepository`, `base.*component`, DI registration) and cite `file:line` BEFORE generating any scaffolding — existing scaffolding found = SKIP — why: scaffolding over real foundations is the failure the Activation Guards exist to prevent.
**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** BLOCK `$feature-implement` until the Verification Gate passes — all 5 production-readiness foundations verified AND both `$linter-setup` and `$harness-setup` complete — why: code shipped without quality gates is technical debt from day one.
**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** delegate ALL sensor setup to `$linter-setup` then `$harness-setup` — NEVER hand-configure linters/formatters/pre-commit hooks in this skill — why: a checklist of installs is not a harness; the harness skills wire each control to its lifecycle stage.
**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** enforce OOP/SOLID on EVERY base class (SRP per concern, depend on abstractions, small focused interfaces, no unused methods subclasses must override) — why: a god/concrete base class propagates its design flaw into every feature story that inherits it.
**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** the checklists are TEMPLATES — self-investigate the chosen tech stack, adapt naming to framework conventions, skip irrelevant items, and confirm the final checklist by asking the user directly before generating code — NEVER auto-decide scope — why: scaffolding the wrong stack's idioms forces a costly rewrite before any feature lands.
**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** evaluate fit before copying a nearby pattern — closest example ≠ matching preconditions; verify the new context shares the same base classes, scope, and lifetime — why: a foundation lifted from a mismatched context fails silently.
**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** gate the build on mutation score, NOT a line-coverage % — line coverage is a DIAGNOSTIC only (low = useful untested signal, high ≠ quality) — why: tests can execute lines without asserting intent, so a coverage gate rewards hollow tests.
**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** cite `file:line` proof + confidence % for EVERY claim (>80% to act, <60% DO NOT recommend) — NEVER present a guess as fact — why: speculation without evidence is the root of hallucinated foundations.
**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** break work into small todo tasks using task tracking BEFORE starting, mark one `in_progress`, mark `completed` immediately after evidence lands, and add a final review todo — why: external task state survives context compaction; memory does not.
**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** after scaffold, present `$feature-implement` vs `$workflow-review-changes` vs skip by asking the user directly — the user decides; do NOT skip because it "seems obvious" — why: the user owns the handoff decision.

**Anti-Rationalization (Closing — reject these excuses):**

| Excuse the model tells itself                          | Reality                                                                                          |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| "It's a new feature, just scaffold it"                 | Check Activation Guards first — wrong workflow OR existing scaffolding = SKIP and mark completed.  |
| "Already searched for base classes"                    | Show `file:line` grep evidence for all 6 guard patterns. No proof = no search.                    |
| "I'll just configure the linter inline, it's quick"    | NEVER hand-configure sensors — delegate to `$linter-setup` then `$harness-setup`. Installs ≠ harness. |
| "Coverage is high, the foundation is well-tested"      | Line coverage is a diagnostic, not a gate. Gate on mutation score; high coverage ≠ asserted intent. |
| "The stack is obvious, skip the ask the user directly"       | Checklists are templates — confirm the adapted final checklist with the user before generating code. |
| "Found a nearby base class, just copy it"              | Evaluate fit first — same base classes/scope/lifetime? Closest ≠ matching. Verify before reusing.  |
| "Scaffold's done, jump straight to $feature-implement" | BLOCKED until the Verification Gate passes — all 5 foundations + `$linter-setup` + `$harness-setup`. |

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** check Activation Guards FIRST (SKIP if existing scaffolding or wrong workflow) · BLOCK `$feature-implement` until the Verification Gate passes · cite `file:line` + confidence >80% for every claim.

**[TASK-PLANNING]** Before acting, analyze task scope and systematically break it into small todo tasks and sub-tasks using task tracking.

## Hookless Prompt Protocol Mirror (Auto-Synced)

Source: `.claude/.ck.json` + `.claude/skills/shared/sync-inline-versions.md` (`:full` blocks) + `.claude/scripts/lib/hookless-prompt-protocol.cjs`

## [WORKFLOW-EXECUTION-PROTOCOL] [BLOCKING] Workflow Execution Protocol — MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST CRITICAL. Do not skip for any reason.

**Generic portability boundary:** Reusable skills and protocol text stay project-neutral; project-specific conventions are discovered from docs/project-config.json and docs/project-reference/. Apply shared AI-SDD from `shared/sdd-artifact-contract.md`. Read `docs/project-config.json` and `docs/project-reference/docs-index-reference.md`, then open the project reference docs named there. For spec, test-case, behavior-change, public-contract, or `docs/specs/` work, route through the local spec docs named by the docs index: `feature-spec-reference.md`, `spec-system-reference.md`, `spec-principles.md`, and `workflow-spec-test-code-cycle-reference.md` when specs/tests/code must stay synchronized. If either file or a required reference doc is missing or stale, auto-run `$project-init` (or the narrow lower-level route such as `$project-config`, `$docs-init`, `$scan-all`, or `$scan --target=<key>`) before ordinary project-specific work. Any supported AI tool may execute when this shared context and local docs are available.

1. **DETECT:** If the prompt starts with an explicit slash skill/workflow command, execute it directly. Otherwise match the prompt against the workflow catalog and skill list.
2. **ANALYZE:** Choose the best option: execute directly, invoke a skill, activate a standard workflow, or compose a custom step combination.
3. **AUTO-SELECT:** Pick the best option yourself. Do not ask the user to choose between direct execution, skill, standard workflow, or custom workflow.
4. **ACTIVATE:** For a selected workflow, call `$start-workflow <workflowId>`; for a selected skill, invoke that skill; for a custom workflow, sequence custom steps directly; for direct execution, proceed with the task.
5. **CREATE TASKS:** task tracking for ALL workflow/skill/custom steps before execution when the selected path has multiple steps.
6. **PARALLELIZE:** Before executing the task list, tag each task `PAR` (independent inputs + write set disjoint from every other `PAR` task) or `SEQ` (name the blocking dependency), group `PAR` tasks into waves, declare the wave plan, and spawn each wave's sub-agents in ONE message — all-return barrier per wave, fan-out one level deep unless a sub-agent's own definition authorizes further fan-out. Sequential-by-default is a defect when tasks are independent; do not parallelize shared write targets, output-consuming tasks, trivial single-file work, ordering a skill or workflow explicitly fixes, or user-approval gates.
7. **EXECUTE:** Advance per the **Workflow Step Advancement & Parallel Phases** rule in your context instructions — model-driven; a sub-agent completion advances a step identically to an inline call; a parallel-phase group is an all-return barrier (advance only after ALL members return, never serialize it)

## SYNC:ai-sdd-artifact-contract:reminder

- **MANDATORY** Apply `shared/sdd-artifact-contract.md`; keep reusable AI-SDD in `.claude` and local rules in project docs.
- **MANDATORY** Code-to-spec extraction is reference-only until canonical acceptance; any supported AI tool may execute with synced context.
- **MANDATORY** Update `.claude` source before syncing generated mirrors; do not manually edit `.agents`, `.codex`, or `AGENTS.md`.
- **MANDATORY** Missing or stale project config, root instruction files, or required reference docs route project-specific work through `$project-init` or the narrow setup route automatically.
**[TASK-PLANNING] [MANDATORY]** BEFORE executing any workflow or skill step, create/update task tracking for all planned steps, then keep it synchronized as each step starts/completes.
## [LESSON-LEARNED-REMINDER] [BLOCKING] Task Planning & Continuous Improvement — MANDATORY. Do not skip.

Break work into small tasks (task tracking) before starting. Add final task: "Analyze AI mistakes & lessons learned".

**Extract lessons — ROOT CAUSE ONLY, not symptom fixes:**
1. Name the FAILURE MODE (reasoning/assumption failure), not symptom — "assumed API existed without reading source" not "used wrong enum value".
2. Generality test: does this failure mode apply to ≥3 contexts/codebases? If not, abstract one level up.
3. Write as a universal rule — strip project-specific names/paths/classes. Useful on any codebase.
4. Consolidate: multiple mistakes sharing one failure mode → ONE lesson.
5. **Recurrence gate:** "Would this recur in future session WITHOUT this reminder?" — No → skip `$learn`.
6. **Auto-fix gate:** "Could `$code-review`/`$code-simplifier`/`$security-review`/`$lint` catch this?" — Yes → improve review skill instead.
7. BOTH gates pass → ask user to run `$learn`.
**[CRITICAL-THINKING-MINDSET]** Apply critical thinking, sequential thinking. Every claim needs traced proof, confidence >80% to act.
**Anti-hallucination principle:** Never present guess as fact — cite sources for every claim, admit uncertainty freely, self-check output for errors, cross-reference independently, stay skeptical of own confidence — certainty without evidence root of all hallucination.
**AI Attention principle (Primacy-Recency):** Put the 3 most critical rules at both top and bottom of long prompts/protocols so instruction adherence survives long context windows.
**Goal-driven execution:** Define success criteria first, loop until verified, and stop only when observable checks pass.
**Tests verify intent:** Tests must protect business rules/invariants and fail when the protected intent breaks, not only mirror current behavior.
## Common AI Mistake Prevention (System Lessons)

- **Re-read files after context compaction.** Edit requires prior Read in same context; compaction wipes read state. Re-read before editing.
- **Grep for old terms after bulk replacements.** AI over-trusts find/replace completeness. Grep full repo after bulk edits for missed refs in docs/configs/catalogs.
- **Check downstream references before deleting.** Deletions cascade doc/code staleness. Map referencing files before removal.
- **After memory loss, check existing state before creating new.** Compaction wipes prior-work memory. Query current state to resume — never blindly duplicate.
- **Verify AI-generated content against actual code.** AI hallucinates APIs, class names, method signatures. Grep to confirm existence before documenting/referencing.
- **Trace full dependency chain after edits.** Changing a definition misses downstream consumers. Trace the full chain.
- **When renaming, grep ALL consumer file types.** Some file types silently ignore missing refs (no compile error). Search code, templates, configs, generated files.
- **Trace ALL code paths when verifying correctness.** Code existing ≠ code executing. Trace early exits, error branches, conditional skips — not just happy path.
- **Update docs that embed canonical data when source changes.** Docs inlining derived data (workflows, schemas, configs) go stale silently. Update all embedding docs alongside source.
- **Verify sub-agent results after context recovery.** Background agents may finish while parent compacted — grep-verify output, don't trust assumed completion.
- **Cross-check full target list against sub-agent assignments.** Parallel sub-agents by category miss boundary items. Reconcile union of assignments against target list before proceeding.
- **Sub-agents inherit knowledge only from their agent .md definition — use custom agent types, not built-in Explore.** Tool adoption = permission + knowledge + enforcement (numbered workflow step).
- **Persist sub-agent findings incrementally, not as a final batch.** Long sub-agents hit cutoffs before final write — findings lost. Instruct append-per-section to report file.
- **When debugging, ask "whose responsibility?" before fixing.** Trace caller (wrong data) vs callee (wrong handling). Fix at responsible layer — never patch symptom site.
- **Test failure → record a provisional verdict before trace/edit, then investigate.** Use the full five-way taxonomy: SOURCE-WRONG (production violates intent), TEST-WRONG (assertion/setup is stale), TEST-NOT-OPTIMAL (valid but fragile or low-signal test), ENVIRONMENT-BLOCKED (external state prevents a verdict), or AMBIGUOUS (intent/evidence cannot choose safely). Then trace root cause and triangulate against the governing spec (`docs/specs/**` if one exists) AND source. NEVER weaken an assertion, add a skip, relax a timeout, or change source merely to force green.
- **Grep ALL removed names after extraction/refactoring.** Primary file "done" ≠ secondary files clean. Grep entire scope for every removed symbol before declaring complete.
- **Assume existing values are intentional — ask WHY before changing OR flagging one as a defect.** Pattern-matching as "wrong" skips context. Before changing or reporting any constant/limit/flag/cutoff: read comments, git blame, the CALLER's ordering (the guarantee that makes the value correct usually lives in code running immediately BEFORE the cited line), and 2+ sibling call sites of the same convention. A doc stating WHAT without WHY is missing rationale, not proof of a missing guard — and in a validation pass, an accurate `file:line` citation proves the transcription, never the defect.
- **Verify ALL affected outputs, not just the first.** One build green ≠ all green. Multi-stack changes (backend/frontend/tests/docs) require verifying EVERY output.
- **Evaluate fit before copying a nearby pattern.** Closest example ≠ matching preconditions — verify the new context shares the same constraints, base classes, scope, lifetime.
- **Holistic-first debugging — resist nearest-attention trap.** Don't dive into first plausible cause. List EVERY precondition (config, env vars, paths, DB, endpoints, creds, versions, DI, data). Verify each against evidence (grep/query — not reasoning). Ask "what would falsify this?" — if nothing, it's not a hypothesis. Most expensive failure: going deeper in "obvious" layer while bug sits in layer never questioned.
- **Surgical changes — apply the diff test (context-aware).** Two modes: (1) Bug fix → every line traces to the bug; no restyling; orphan cleanup only for imports YOUR changes made unused. (2) Review/enhancement → implement improvements AND announce as "Enhancement beyond main request: [what]". Never silently scope-creep. Diff test: "Would this line exist if I wasn't asked to do X?" — if no, delete or announce.
- **Surface ambiguity before coding — don't pick silently.** Multiple valid interpretations → present each with effort: "[Request] could mean (1) [N h], (2) [N h]. Which matters?" List scope/format/volume/constraints assumptions first. If simpler path exists, say so. Never silently pick.
- **[MANDATORY FIRST ACTION] ALWAYS activate a suitable skill or workflow BEFORE responding.** Match task against workflow catalog + skill list; invoke via skill invocation or `$start-workflow <workflowId>`. NEVER answer or write code before checking. Skip = protocol violation.
- **Why-Review adversarial mindset — apply when reviewing any plan, decision, or design.** Default SKEPTIC not VALIDATOR: steel-man a rejected alternative, invert each stated reason ("what does it sacrifice?"), stress-test top 2-3 assumptions, run pre-mortem ("ships, fails in 3 months — what breaks?"), surface 1-2 alternatives author missed. Section presence ≠ quality; quality = causal reasoning + concrete mitigations + evidence, not "it's better" or "monitor closely".
- **Front-load report-write in sub-agent prompts for large reviews.** Many-file sub-agents hit budget before final write — findings lost. Design prompts so: (1) report-write is first explicit deliverable, (2) append per-file/section (not batched), (3) scope bounded so reads don't exhaust budget. Truncated mid-sentence with no report file → spawn narrower scope, don't retry same prompt.
- **After context compaction, re-verify all prior phase outcomes before continuing.** Summaries describe intent, not environment state (git index, filesystem, processes). On resume, FIRST audit: git status, re-read modified files, verify filesystem. Every "completed" claim is an untested hypothesis until evidence confirms.
- **OOM/memory: check row count before row size.** Triage: (1) Unbounded query — no DB filter for trigger? Push filter to DB; eliminates OOM. (2) Large rows? Projection reduces proportionally. Row reduction > projection in ROI.
- **Assert the outcome your system OWNS, never the intermediate state your INFRASTRUCTURE owns.** When testing anything asynchronous (queue/broker delivery, retries, background jobs, caches, replication), assert the final business/entity state. NEVER assert the delivery bookkeeping — consume/send status, attempt counts, last-error, row existence or counts in a broker, scheduler, or outbox/inbox table. That bookkeeping lives in shared infrastructure that ANY co-running process (a peer worker, a second replica, a leftover local container) can write, usually under a deterministic shared key, so the assertion silently tests the developer's environment instead of the system: green when run alone, flaky the instant anything else shares that broker + database. Gate question for every assertion: "would this hold no matter WHICH process did the work?" — if no, assert the converged data state instead. Corollary: process-local fault injection and in-process telemetry cannot gate work any process may perform — use them as stress amplifiers (arm → bounded window → disarm → assert convergence), never as preconditions.
- **Keep domain concepts out of generic/shared/infrastructure layers.** Reusable layer (shared library, framework, infra module) must reference NO consumer-specific domain concept — tenant/customer/product IDs, business entities, feature rules. Leak compiles + runs → passes review silently while coupling the "reusable" layer to one consumer. Keep shared type domain-free; push domain fields/logic down into the consumer via subclass/composition. — why: a layer coupled to one consumer's domain is no longer reusable.
