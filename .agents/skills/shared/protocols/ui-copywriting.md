> **Words are design content, not decoration** — binds whenever a task authors, changes, or reviews user-visible strings (labels, CTAs, headings, empty/error/loading text, toasts, placeholder content). Deep detail: `.claude/docs/design-knowledge.md` §8. Copy makes a design feel as templated as the visuals do.

> Before writing anything, ask what the design needs to SAY and how it can best be said to help the person navigate the experience. Then:
>
> 1. **Write from the end user's perspective.** Name things by what users will understand in simple language, not by how the system is built — a user manages **notifications**, not **webhook config**. Describe what something is or does in plain terms rather than selling it. Being specific and legible to a new user ALWAYS beats being clever.
> 2. **Active voice by default.** A CTA says exactly what happens when it is used: **"Save changes"**, NEVER "Submit".
> 3. **One name per action, across the whole flow.** The button that says **Publish** produces a toast that says **Published**. The vocabulary of an interface is the signposting for someone navigating the product — cohesion and consistency are how people learn their way around.
> 4. **Failure and emptiness give DIRECTION, not mood.** Explain what went wrong and how to fix it, in the interface's voice rather than a person's. **Errors do NOT apologize, and are NEVER vague about what happened.** An empty screen is an invitation to act.
> 5. **Conversational tone, one job per element.** Plain verbs, sentence case, no filler, tone matched to the brand and the audience; let each written element do exactly one job.
> 6. **Real content, never lorem.** When the brief supplies no copy, write plausible strings for the ACTUAL subject. **Coherence check — read every visible string as a user would, checking for truth, not typos:** could a real person at a real company be looking at exactly this data right now, or does the page title belong to one product, the body to another, and the sidebar metrics to a third? A beautifully designed interface with nonsensical content is a movie set with no script.
>
> **Skip ONLY** when the change surfaces no user-visible text — state that explicitly.
