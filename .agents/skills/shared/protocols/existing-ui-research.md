> **[BLOCKING] Understand the existing UI before you design or spec a new/updated screen.** Before producing any wireframe, mockup, screen design, or UI spec:
>
> 1. **Inventory existing related UI** — search the project for screens, pages, and components already serving this feature or its domain (consult configured design-system docs + the real component inventory).
>    Use the project's documented component tiers and base abstractions when present; otherwise record the actual component roles and owners without inventing a tier model.
> 2. **Map connected flows** — identify every feature that links to, embeds, includes, or navigates to/from the new screen; trace its entry and exit flows so the new screen fits them.
> 3. **Reuse before invent** — prefer composing an existing component when its contract fits; justify any new component or variant against the inventory and record the constraint that prevents reuse.
>    Avoid duplicated behavior where a suitable project abstraction exists; do not create a base, tier, selector convention, or shared component solely to match this checklist.
> 4. **Record findings** — note the matched existing screens/components + connected flows in the artifact so downstream design faithfully matches the current UI system.
>
> **Skip ONLY** when the feature is backend-only (no UI) — state that explicitly.
