> **Parallel-Phase Advancement (model-driven)** — How to run AND advance a declared parallel batch of workflow steps. Tool-agnostic: identical under Claude and Codex — neither depends on a hook. Mirrors the universal context-file rule ("Workflow Step Advancement & Parallel Phases" in CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md).
>
> 1. **Declare the group.** Name the members of the parallel phase up-front — which steps run together, and mark any conditional member with its trigger.
> 2. **Spawn ALL members in ONE message.** Dispatch every member together (multiple `spawn_agent`/sub-agent calls in a single response) — never drip them one per turn.
> 3. **Barrier — advance ONLY after EVERY member returns.** A member is "returned" when its work completes inline OR its sub-agent returns; a conditional member whose trigger is absent counts as returned. Do NOT advance, and do NOT start the next step, until the whole group has returned.
> 4. **A sub-agent return advances the step identically to an inline call.** Advancement is YOUR judgment against the task list — never wait for a hook or tool event. Mark each member `completed` (or "Skipped — <reason>") as the batch resolves.
> 5. **Mutating steps wait for the barrier.** Never start a code-mutating step (e.g. `code-simplifier`) until the full batch has returned — it must act on the complete review snapshot, not a partial one.
> 6. **Hooks are accelerators only.** Any step-tracking hook may emit a "next step" hint as an optimization; correctness MUST NOT depend on it. Claude and Codex both advance from this static rule when hooks are absent, disabled, or stale.
>
> **Blocked until:** `- [ ]` all members spawned in one message `- [ ]` every member returned (incl. skipped conditional) `- [ ]` each member marked completed/skipped `- [ ]` mutating step deferred until after the barrier.
