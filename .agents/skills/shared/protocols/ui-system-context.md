> **UI System Context** — Apply only when the changed artifact is part of a user-interface surface; a `.ts`, `.html`, `.scss`, or `.css` extension alone does not establish that.
>
> 1. Resolve applicable UI paths and conventions from `docs/project-config.json`, its configured project-reference docs, accepted decisions, and existing code. Read only references relevant to this surface (frontend patterns, styling, component system, design system, accessibility, or platform guide).
> 2. Respect an explicit N/A or absent UI surface. Do not require BEM, SCSS, tokens, component tiers, base classes, stores, API wrappers, or teardown helpers unless this project documents or demonstrates them.
> 3. Follow the configured/observed styling and component conventions. Use `componentSystem.layerClassification` when configured; otherwise describe the actual component owners without inventing Common/Domain-Shared/Page tiers.
> 4. Reuse or compose an existing abstraction when its contract and platform fit. When none fits, use the project's idiomatic local pattern; do not add a shared base or wrapper just to satisfy this checklist.
>
> Project config may customize these conventions through `contextGroups[].rules`, `workflowPatterns`, `styling`, `componentSystem`, and the configured reference docs.
