## Codex Project-Reference Loading (No Hooks)

Codex uses static project-reference loading instead of runtime-injected project docs.
When coding, planning, debugging, testing, or reviewing, open project docs explicitly using this routing.

**Always read:**
- `docs/project-config.json` (project-specific paths, commands, modules, and workflow/test settings)
- `docs/project-reference/docs-index-reference.md` (routes to the full `docs/project-reference/*` catalog)
- `docs/project-reference/lessons.md` (always-on guardrails and anti-patterns)

**Missing/stale context route:** If `docs/project-config.json`, the docs index, `lessons.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, or any task-required reference doc is missing or stale, auto-run `$project-init` or the narrow setup route (`$project-config`, `$docs-init`, `$scan-all`, `$scan --target=<key>`, `$claude-md-init`) before ordinary project-specific work. If Codex mirrors or `AGENTS.md` are missing/stale, ask the user to run `$sync-codex`; do not auto-run it.

**Situation-based docs:**
- Project structure/architecture/tech-stack/deployment/setup (any layer — backend, frontend, or infra): `project-structure-reference.md`
- Backend/CQRS/API/domain/entity changes: `backend-patterns-reference.md`, `domain-entities-reference.md`
- Frontend/UI/styling/design-system: `frontend-patterns-reference.md`, `scss-styling-guide.md`, `design-system/README.md`
- Spec authoring, `docs/specs/` pathing, or TC format: `feature-spec-reference.md`, `spec-system-reference.md`, `spec-principles.md`
- Behavior/public-contract changes or spec-test-code sync: `workflow-spec-test-code-cycle-reference.md` plus the spec docs above
- Derived spec indexes/ERDs/reimplementation guides: `spec-system-reference.md` and source Feature Specs under `docs/specs/`
- Integration test implementation/review: `integration-test-reference.md`
- E2E test implementation/review: `e2e-test-reference.md`
- Code review/audit work: `code-review-rules.md` plus domain docs above based on changed files

Do not read all docs blindly. Start from `docs-index-reference.md`, then open only relevant files for the task.

## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Produce a structured, tech-agnostic UI/UX design specification from a requirement/PBI/story/wireframe so a developer can rebuild the UI on ANY stack — every component, state, design token, responsive rule, and accessibility need documented and linked back to the governing Feature Spec.

**Summary:**

- **Purpose** — translate requirements into a developer-ready UI/UX spec (component inventory, states, design tokens, responsive behavior, accessibility), tech-agnostic: name components by UX role, never by framework/library class.
- **Step 0–0b — research first:** inventory existing related screens/components + map connected flows, record in §1 so the spec matches the live UI system; if a governing Feature Spec exists, seed from its §6 interaction surface and reuse its view + observable-state vocabulary verbatim. — why: divergent vocabulary breaks the navigable spec↔design hub.
- **Step 1–2 — read & route input, set complexity:** Figma URL → `$figma-design`; image/screenshot → visual analysis tooling; wireframe/sketch → `--mode=wireframe`; PBI/text → extract requirements. Pick Quick Spec (§1–4) vs Full Spec (§1–7, +Flow Diagram for multi-page).
- **Step 3–6 — author the body:** build component inventory (new vs existing), define all 7 states + interactions, extract design tokens (reuse design-system), document responsive breakpoints (mobile 320–767 / tablet 768–1023 / desktop 1024+).
- For a UI PBI, preserve the parent releasable outcome's complete surface: every required page/view, navigation path, common/domain/page component, applicable state, and end-to-end demo journey. Multi-page outcomes require Full Spec + Flow Diagram; do not collapse them into one screen.
- **Step 7–8 — save & link back:** write the artifact to `team-artifacts/design-specs/`, then set the governing Feature Spec's `design_spec:`/`mockup:` frontmatter to the saved path — frontmatter only, never the §1–8 body. — why: `artifact-review --type=design` fails if the path is not recorded.

**Workflow:**

1. **Read Source** — Extract UI requirements from PBI, story, or Figma URL
2. **Determine Complexity** — Quick Spec (sections 1-4) vs Full Spec (all 7 sections)
3. **Build Component Inventory** — List new vs existing components
4. **Define States & Tokens** — Interactions, design tokens, responsive breakpoints
5. **Save Artifact** — Output to `team-artifacts/design-specs/`

**Key Rules:**

- If Figma URL provided → auto-routes to `$figma-design` for context extraction
- If wireframe image provided (hand-drawn/digital/tool-export) → handled internally via `--mode=wireframe` (see "Mode: wireframe" below)
- If screenshot provided → uses `visual analysis tooling` for design extraction
- Reference existing design system tokens from `docs/project-reference/design-system/`
- Component patterns: `docs/project-reference/frontend-patterns-reference.md`
- Include accessibility requirements (keyboard nav, ARIA labels, contrast)
- **[BLOCKING] Tech-agnostic output:** spec prose/headings follow `docs/project-reference/spec-principles.md` §3 — describe components by UX role, not framework/library names; source paths and class names appear ONLY in evidence fields (`**Evidence**`, `[Source:]`), frontmatter, and Mermaid.
- **[BLOCKING] Releasable UI surface:** apply `.claude/skills/shared/releasable-pbi-contract.md`; the design spec must deepen, not reduce, the PBI/mockup page/view, navigation, component, state, and full-flow inventories.

**Be skeptical. Apply critical thinking, sequential thinking. Every claim needs traced proof, confidence percentages (Idea should be more than 80%).**

# Design Specification

Create structured UI/UX design specification documents from requirements or PBIs for developer handoff.

## When to Use

- A PBI or user story needs a design spec before implementation
- Translating requirements into concrete UI layout, states, and tokens
- Documenting component inventory and interaction patterns
- Creating responsive breakpoint specifications

## When NOT to Use

- This skill auto-routes Figma URLs to `$figma-design`; wireframes are handled internally via `--mode=wireframe` — no need to call a separate skill
- Building the actual UI -- use `design --lane=marketing` (marketing/creative) or `design --lane=product` (product UIs)
- Reviewing existing UI code -- use `web-design-guidelines`

## Prerequisites

Read before executing:

- The source PBI, user story, or requirements document
- `docs/project-reference/design-system/` -- project design tokens (if applicable)
- Existing design specs in `team-artifacts/design-specs/` for format consistency

### Frontend/UI Context

> When this task involves frontend or UI changes,

- Frontend patterns: `docs/project-reference/frontend-patterns-reference.md`
- Styling/BEM guide: `docs/project-reference/scss-styling-guide.md`
- Design system tokens: `docs/project-reference/design-system/README.md`

## Workflow

> **[BLOCKING] Step 0 — Inventory existing UI + map connected flows** (per the `SYNC:existing-ui-research` protocol carried by this skill). Before authoring the spec, inventory the existing related screens / components / pages already serving this feature or domain, and map every connected feature flow that links to / embeds / navigates to-or-from the new screen. Record the matched screens + flows in §1 Overview so the spec faithfully matches the current UI system. Skip only for backend-only work (state it explicitly).

> **[BLOCKING] Step 0b — Seed from the governing Feature Spec's §6 interaction surface (when one exists).** Detect whether a canonical Feature Spec already governs this feature (look under `docs/specs/**` for a spec covering the same capability). If one exists, READ its **§6 Process Flows & Interaction Surface** — the **View Inventory** (§6.2), **Navigation Map** (§6.3), **Key UI States** (§6.4), and **Per-Story Interaction Flow** (§6.5) — and use it as this design-spec's starting frame:
>
> - **Reuse the spec's vocabulary verbatim** — carry over the SAME UX-role view names from §6.2 and the SAME observable-state names from §6.4 (the Default / Loading / Disabled / Error / Empty / Success vocabulary in this skill's "Observable State Definitions" table is the shared language). NEVER rename or re-partition what the spec already named — the two artifacts MUST speak the same language or the navigable hub breaks.
> - **Deepen, do not diverge or contradict.** The spec stays tech-agnostic; this design-spec is the companion that adds visual fidelity (layout, tokens, pixel detail) ON TOP of the spec's intent. Map each §6.5 step and each §6.4 state into concrete visual treatment, preserving the `US-`/`OP-`/`BR-` logical-ID cross-refs the spec already owns.
> - This coupling is the `SYNC:ui-intent-layer` contract carried below — see that block for the full rule; do not restate it here.
>
> **Skip ONLY** when no governing Feature Spec exists (author the interaction frame from the source PBI/story instead) — state which case applies.

1. **Read source input & route by type**

    | Input Detected           | Detection                                      | Action                                                                   |
    | ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
    | Figma URL                | `figma.com/design` or `figma.com/file` in text | Activate `$figma-design` to extract context, then continue               |
    | Image/screenshot         | Image file attached to prompt                  | Use `visual analysis tooling` to extract design guidelines, then continue          |
    | Hand-drawn wireframe     | Image + "wireframe"/"sketch" keyword           | Run `--mode=wireframe` (internal — see "Mode: wireframe" section)         |
    | PBI/story text           | Acceptance criteria present                    | Extract UI requirements from text, continue                              |
    | Verbal/text requirements | No image, no URL, no PBI                       | Clarify with user, then continue                                         |

For ANY visual input: extract design context FIRST, then proceed to spec generation.

2. **Determine spec complexity**

    ```
    IF single form or simple component → Quick Spec (sections 1-4 only)
    IF full page or multi-component view → Full Spec (all 7 sections)
    IF multi-page flow → Full Spec + Flow Diagram
    ```

3. **Build component inventory**
    - List all UI components needed
    - Identify reusable vs feature-specific components
    - Note existing components from shared component library or design system

4. **Define states and interactions**
    - Default, hover, active, disabled, error, loading, empty states
    - User interactions (click, drag, keyboard shortcuts)
    - Transitions and animations

5. **Extract design tokens**
    - Colors, typography, spacing, shadows, border-radius
    - Reference existing design system tokens where possible

6. **Document responsive behavior**
    - Mobile (320-767px), Tablet (768-1023px), Desktop (1024px+)
    - What changes at each breakpoint (layout, visibility, sizing)
    - **Small-screen minimum bar (spec it explicitly):** the layout MUST stay usable on mobile. Preferred = reflow (rows `flex-wrap` / `row → column`, grids collapse to one column). Where a component genuinely can't reflow (data tables, canvases, wide grids), specify a `min-width`/`min-height` + `overflow: auto` scroll as the accepted fallback — scrolling is OK. Hard requirement = nothing broken (no clipped, cut-off, or unreachable content/controls). If a component needs a large redesign to work on mobile, flag it for the user rather than assuming a rewrite.

7. **Save artifact** — pick the filename variant by artifact type:
    - Design spec: `team-artifacts/design-specs/{YYMMDD}-designspec-{feature-slug}.md`
    - Accessibility audit: `team-artifacts/design-specs/{YYMMDD}-ux-audit-{feature-slug}.md`
    - Single-component doc: `team-artifacts/design-specs/{YYMMDD}-ux-component-{component-name}.md`

8. **Link back to the governing Feature Spec (when one exists).** After saving the artifact, keep the spec the navigable hub: open the governing Feature Spec under `docs/specs/**` and set its frontmatter `design_spec:` key to this design-spec's saved path (add the key if absent, update it if stale). If a mockup was also produced (e.g. via `$pbi-mockup`), set the `mockup:` key the same way. Edit **frontmatter only** — never touch the §1–§8 spec body. This satisfies the `artifact-review --type=design` link-back gate, which fails when a design-spec exists but its path is not recorded in the spec's `design_spec:` frontmatter. Skip ONLY when no governing Feature Spec exists (the design-spec is standalone) — state that.

### Role Context & Artifact Path (canonical)

> Applies to Writes under `team-artifacts/design-specs/`.

- **Active Role:** ui-ux-designer · **Skill:** design-spec
- **Path:** `team-artifacts/design-specs/` · **Type:** designspec · **Role token:** ux
- **Template:** `.claude/docs/team-artifacts/templates/design-spec-template.md`
- **Naming:** `{YYMMDD}-ux-{type}-{slug}.md` (general artifact-path pattern: `{YYMMDD}-{role}-{type}-{slug}.md`)
- **Context:** DESIGN SPEC — include component states, design tokens, accessibility requirements.
- **Quality checklist:** `- [ ]` All states documented · `- [ ]` Design tokens specified · `- [ ]` Accessibility notes included · `- [ ]` Responsive breakpoints defined

## Mode: wireframe (image → spec)

> **Invoke with `--mode=wireframe`** (or whenever a hand-drawn wireframe, digital wireframe, or UI sketch is the input). This mode is an INPUT adapter: it analyzes the image, then flows into the normal spec sections (Output Format) and the M1-M5/M7 compliance gate. `design-spec` is the canonical owner of wireframe→spec conversion.

### Input Routing (wireframe)

| Input                   | Detection                               | Action                                       |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Hand-drawn sketch photo | Image with rough/organic lines          | Analyze with wireframe prompts (this mode)   |
| Digital wireframe       | Image with clean lines/shapes           | Analyze with wireframe prompts (this mode)   |
| Wireframe tool export   | Image from Excalidraw/Balsamiq/MockFlow | Analyze with wireframe prompts (this mode)   |
| Figma URL               | `figma.com` in text                     | Route to `$figma-design` instead             |
| App screenshot          | Polished UI with real data              | Route to `$design --mode=screenshot` instead |

### Wireframe Analysis

Use `visual analysis tooling` with these prompts:

**Prompt 1: Layout Extraction** — "Analyze this wireframe image. Identify: (1) page layout regions (header, sidebar, main, footer), (2) all UI elements with approximate position and type (button, input, table, card, dropdown, modal, tabs), (3) content hierarchy (what is primary vs secondary), (4) interactive elements, (5) any text labels or annotations, (6) navigation patterns."

**Prompt 2: Component Identification** — "From the wireframe, list every distinct UI component. For each: name it descriptively, classify its complexity (primitive=single element, composite=grouped elements, section=page region), note its purpose."

### Wireframe Output Generation

After image analysis, generate (per the `SYNC:ui-wireframe-protocol` block below):

1. **ASCII Wireframe** — Recreate layout using box-drawing characters
2. **Component Inventory** — List with tier classification (Common/Domain-Shared/Page)
3. **States Table** — Default, Loading, Empty, Error per view
4. **Component Decomposition Tree** — If detail level warrants (refine/story)
5. **Responsive Suggestions** — Based on layout complexity

Apply the **M1-M5/M7 Compliance for UI Specs** gate (below) to all wireframe-derived prose: business-level component names, no code-prop refs, map to feature logic by logical ID, observable state transitions, rebuild-from-spec, business-visible subject matter.

Wireframe-derived specs carry the same **Design-Principles Obligations** (below): the States Table (item 3) is authored empty/loading/error FIRST (`UI-1.5`) and covers all 5 interaction states per interactive element (`UI-5.2`); the Responsive Suggestions (item 5) break where the CONTENT breaks, not at device names (`UI-4.4`); and where the sketch is silent on type scale, spacing unit, or contrast (`UI-2.5`, `UI-4.1`, `UI-3.1`), record them in §4 as `[UNVERIFIED — needs design-system mapping]` rather than inventing one-off values measured off the drawing.

### Mapped Business Operations

Emit this table linking each interactive component to the feature operations/rules it drives (logical ID is the primary spine; mark `[UNVERIFIED — needs feature-spec mapping]` when the wireframe alone cannot determine it):

| Interactive Component | Interaction (observable) | Feature Operation / Rule (logical ID) | Notes                            |
| --------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Primary Button        | Click → submit form      | OP-XX                                 | Triggers create/update operation |
| Filter Dropdown       | Select → reload list     | OP-XX                                 | Drives query/search operation    |
| Row Action Menu       | Click → confirm dialog   | BR-XX                                 | Guarded by authorization rule    |

### Wireframe Output Formats

- **Format A: PBI Section (default)** — output a standalone `## UI Layout` section compatible with PBI/story templates (consumed by `$pbi-mockup`).
- **Format B: Standalone Spec** — output to `team-artifacts/design-specs/{YYMMDD}-wireframe-spec-{slug}.md`.

### Confidence & Review (wireframe)

- **Always display confidence level** for wireframe interpretation (analysis is 70-80% accurate).
- **Always recommend human review** before proceeding to implementation.
- If confidence <70%: ask clarifying questions about ambiguous elements by asking the user directly.

## Design-Principles Obligations (per spec section)

The spec is where the 40 UI/UX Design Principles (`UI-1.1`–`UI-9.4`, the `SYNC:ui-ux-design-principles` block below) become INHERITABLE — a downstream implementer builds what the spec SAYS, so an unstated clause is an unbuilt clause. Every spec this skill emits MUST carry these obligations in the named Output Format sections. Project design-system docs OUTRANK the clauses; a genuine conflict is surfaced to the user with both sides, NEVER resolved silently.

| Spec section | Clause obligation the section MUST carry |
| --- | --- |
| **§0 Design Plan** | The identity layer the 40 clauses do not cover (`SYNC:design-distinctiveness-gate`): name the subject/audience/job (`DD-1`), give all four plan parts a WHY traced to that subject (`DD-2`), and record the **Generic test** result — what you revised, or which axes the brief/design system already pinned (`DD-3`). A downstream implementer who receives no design plan supplies their own defaults, so an unstated direction is a templated build. |
| **§1 Overview** | Name the ONE focal point of the screen (`UI-1.1`), and name the surface(s) in scope (web / mobile / both) so the mobile clauses (`UI-8.1`–`UI-8.4`) are either binding or explicitly skipped. |
| **§3 Layout** | Group by proximity and shared alignment edges, never by nested borders (`UI-1.3`, `UI-1.4`); justify each breakpoint by where the CONTENT stops working, not by a device name (`UI-4.4`). |
| **§4 Design Tokens** | **DECLARE the type scale as 6 named steps with no one-off sizes** (`UI-2.5`): body 16px web / 17px mobile and NEVER below 14px (`UI-2.2`), measure 45–75 characters (`UI-2.3`), leading 1.5 body / 1.1–1.2 display (`UI-2.4`), max 2 families × 3 weights (`UI-2.1`). **DECLARE ONE spacing unit** — 4px or 8px base with every gap a multiple (`UI-4.1`), space owned by the container via a gap property (`UI-4.2`), inner padding tighter than the gap to the next group (`UI-4.3`). A token table of ad-hoc values instead of a declared scale FAILS this gate. |
| **§4 Design Tokens (colour)** | State the contrast TARGET AND THE MEASURED VALUE for every token pair — 4.5:1 text, 3:1 UI edges (`UI-3.1`) — measured, never eyeballed. One accent with one job (`UI-3.2`); dark mode specified as lifted surfaces + softened white text, NOT an inversion (`UI-3.4`). |
| **§5 States & Interactions** | **Author the empty, loading and error state FIRST — before the populated state (`UI-1.5`).** Enumerate ALL 5 interaction states per interactive element — default, hover, focus, active, disabled — plus loading where it applies (`UI-5.2`, consistent with the 7-state Component States Checklist below). Response under 100ms even when the result takes longer (`UI-5.1`); motion 150–250ms ease-out honouring reduced-motion (`UI-5.4`); undo preferred over confirmation, confirm ONLY the irreversible (`UI-5.3`). Forms: labels always visible, placeholders are hints NEVER labels (`UI-7.2`); validate on blur with the fix-it message beside the field (`UI-7.3`); NEVER lose entered data across errors, navigation or refresh (`UI-7.5`). |
| **§6 Accessibility** | The focus ring stays VISIBLE — restyled if it clashes, NEVER removed (`UI-5.5`); colour is never the sole carrier of meaning (`UI-3.3`); on any mobile/touch surface hit targets ≥44×44pt and 8px apart (`UI-8.1`), primary actions in the bottom third (`UI-8.2`), gestures never the only route (`UI-8.3`), safe areas and the on-screen keyboard respected (`UI-8.4`). |
| **§7 Open Questions** | Every clause deliberately deviated from, with the project doc or user decision that authorises it — an undocumented deviation is a spec defect, not a style choice. |

Keep every clause obligation written in observable UX language so it survives the M1-M5/M7 gate below — state the visible outcome, never a CSS property or framework prop.

**Skip ONLY** when the feature has no user-facing surface — state that explicitly so the skip is auditable, not an omission.

## M1-M5/M7 Compliance for UI Specs

See `.claude/skills/shared/sdd-artifact-contract.md` → "AI-SDD Mandates (M1-M7)" for BLOCKING criteria. A UI spec MUST satisfy these before handoff:

- **M1 — Business-level component names.** Name every component by its UX role — Primary Button, Secondary Button, Modal Dialog, Data Table, Dropdown, Toast — NEVER by a framework component class name or library import. FAIL on tech-term prose.
- **M2 — No code-prop refs in prose.** Describe behavior and appearance in plain UX language. NEVER reference component-state props, CSS class names, framework directives, or selectors in prose. Those belong only in `**Evidence**`/`[Source:]` carriers, frontmatter, and Mermaid.
- **M3 — Cross-reference by logical ID.** For every behavior driven by feature logic, cite the driving operation or rule by its logical ID (`OP-`/`BR-`/`FR-`) — link UI behavior back to the feature spec, not to handler code. Keep any `[Source: namespace/service/id]` abstract anchor strictly in the Evidence carrier — never physical code coordinates or repository-root paths.
- **M4 — Testable, unambiguous behavior.** Every state and interaction MUST have exactly one valid interpretation and an observable completion marker. Replace vague phrases ("handle appropriately", "show feedback") with the concrete observable result.
- **M5 — Rebuild-from-spec.** A reader with zero codebase knowledge MUST be able to rebuild this UI on ANY framework from the spec alone. If a marker is only resolvable by reading source, it fails M5 — restate it as a visual/textual observable.
- **M7 — Business-visibility.** A UI spec is a business-tree artifact, so apply the demo test to each case's BODY: *"what would a stakeholder SEE change?"* — no answer → FAIL as TECHNICAL-ONLY. Every `Given` = a state a user could arrange; every `When` = an action a user could take; every `Then` = an outcome a user could see. FAIL a `When` that is an invocation (a handler runs, a consumer receives, a job fires, data syncs) or a `Then` asserting schema/type/nullability/call-count. Judge the BODY, never the title or ID. ⚠️ **A UI state a user can SEE is business and PASSES M7** — a spinner, an empty placeholder, an error border, a disabled control are all demoable outcomes, not technical cases. Only invocation-shaped or schema-asserting cases fail.

> **M1 vs M7 — they are not the same gate.** M1 governs **vocabulary**; M7 governs **subject matter**. A technical case in impeccably tech-free prose satisfies M1 while violating M7 — *"the view correctly reflects the synchronized record"* names no framework, passes M1, and is still a technical case wearing a business costume. That gap is the most common way business specs rot. Ask what a user could SEE, not which words were used.

### Observable State Definitions

Define every state by what a user can SEE (color, icon, position, text), the business meaning, and the operation/rule that triggers it — NEVER by CSS class or component-state prop:

| State    | Visual Markers (observable)                              | Business Meaning                          | Triggering Operation / Rule (logical ID) |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Default  | Primary fill color, enabled label, no spinner            | Action available to the actor             | OP-XX (entry state)                      |
| Loading  | Spinner icon replaces label, control non-interactive     | Operation in progress, awaiting result    | OP-XX (request submitted)                |
| Disabled | Muted/gray fill, label dimmed, no pointer affordance      | Precondition not met / actor not permitted | BR-XX (authorization or guard rule)      |
| Error    | Error-color border, inline message text, alert icon       | Operation rejected or validation failed   | BR-XX (validation rule)                  |
| Empty    | Placeholder illustration + guidance text, no data rows    | No records exist for the current view     | OP-XX (query returned zero results)      |
| Success  | Confirmation toast/checkmark, updated visible data        | Operation completed and persisted         | OP-XX (operation succeeded)              |

## Component States Checklist

Every interactive component MUST document all 7 states by their **observable appearance and business meaning** — never by CSS class or framework prop (see M2):

- **Default** — resting appearance; action available to the actor
- **Hover** — pointer-over affordance change (cursor / elevation / color shift)
- **Active** — pressed/engaged feedback during interaction
- **Focus** — keyboard-focus indicator (visible ring/outline) for a11y traversal
- **Disabled** — muted/non-interactive; precondition or permission not met
- **Error** — validation/operation failure with inline message + alert affordance
- **Loading** — in-progress indicator (spinner / skeleton); control non-interactive

## Workflow Recommendation

> **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION — NO EXCEPTIONS:** If you are NOT already in a workflow, you MUST ATTENTION use ask the user directly to ask the user. Do NOT judge task complexity or decide this is "simple enough to skip" — the user decides whether to use a workflow, not you:
>
> 1. **Run the design sequence** (Recommended) — `$design-spec` → `$design --lane=product` (product UIs) or `$design --lane=marketing` (marketing/creative) → `$workflow-review-changes`
> 2. **Execute `$design-spec` directly** — run this skill standalone

---

> **[IMPORTANT]** Use task tracking to break ALL work into small tasks BEFORE starting — including tasks for each file read. This prevents context loss from long files. For simple tasks, AI MUST ATTENTION ask user whether to skip.

<!-- SYNC:existing-ui-research -->

> **[BLOCKING] Understand the existing UI before you design or spec a new/updated screen.** Before producing any wireframe, mockup, screen design, or UI spec:
>
> 1. **Inventory existing related UI** — search the project for screens, pages, and components already serving this feature or its domain (consult design-system docs + the real component inventory).
> 2. **Map connected flows** — identify every feature that links to, embeds, includes, or navigates to/from the new screen; trace its entry and exit flows so the new screen fits them.
> 3. **Reuse before invent** — prefer existing components, patterns, and layout conventions; justify any new component against what already exists.
> 4. **Record findings** — note the matched existing screens/components + connected flows in the artifact so downstream design faithfully matches the current UI system.
>
> **Skip ONLY** when the feature is backend-only (no UI) — state that explicitly.

<!-- /SYNC:existing-ui-research -->

<!-- SYNC:ui-intent-layer -->

> **[BLOCKING] Capture a tech-agnostic UI/UX intent layer in every UI-bearing spec — a reader must be able to visualize how the feature works without naming any technology.** When the feature has a user interface, the spec MUST ATTENTION carry an interaction-surface section so the application — not just its API — can be rebuilt on any stack:
>
> 1. **View Inventory** — list each view/screen by its UX ROLE and purpose (e.g. "list of items", "item editor", "confirmation step") and what information it presents. Describe by role, never by an implementation name.
> 2. **Navigation Map** — how a user moves between views: entry points, transitions, and exits. Trace how this surface connects to neighboring features already in the system.
> 3. **Key observable UI States** — the distinct states a user can observe per view (empty, loading, populated, error, success, permission-denied, etc.) — described as what the user perceives, not how it is rendered.
> 4. **Per-story interaction flow** — for each user story, the step-by-step click/action path from intent to outcome, cross-referenced to the logical IDs the spec already owns (`US-`/`OP-`/`BR-`).
> 5. **Couple to the companion design artifact** — keep deep visual fidelity (layout, tokens, pixel detail) OUT of the spec; it lives in the linked `design-spec`/mockup. Record that companion's path in the spec frontmatter so the spec stays the navigable hub.
>
> **M1-clean (NON-NEGOTIABLE):** the prose names ZERO frameworks, routes/URLs, CSS, or component-class names — only roles, information, states, and flows. Technology detail belongs in the companion design artifact, never here.
>
> **Skip ONLY** when the feature is backend-only (no UI) — state that reason explicitly in the section.

<!-- SYNC:ai-mistake-prevention -->

> **AI Mistake Prevention** — Failure modes to avoid on every task:
>
> **Re-read files after context changes.** Context compaction, resume, or long-running work can make memory stale; verify current files before acting.
> **Verify generated content against source evidence.** AI hallucinates APIs, names, claims, and document facts. Check the relevant source before documenting or referencing.
> **Check downstream references before deleting or renaming.** Removing an artifact can stale docs, generated mirrors, configs, and callers; map references first.
> **Trace the full impact chain after edits.** Changing a definition can miss derived outputs and consumers. Follow the affected chain before declaring done.
> **Verify ALL affected outputs, not just the first.** One green check is not all green checks; validate every output surface the change can affect.
> **Assume existing values are intentional — ask WHY before changing OR flagging one as a defect.** Before changing or reporting a constant, limit, flag, cutoff, wording, or pattern, read nearby context and history, the CALLER's ordering, and 2+ sibling call sites of the same convention. A doc stating WHAT without WHY is missing rationale, not proof of a missing guard.
> **Surface ambiguity before acting — don't pick silently.** Multiple valid interpretations require an explicit question or stated assumption with risk.
> **Assert the outcome your system owns, not the intermediate state your infrastructure owns.** When verifying async work, assert the final business state — never the delivery/retry bookkeeping held in shared infrastructure that any co-running process can write. Such a check passes when run alone and flakes the moment anything else shares that infrastructure.
> **Keep shared guidance role-relevant.** Universal guidance must help every receiving skill or agent; code-specific obligations belong only in code-specific protocols.

> **UI System Context** — For ANY task touching `.ts`, `.html`, `.scss`, or `.css` files:
>
> **MUST ATTENTION READ before implementing:**
>
> 1. `docs/project-reference/frontend-patterns-reference.md` — component base classes, stores, forms
> 2. `docs/project-reference/scss-styling-guide.md` — BEM methodology, SCSS variables, mixins, responsive
> 3. `docs/project-reference/design-system/README.md` — design tokens, component inventory, icons

> **UI/UX Design Principles (Rev 1.0 — 40 clauses, web + mobile)** — the working rule set for ANY task that designs, plans, implements, or reviews a user interface. Applies to BOTH platforms unless a clause names one (§8 is mobile/touch). Cite clauses by ID: `UI-3.1`, `UI-8.2`.
>
> **Precedence:** project design-system / SCSS / frontend-pattern docs OUTRANK these clauses; these clauses outrank generic taste. A genuine conflict is SURFACED to the user with both sides — NEVER resolved silently. — why: the project's own recorded decision is the authority; these clauses are the default when it is silent.
>
> **1.0 Visual Hierarchy & Layout**
>
> - `UI-1.1` One focal point per screen. Two elements competing for first read → demote one.
> - `UI-1.2` Signal order: size → weight → colour → position. Use the cheapest signal that works before adding another.
> - `UI-1.3` Group by proximity, NEVER by border. Whitespace separates cleanly; boxes inside boxes do not.
> - `UI-1.4` Align to a shared edge. Every unexplained indent reads as an accident.
> - `UI-1.5` Design the empty, loading and error state FIRST. The full state is the easy one.
>
> **2.0 Typography**
>
> - `UI-2.1` Max 2 families, 3 weights each. More variety reads as inconsistency, not range.
> - `UI-2.2` Body text 16px web, 17px mobile. NEVER below 14px for anything a user must read.
> - `UI-2.3` Line length 45–75 characters. Constrain the measure, not the container.
> - `UI-2.4` Leading scales inversely with size: 1.5 body, 1.1–1.2 display.
> - `UI-2.5` Fixed type scale — 6 named steps shared with engineering. NEVER one-off sizes.
>
> **3.0 Colour & Contrast**
>
> - `UI-3.1` Contrast 4.5:1 text, 3:1 UI edges. Measure it — NEVER judge by eye on a bright screen.
> - `UI-3.2` One accent, one job. An accent that is everywhere points at nothing.
> - `UI-3.3` Colour NEVER carries meaning alone — pair it with an icon, label or position.
> - `UI-3.4` Dark mode is NOT inverted light mode. Lift surfaces to signal elevation; soften pure-white text.
>
> **4.0 Spacing & Grid**
>
> - `UI-4.1` One spacing unit, multiplied — 4px or 8px base; every gap a multiple of it.
> - `UI-4.2` Space belongs to the container, not the child. Use `gap`; reserve margins for exceptions.
> - `UI-4.3` Tighter inside, looser between — inner padding always smaller than the gap to the next group.
> - `UI-4.4` Breakpoints follow content, not devices. Break where the layout stops working.
>
> **5.0 Interaction & Feedback**
>
> - `UI-5.1` Every action gets a response under 100ms, even when the result takes longer.
> - `UI-5.2` Specify all 5 states — default, hover, focus, active, disabled — plus loading where it applies.
> - `UI-5.3` Prefer undo over confirmation. Confirm ONLY what cannot be reversed.
> - `UI-5.4` Motion clarifies cause and effect: 150–250ms, ease-out, honours reduced-motion.
> - `UI-5.5` Keep the visible focus ring. Restyle it if it clashes; NEVER remove it.
>
> **6.0 Navigation & IA**
>
> - `UI-6.1` Every screen answers: where am I, what's here, where next.
> - `UI-6.2` Max 5 top-level destinations. Depth beats a crowded first level.
> - `UI-6.3` Label by the user's word, not the internal one. Team vocabulary is not a taxonomy.
> - `UI-6.4` Every state deserves a URL or a back path. Deep links and hardware back must land somewhere sensible.
>
> **7.0 Forms & Input**
>
> - `UI-7.1` Ask for less. Every field needs a reason it exists today.
> - `UI-7.2` Labels stay visible. Placeholders are hints, NEVER labels.
> - `UI-7.3` Validate on blur, not on keystroke. Errors sit next to the field and say how to fix it.
> - `UI-7.4` Match keyboard to data type — correct input type, autocomplete and autocapitalise on every field.
> - `UI-7.5` NEVER lose entered data. Preserve input across errors, navigation and refresh.
>
> **8.0 Mobile & Touch** _(mobile/touch surfaces)_
>
> - `UI-8.1` Hit target ≥44×44pt, 8px apart. The target may exceed the visible icon.
> - `UI-8.2` Primary actions in the bottom third — that is where the thumb lives.
> - `UI-8.3` Gestures are shortcuts, NEVER the only route. Anything swipeable is also tappable.
> - `UI-8.4` Respect safe areas and the keyboard. Notch, home indicator and on-screen keyboard all steal space.
>
> **9.0 Speed & Perceived Speed**
>
> - `UI-9.1` Show structure before data — skeletons for known layouts, spinners only for unknown waits.
> - `UI-9.2` Assume success optimistically. Update UI first, reconcile after, roll back visibly on failure.
> - `UI-9.3` Reserve space for anything that loads. Images, ads and fonts must NEVER shift the layout.
> - `UI-9.4` Design for the slow connection. Offline, timeout and retry are states, NOT edge cases.
>
> **Apply by role** — the clauses are one set; what you DO with them depends on the task:
>
> | Role                                | Obligation                                                                                                                                                              |
> | ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
> | DESIGN / PLAN a surface             | Clauses shape the artifact: empty/loading/error specified first (`UI-1.5`), all 5 states enumerated (`UI-5.2`), type scale + spacing unit declared (`UI-2.5`, `UI-4.1`) |
> | IMPLEMENT a component               | Pre-completion gate: states · tokens · contrast · focus ring · touch target · reserved space (`UI-5.2`, `UI-2.5`/`UI-4.1`, `UI-3.1`, `UI-5.5`, `UI-8.1`, `UI-9.3`)      |

<!-- SYNC:design-distinctiveness-gate -->

> **[BLOCKING] Design distinctiveness gate (`DD-1`–`DD-8`) — binds on ANY task that designs, plans, mocks up, implements, or reviews a user-facing visual surface.** Deep catalog: `.claude/docs/design-knowledge.md`. Cite findings as `DD-<clause>` + `file:line`.
>
> **Precedence (resolve in this order, never silently):** the **brief's own stated visual direction WINS outright** — including when it asks for one of the `DD-4` tells. Then the **project's design-system / SCSS / frontend-pattern docs and accepted ADRs** — a house style IS an intentional identity, and re-deciding it per feature is the incoherence this gate prevents. Then these clauses. A genuine conflict is SURFACED to the user with both sides, NEVER resolved silently.
>
> **Relationship to `UI-1.1`–`UI-9.4`:** a different question, no overlap — the 40 clauses ask _"is this usable, accessible, consistent?"_ (a measurable floor); this gate asks _"is this THIS product's interface, or the one any generator would emit for any brief?"_. A surface can pass all 40 clauses and still be a template. BOTH bind; where they touch (type scale, colour, motion timing) the clause sets the floor and this gate picks the value.
>
> - `DD-1` **Ground it in the subject matter.** Before designing, name the concrete subject, the audience, and the design's primary job — and CONFIRM with the user when the brief is silent. Distinctive choices come FROM the subject's industry, materials and vernacular; they are never taste applied on top. **Test: if the palette, type and layout would fit a different product unchanged, there is no identity yet.**
> - `DD-2` **Every choice carries a WHY.** "It's common", "it's clean", "users expect it" are not reasons. A decision with no articulable reason is a default that arrived unnoticed. Defaults hide in what feels like infrastructure — typography, navigation, data display, and TOKEN NAMES. **Token-name test: someone reading only your CSS variables should be able to guess what product this is** (`--ink`/`--parchment` evoke a world; `--gray-700`/`--surface-2` evoke a template).
> - `DD-3` **Two passes, and the review pass is mandatory.** (1a) Write a compact **design plan** — Colour (4–6 named hex values) · Type (families + roles + scale) · Layout (one-sentence prose + ASCII wireframes to compare alternatives, including alignment: left/centre/justified) · Principles (what makes THIS page unique). (1b) **BLOCKING generic test — before any code:** work through a similar prompt and see whether you arrive somewhere similar; **any part that reads like the generic default for any comparable page rather than a choice for THIS brief gets REVISED, and you state what you changed and why.** Then (2a) build the REVISED plan, (2b) critique. — why: writing a plan and going straight to code reproduces the default, because the plan came from the same patterns the code will.
> - `DD-4` **Audit every FREE axis against the generated-design tell catalog** (`[model-knowledge]`, calibration not prohibition — each trait is legitimate for SOME brief): **T1** cream `#F4F1EA` + high-contrast serif + terracotta near `#D97757` (Anthropic's own interaction accent — on a user's brief it reads specifically as a tell) · **T2** near-black + one acid-green/vermilion accent · **T3** broadsheet hairline-rule pastiche, zero radius, dense columns · **T4** the SaaS-card kit: identical rounded cards, ONE radius regardless of hierarchy, the same `rgba(0,0,0,.1)` shadow under each, gradient washes as decoration · **T5** template chrome whatever the subject: tracked-out ALL-CAPS eyebrow above every heading, meta strings joined with middle dots (`A · B · C`), `WORD — fragment` labels with a spaced em dash, tinted near-black (`#0B0B0B`/`#111`) standing in for black, monospace for small data labels, `→` appended to link/button text. **A match is a HYPOTHESIS about a missed decision, never a defect** — promote it only by naming the axis, that the brief left it free, and what the subject suggested instead.
> - `DD-5` **Typography carries the personality.** One family, or two CLEARLY distinct ones — you do NOT need separate display and body faces. Choose deliberately, not the default you would reach for on any project. Set a real scale with intentional weights, widths and spacing. When type is a headline it is an ACTIVE part of the design, not a neutral delivery vehicle. Measure under ~80 characters; serifs tolerate slightly longer lines and want slightly more line-height than sans at the same size. Hierarchy needs weight/tracking/opacity, not size alone. **Avoid the three commonest tells: accenting a single word in a headline (italic/bold/colour) · ALL CAPS labels · an eyebrow label that names the section the heading already names.**
> - `DD-6` **Structure is information, not decoration.** Outlines, borders, numbering, eyebrows, dividers and labels must encode something about the content. **Before adding numbered markers (`01 / 02 / 03`), check the content really IS a sequence** — a stepped process, timeline or ranking. For every device ask: what does this tell the reader that whitespace would not? Nothing → cut it. **Hero:** open with the most characteristic thing in the subject's world, in whatever form fits (headline, image, animation, live demo, interactive moment) — big-number-plus-small-label-plus-gradient is the DEFAULT treatment, so use it only when it is genuinely best here. **Composition:** rhythm over monotone (same card size, same gap, same density everywhere is the sound of no one deciding); proportions must say something you can articulate; one dominant focal point.
> - `DD-7` **Motion sparingly and deliberately.** Non-user-triggered motion draws attention ONLY. One orchestrated moment — a single page-load sequence or one reveal — lands better than scattered effects; **fade-and-slide-up entrances on each section and hover transitions on every card are the generic default and read as generated.** Motion that ANSWERS a person's action (opening, expanding, confirming) is welcome when it shows what changed. Honour `prefers-reduced-motion`.
> - `DD-8` **Spend boldness once, then remove one accessory.** Let ONE element be the memorable thing and keep everything around it quiet and disciplined; cut any decoration that does not serve the brief. **Critique the BUILT page, not just the plan** — composition, craft (density is a decision, not a constant), content coherence, and CSS honesty (negative margins undoing a parent's padding, `calc()` values that exist only as workarounds, absolute positioning to escape layout flow are lies; the correct answer is always simpler than the hack). Take screenshots to review where the environment supports it — a picture is worth 1000 tokens. Then ask "if they said this lacks craft, what would they point to?" and fix that. **Build the quality floor in silently** — responsive, visible keyboard focus, reduced-motion respected, measured contrast, tokens never raw hex or magic numbers — and watch CSS selector specificity, where a type-based selector (`.section`) and an element-based one (`.cta`) most often cancel each other's padding/margin.
>
> **Memory:** vary between briefs — light and dark, families, direction. NEVER converge on the same choice across generations (Space Grotesk, for example). Where the project already has a design system, tokens, or an `interface-system.md`, ADOPT and record it rather than re-deciding; write back any pattern used 2+ times with measurements worth remembering.
>
> **Skip ONLY** when the change has NO user-facing visual surface (backend-only, tooling, docs) — state that reason explicitly so the skip is auditable, not an omission.

Deep detail: `.claude/docs/design-knowledge.md` §8. Copy makes a design feel as templated as the visuals do.
>
> Before writing anything, ask what the design needs to SAY and how it can best be said to help the person navigate the experience. Then:
>
> 1. **Write from the end user's perspective.** Name things by what users will understand in simple language, not by how the system is built — a user manages **notifications**, not **webhook config**. Describe what something is or does in plain terms rather than selling it. Being specific and legible to a new user ALWAYS beats being clever.
> 2. **Active voice by default.** A CTA says exactly what happens when it is used: **"Save changes"**, NEVER "Submit".
> 3. **One name per action, across the whole flow.** The button that says **Publish** produces a toast that says **Published**. The vocabulary of an interface is the signposting for someone navigating the product — cohesion and consistency are how people learn their way around.
> 4. **Failure and emptiness give DIRECTION, not mood.** Explain what went wrong and how to fix it, in the interface's voice rather than a person's. **Errors do NOT apologize, and are NEVER vague about what happened.** An empty screen is an invitation to act.
> 5. **Conversational tone, one job per element.** Plain verbs, sentence case, no filler, tone matched to the brand and the audience; let each written element do exactly one job.
> 6. **Real content, never lorem.** When the brief supplies no copy, write plausible strings for the ACTUAL subject. **Coherence check — read every visible string as a user would, checking for truth, not typos:** could a real person at a real company be looking at exactly this data right now, or does the page title belong to one product, the body to another, and the sidebar metrics to a third? A beautifully designed interface with nonsensical content is a movie set with no script.
>
> **Skip ONLY** when the change surfaces no user-visible text — state that explicitly.

<!-- /SYNC:ui-copywriting -->

<!-- SYNC:design-review-checklist -->

> **Front-End Design Review Checklist** — the EXECUTABLE review protocol for any artifact carrying a user-facing front-end surface. Full catalog (`A1`…`Q`, ~130 checks with failure signals and default severities): **`.claude/docs/design-review-checklist.md`**. This gate carries the protocol and the triage pass; the file carries the checks.
>
> **Applies when — and ONLY when — the change, plan, or artifact carries a user-facing front-end surface.** A back-end-only diff, a doc edit, or a config change is `N/A`: state that once and move on. NEVER run a UI review on a non-UI change to manufacture coverage. When it DOES apply, **MUST ATTENTION READ `.claude/docs/design-review-checklist.md` and work its sections** — a review that cites a check ID without opening the catalog is asserting, not checking.
>
> **`CL-1` Context before checks (§0.1).** Establish platform · primary user & expertise · primary task · success metric · constraints · review scope · available artifacts. Fewer than four known → state the gap at the top of the report and mark affected findings **low confidence** — why: a check judged against an unknown task is a guess wearing an ID.
>
> **`CL-2` Evidence or nothing (§0.2).** Every finding cites a specific location (screen · element · `file:line`). NEVER invent a measurement — contrast, tap-target size, and load time that cannot be measured from the given artifact are `NOT VERIFIABLE`, never a guessed number. Tag every finding `MEASURED` · `OBSERVED` · `HEURISTIC`. Status values: `PASS` · `FAIL` · `PARTIAL` · `N/A` · `NOT VERIFIABLE`.
>
> **`CL-3` Severity, then a cap (§0.3).** `P0` blocks task completion / loses data / excludes a protected group (ship blocker) · `P1` significant friction or a legal accessibility floor (fix before release) · `P2` measurable inefficiency (next iteration) · `P3` polish (backlog) · `P4` note. Cap the report at the top 10 by severity unless a full audit was requested. A clean section reports "no issues found" — NEVER pad. Every `P0`/`P1` carries a concrete fix.
>
> **`CL-4` Section sweep, in order.** §A core usability heuristics · §B cognitive load & decision design · §C visual design & hierarchy · §D interaction + **the eight screen states** (ideal, empty, first-run, loading, partial, error, offline, maximum-data) · §E information architecture · **§F web / §G mobile / §H desktop — conditional on platform** · §I accessibility (WCAG 2.2 AA; every item `P1` minimum, `P0` when it blocks the task) · §J content & UX writing · §K trust, ethics & privacy (dark patterns are `P0`) · **§L AI & agentic patterns — conditional on the product having AI features** · §M cross-cutting consistency · §N edge-case probes. One focused pass per section — why: a section skipped in the long middle silently becomes an unreported defect class.
>
> **`CL-5` Quick Triage Pass (§P)** when a full sweep is not possible — these 10 catch the majority of serious defects: (1) can a new user complete the primary task unaided · (2) does every action give visible feedback within 400ms · (3) do empty/loading/error states exist AND offer a forward path · (4) is the primary action obvious, singular, reachable · (5) text ≥4.5:1 contrast and focus visible · (6) whole flow completable by keyboard · (7) touch targets ≥44/48px · (8) destructive actions reversible · (9) holds at 320px and 200% zoom · (10) any dark patterns.
>
> **`CL-6` Report shape (§O).** Context (+ known gaps) → Verdict (Ship / Ship with fixes / Do not ship) → What works (2–4 specific strengths, cited) → Findings grouped `P0`→`P3`, each with Location · Evidence + tag · Impact · Principle (checklist ID) · Fix → Open questions → Coverage table. Any `P0` caps the grade at Fail regardless of score; report a score only ALONGSIDE findings, never instead of them.
>
> **Precedence and no-double-counting.** The project's design-system / SCSS / frontend-pattern docs and accepted ADRs OUTRANK this checklist; the brief's stated direction outranks aesthetic judgment. A deliberate, documented convention is NEVER a defect — check intent before flagging, and surface a genuine conflict to the user with both sides, NEVER resolve it silently. This checklist is the review PROCEDURE, not a third set of taste rules: `UI-1.1`–`UI-9.4` ask "does it meet the usability floor?", `DD-1`–`DD-8` ask "is this THIS product's interface?", and these checks ask "did the review actually look, with evidence, and rank it?". Where a check restates a `UI-*` or `DD-*` clause, report the defect ONCE under whichever ID the consuming skill already uses.
>
> **For a PLAN or a PLAN REVIEW.** When the plan contains front-end work, the checklist binds the plan's ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA, not a built page: name the platform, the applicable conditional sections (§F/§G/§H, §L), the eight screen states each UI phase must deliver (§D2), and the §I accessibility floor — so the work is specified against the checklist before it is written. A UI phase whose acceptance criteria omit the states and the a11y floor is INCOMPLETE — say so.

A matched body that is missing or malformed is REPORTED and skipped — never reconstructed from the index Description. No index, or no match -> proceed with no overlay, silently.

> Overlays are **ADDITIVE ONLY**: they ADD rules on top of this skill's own protocol and NEVER replace, override, disable, or reinterpret a rule it already states — removing every overlay must return this skill to exactly its documented behavior. An overlay is a BRIEF, not an authority escalation: it can NEVER waive a workflow gate, git discipline, a review gate, or a user-confirmation gate.

<!-- SYNC:design-distinctiveness-gate:reminder -->

- **MUST ATTENTION** apply the design distinctiveness gate (`DD-1`–`DD-8`) to any user-facing visual surface: ground it in the named subject/audience/job and confirm when the brief is silent (`DD-1`) · every choice carries a WHY, token names included (`DD-2`) · write a design plan (colour 4–6 named hex · type families+roles+scale · layout prose+ASCII+alignment · principles) then run the BLOCKING generic test and state what you revised BEFORE coding (`DD-3`) · audit every free axis against the T1–T5 tell catalog — cream+serif+`#D97757`, acid-on-black, broadsheet, the SaaS-card kit, template chrome (ALL-CAPS eyebrows, `A · B · C`, spaced-em-dash labels, `#0B0B0B`, mono data labels, trailing `→`) — a match is a missed decision, never a defect (`DD-4`) · 1–2 clearly distinct families, real scale, <80ch, no single-word headline accent / ALL-CAPS labels / redundant eyebrows (`DD-5`) · numbering only on real sequences; hero = the subject's most characteristic thing, not big-number+gradient (`DD-6`) · one orchestrated motion moment, never per-section entrances plus universal card hovers (`DD-7`) · spend boldness once, critique the BUILT page, remove one accessory (`DD-8`). The brief's stated direction OUTRANKS the tell catalog; project design-system docs OUTRANK these clauses — genuine conflicts go to the user, NEVER resolved silently.

Project design-system docs and ADRs OUTRANK the checklist; report a defect ONCE across `UI-*`/`DD-*`/`CL-*`.

## Closing Reminders

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION Goal:** Produce a structured, tech-agnostic UI/UX design specification that preserves the PBI's complete releasable UI outcome — every required page/view, navigation path, component, state, responsive rule, accessibility need, and end-to-end demo journey — so a developer can rebuild it on ANY stack.

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION main steps (do not forget any):**

- **Step 0–0b first** — inventory existing related UI + map connected flows (record in §1); seed from the governing Feature Spec's §6 and reuse its view/state vocabulary verbatim — why: reinventing what exists or renaming spec terms breaks the navigable hub.
- **Step 1–2** — route by input type (Figma→`$figma-design`, image→visual analysis, wireframe→`--mode=wireframe`, PBI/text→extract), then set Quick (§1–4) vs Full (§1–7) complexity.
- **Step 3–6** — author component inventory (new vs existing), all 7 states + interactions, design tokens (reuse design-system), responsive breakpoints.
- **Releasable full-flow surface** — never collapse a multi-page PBI/mockup into one screen; carry the complete page/view, navigation, common/domain/page component, state, and flow inventories forward and deepen them.
- **Step 7–8** — save to `team-artifacts/design-specs/`, then set the governing Feature Spec's `design_spec:`/`mockup:` frontmatter to the saved path (frontmatter only) — why: the link-back gate fails without it.
- **M1–M5 gate (BLOCKING)** — business-level component names, no code-prop refs in prose, cross-ref behavior by logical ID (`OP-`/`BR-`/`FR-`), one testable interpretation per state, rebuildable from spec alone — why: a tech-leaking spec cannot be rebuilt on another stack.

**Protocols in force (concise digest of the SYNC/shared blocks this skill carries):**

- **AI Mistake Prevention:** verify generated content against evidence, trace downstream references, verify all affected outputs, re-read after context loss, surface ambiguity.
- **UI System Context:** read frontend-patterns, scss-styling, design-system before any UI change.
- **UI Wireframe:** ASCII wireframe, tiered component inventory, states table, tokens, responsive breakpoints.
- **Critical Thinking:** traced `file:line` proof per claim, confidence >80% to act.

- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** break work into small todo tasks using task tracking BEFORE starting
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** search codebase for 3+ similar patterns before creating new code
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** cite `file:line` evidence for every claim (confidence >80% to act)
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** add a final review todo task to verify work quality
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** carry the 40 UI/UX Design Principles (`UI-1.1`–`UI-9.4`) into the spec sections so implementers INHERIT them: §5 authors empty/loading/error FIRST (`UI-1.5`) and enumerates all 5 interaction states per interactive element (`UI-5.2`); §4 DECLARES the 6-step type scale (`UI-2.5`) and the ONE 4/8px spacing unit (`UI-4.1`) instead of one-off values, with contrast targets measured and stated (4.5:1 text / 3:1 edges, `UI-3.1`); §6 keeps the focus ring visible (`UI-5.5`), colour never alone (`UI-3.3`), and ≥44×44pt targets + bottom-third primaries on touch surfaces (`UI-8.1`, `UI-8.2`); §7 records every deliberate deviation — why: an unstated clause is an unbuilt clause once the spec leaves this skill

**Anti-Rationalization:**

| Evasion                                          | Rebuttal                                                                                              |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "I'll skip the existing-UI inventory and design" | Step 0 is BLOCKING — inventory existing screens/flows first or the spec contradicts the live UI.     |
| "Naming the framework component is clearer"       | M1/M2 FAIL — name by UX role; framework/CSS names live only in Evidence/frontmatter/Mermaid.         |
| "The spec already names views — I'll re-partition"| Reuse §6 view + state vocabulary verbatim; renaming breaks the navigable spec↔design hub.            |
| "Saved the file — done"                           | Step 8 link-back is required; set the spec's `design_spec:` frontmatter or `artifact-review` fails.   |
| "'Show feedback' describes the error state"       | M4 FAIL — every state needs one observable completion marker, not a vague phrase.                     |

**[TASK-PLANNING]** Before acting, analyze task scope and systematically break it into small todo tasks and sub-tasks using task tracking.

> **[IMPORTANT]** Analyze how big the task is and break it into many small todo tasks systematically before starting — this is very important.

Source: `.claude/.ck.json` + `.claude/skills/shared/sync-inline-versions.md` (`:full` blocks) + `.claude/scripts/lib/hookless-prompt-protocol.cjs`

## [WORKFLOW-EXECUTION-PROTOCOL] [BLOCKING] Workflow Execution Protocol — MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST CRITICAL. Do not skip for any reason.

**Generic portability boundary:** Reusable skills and protocol text stay project-neutral; project-specific conventions are discovered from docs/project-config.json and docs/project-reference/. Apply shared AI-SDD from `shared/sdd-artifact-contract.md`. Read `docs/project-config.json` and `docs/project-reference/docs-index-reference.md`, then open the project reference docs named there. For spec, test-case, behavior-change, public-contract, or `docs/specs/` work, route through the local spec docs named by the docs index: `feature-spec-reference.md`, `spec-system-reference.md`, `spec-principles.md`, and `workflow-spec-test-code-cycle-reference.md` when specs/tests/code must stay synchronized. If either file or a required reference doc is missing or stale, auto-run `$project-init` (or the narrow lower-level route such as `$project-config`, `$docs-init`, `$scan-all`, or `$scan --target=<key>`) before ordinary project-specific work. Any supported AI tool may execute when this shared context and local docs are available.

1. **DETECT:** If the prompt starts with an explicit slash skill/workflow command, execute it directly. Otherwise match the prompt against the workflow catalog and skill list.
2. **ANALYZE:** Choose the best option: execute directly, invoke a skill, activate a standard workflow, or compose a custom step combination.
3. **AUTO-SELECT:** Pick the best option yourself. Do not ask the user to choose between direct execution, skill, standard workflow, or custom workflow.
4. **ACTIVATE:** For a selected workflow, call `$start-workflow <workflowId>`; for a selected skill, invoke that skill; for a custom workflow, sequence custom steps directly; for direct execution, proceed with the task.
5. **CREATE TASKS:** task tracking for ALL workflow/skill/custom steps before execution when the selected path has multiple steps.
6. **PARALLELIZE:** Before executing the task list, tag each task `PAR` (independent inputs + write set disjoint from every other `PAR` task) or `SEQ` (name the blocking dependency), group `PAR` tasks into waves, declare the wave plan, and spawn each wave's sub-agents in ONE message — all-return barrier per wave, fan-out one level deep unless a sub-agent's own definition authorizes further fan-out. Sequential-by-default is a defect when tasks are independent; do not parallelize shared write targets, output-consuming tasks, trivial single-file work, ordering a skill or workflow explicitly fixes, or user-approval gates.
7. **EXECUTE:** Advance per the **Workflow Step Advancement & Parallel Phases** rule in your context instructions — model-driven; a sub-agent completion advances a step identically to an inline call; a parallel-phase group is an all-return barrier (advance only after ALL members return, never serialize it)

## SYNC:ai-sdd-artifact-contract:reminder

- **MANDATORY** Apply `shared/sdd-artifact-contract.md`; keep reusable AI-SDD in `.claude` and local rules in project docs.
- **MANDATORY** Code-to-spec extraction is reference-only until canonical acceptance; any supported AI tool may execute with synced context.
- **MANDATORY** Update `.claude` source before syncing generated mirrors; do not manually edit `.agents`, `.codex`, or `AGENTS.md`.
- **MANDATORY** Missing or stale project config, root instruction files, or required reference docs route project-specific work through `$project-init` or the narrow setup route automatically.
**[TASK-PLANNING] [MANDATORY]** BEFORE executing any workflow or skill step, create/update task tracking for all planned steps, then keep it synchronized as each step starts/completes.
## [LESSON-LEARNED-REMINDER] [BLOCKING] Task Planning & Continuous Improvement — MANDATORY. Do not skip.

Break work into small tasks (task tracking) before starting. Add final task: "Analyze AI mistakes & lessons learned".

**Extract lessons — ROOT CAUSE ONLY, not symptom fixes:**
1. Name the FAILURE MODE (reasoning/assumption failure), not symptom — "assumed API existed without reading source" not "used wrong enum value".
2. Generality test: does this failure mode apply to ≥3 contexts/codebases? If not, abstract one level up.
3. Write as a universal rule — strip project-specific names/paths/classes. Useful on any codebase.
4. Consolidate: multiple mistakes sharing one failure mode → ONE lesson.
5. **Recurrence gate:** "Would this recur in future session WITHOUT this reminder?" — No → skip `$learn`.
6. **Auto-fix gate:** "Could `$code-review`/`$code-simplifier`/`$security-review`/`$lint` catch this?" — Yes → improve review skill instead.
7. BOTH gates pass → ask user to run `$learn`.
**[CRITICAL-THINKING-MINDSET]** Apply critical thinking, sequential thinking. Every claim needs traced proof, confidence >80% to act.
**Anti-hallucination principle:** Never present guess as fact — cite sources for every claim, admit uncertainty freely, self-check output for errors, cross-reference independently, stay skeptical of own confidence — certainty without evidence root of all hallucination.
**AI Attention principle (Primacy-Recency):** Put the 3 most critical rules at both top and bottom of long prompts/protocols so instruction adherence survives long context windows.
**Goal-driven execution:** Define success criteria first, loop until verified, and stop only when observable checks pass.
**Tests verify intent:** Tests must protect business rules/invariants and fail when the protected intent breaks, not only mirror current behavior.
## Common AI Mistake Prevention (System Lessons)

- **Re-read files after context compaction.** Edit requires prior Read in same context; compaction wipes read state. Re-read before editing.
- **Grep for old terms after bulk replacements.** AI over-trusts find/replace completeness. Grep full repo after bulk edits for missed refs in docs/configs/catalogs.
- **Check downstream references before deleting.** Deletions cascade doc/code staleness. Map referencing files before removal.
- **After memory loss, check existing state before creating new.** Compaction wipes prior-work memory. Query current state to resume — never blindly duplicate.
- **Verify AI-generated content against actual code.** AI hallucinates APIs, class names, method signatures. Grep to confirm existence before documenting/referencing.
- **Trace full dependency chain after edits.** Changing a definition misses downstream consumers. Trace the full chain.
- **When renaming, grep ALL consumer file types.** Some file types silently ignore missing refs (no compile error). Search code, templates, configs, generated files.
- **Trace ALL code paths when verifying correctness.** Code existing ≠ code executing. Trace early exits, error branches, conditional skips — not just happy path.
- **Update docs that embed canonical data when source changes.** Docs inlining derived data (workflows, schemas, configs) go stale silently. Update all embedding docs alongside source.
- **Verify sub-agent results after context recovery.** Background agents may finish while parent compacted — grep-verify output, don't trust assumed completion.
- **Cross-check full target list against sub-agent assignments.** Parallel sub-agents by category miss boundary items. Reconcile union of assignments against target list before proceeding.
- **Sub-agents inherit knowledge only from their agent .md definition — use custom agent types, not built-in Explore.** Tool adoption = permission + knowledge + enforcement (numbered workflow step).
- **Persist sub-agent findings incrementally, not as a final batch.** Long sub-agents hit cutoffs before final write — findings lost. Instruct append-per-section to report file.
- **When debugging, ask "whose responsibility?" before fixing.** Trace caller (wrong data) vs callee (wrong handling). Fix at responsible layer — never patch symptom site.
- **Test failure → record a provisional verdict before trace/edit, then investigate.** Use the full five-way taxonomy: SOURCE-WRONG (production violates intent), TEST-WRONG (assertion/setup is stale), TEST-NOT-OPTIMAL (valid but fragile or low-signal test), ENVIRONMENT-BLOCKED (external state prevents a verdict), or AMBIGUOUS (intent/evidence cannot choose safely). Then trace root cause and triangulate against the governing spec (`docs/specs/**` if one exists) AND source. NEVER weaken an assertion, add a skip, relax a timeout, or change source merely to force green.
- **Grep ALL removed names after extraction/refactoring.** Primary file "done" ≠ secondary files clean. Grep entire scope for every removed symbol before declaring complete.
- **Assume existing values are intentional — ask WHY before changing OR flagging one as a defect.** Pattern-matching as "wrong" skips context. Before changing or reporting any constant/limit/flag/cutoff: read comments, git blame, the CALLER's ordering (the guarantee that makes the value correct usually lives in code running immediately BEFORE the cited line), and 2+ sibling call sites of the same convention. A doc stating WHAT without WHY is missing rationale, not proof of a missing guard — and in a validation pass, an accurate `file:line` citation proves the transcription, never the defect.
- **Verify ALL affected outputs, not just the first.** One build green ≠ all green. Multi-stack changes (backend/frontend/tests/docs) require verifying EVERY output.
- **Evaluate fit before copying a nearby pattern.** Closest example ≠ matching preconditions — verify the new context shares the same constraints, base classes, scope, lifetime.
- **Holistic-first debugging — resist nearest-attention trap.** Don't dive into first plausible cause. List EVERY precondition (config, env vars, paths, DB, endpoints, creds, versions, DI, data). Verify each against evidence (grep/query — not reasoning). Ask "what would falsify this?" — if nothing, it's not a hypothesis. Most expensive failure: going deeper in "obvious" layer while bug sits in layer never questioned.
- **Surgical changes — apply the diff test (context-aware).** Two modes: (1) Bug fix → every line traces to the bug; no restyling; orphan cleanup only for imports YOUR changes made unused. (2) Review/enhancement → implement improvements AND announce as "Enhancement beyond main request: [what]". Never silently scope-creep. Diff test: "Would this line exist if I wasn't asked to do X?" — if no, delete or announce.
- **Surface ambiguity before coding — don't pick silently.** Multiple valid interpretations → present each with effort: "[Request] could mean (1) [N h], (2) [N h]. Which matters?" List scope/format/volume/constraints assumptions first. If simpler path exists, say so. Never silently pick.
- **[MANDATORY FIRST ACTION] ALWAYS activate a suitable skill or workflow BEFORE responding.** Match task against workflow catalog + skill list; invoke via skill invocation or `$start-workflow <workflowId>`. NEVER answer or write code before checking. Skip = protocol violation.
- **Why-Review adversarial mindset — apply when reviewing any plan, decision, or design.** Default SKEPTIC not VALIDATOR: steel-man a rejected alternative, invert each stated reason ("what does it sacrifice?"), stress-test top 2-3 assumptions, run pre-mortem ("ships, fails in 3 months — what breaks?"), surface 1-2 alternatives author missed. Section presence ≠ quality; quality = causal reasoning + concrete mitigations + evidence, not "it's better" or "monitor closely".
- **Front-load report-write in sub-agent prompts for large reviews.** Many-file sub-agents hit budget before final write — findings lost. Design prompts so: (1) report-write is first explicit deliverable, (2) append per-file/section (not batched), (3) scope bounded so reads don't exhaust budget. Truncated mid-sentence with no report file → spawn narrower scope, don't retry same prompt.
- **After context compaction, re-verify all prior phase outcomes before continuing.** Summaries describe intent, not environment state (git index, filesystem, processes). On resume, FIRST audit: git status, re-read modified files, verify filesystem. Every "completed" claim is an untested hypothesis until evidence confirms.
- **OOM/memory: check row count before row size.** Triage: (1) Unbounded query — no DB filter for trigger? Push filter to DB; eliminates OOM. (2) Large rows? Projection reduces proportionally. Row reduction > projection in ROI.
- **Assert the outcome your system OWNS, never the intermediate state your INFRASTRUCTURE owns.** When testing anything asynchronous (queue/broker delivery, retries, background jobs, caches, replication), assert the final business/entity state. NEVER assert the delivery bookkeeping — consume/send status, attempt counts, last-error, row existence or counts in a broker, scheduler, or outbox/inbox table. That bookkeeping lives in shared infrastructure that ANY co-running process (a peer worker, a second replica, a leftover local container) can write, usually under a deterministic shared key, so the assertion silently tests the developer's environment instead of the system: green when run alone, flaky the instant anything else shares that broker + database. Gate question for every assertion: "would this hold no matter WHICH process did the work?" — if no, assert the converged data state instead. Corollary: process-local fault injection and in-process telemetry cannot gate work any process may perform — use them as stress amplifiers (arm → bounded window → disarm → assert convergence), never as preconditions.
- **Keep domain concepts out of generic/shared/infrastructure layers.** Reusable layer (shared library, framework, infra module) must reference NO consumer-specific domain concept — tenant/customer/product IDs, business entities, feature rules. Leak compiles + runs → passes review silently while coupling the "reusable" layer to one consumer. Keep shared type domain-free; push domain fields/logic down into the consumer via subclass/composition. — why: a layer coupled to one consumer's domain is no longer reusable.
