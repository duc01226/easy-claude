## Codex Project-Reference Loading (No Hooks)

Codex uses static project-reference loading instead of runtime-injected project docs.
When coding, planning, debugging, testing, or reviewing, open project docs explicitly using this routing.

**Always read:**
- `docs/project-config.json` (project-specific paths, commands, modules, and workflow/test settings)
- `docs/project-reference/docs-index-reference.md` (routes to the full `docs/project-reference/*` catalog)
- `docs/project-reference/lessons.md` (always-on guardrails and anti-patterns)

**Missing/stale context route:** If `docs/project-config.json`, the docs index, `lessons.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, or any task-required reference doc is missing or stale, auto-run `$project-init` or the narrow setup route (`$project-config`, `$docs-init`, `$scan-all`, `$scan --target=<key>`, `$claude-md-init`) before ordinary project-specific work. If Codex mirrors or `AGENTS.md` are missing/stale, ask the user to run `$sync-codex`; do not auto-run it.

**Situation-based docs:**
- Project structure/architecture/tech-stack/deployment/setup (any layer — backend, frontend, or infra): `project-structure-reference.md`
- Backend/CQRS/API/domain/entity changes: `backend-patterns-reference.md`, `domain-entities-reference.md`
- Frontend/UI/styling/design-system: `frontend-patterns-reference.md`, `scss-styling-guide.md`, `design-system/README.md`
- Spec authoring, `docs/specs/` pathing, or TC format: `feature-spec-reference.md`, `spec-system-reference.md`, `spec-principles.md`
- Behavior/public-contract changes or spec-test-code sync: `workflow-spec-test-code-cycle-reference.md` plus the spec docs above
- Derived spec indexes/ERDs/reimplementation guides: `spec-system-reference.md` and source Feature Specs under `docs/specs/`
- Integration test implementation/review: `integration-test-reference.md`
- E2E test implementation/review: `e2e-test-reference.md`
- Code review/audit work: `code-review-rules.md` plus domain docs above based on changed files

Do not read all docs blindly. Start from `docs-index-reference.md`, then open only relevant files for the task.

## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Drive a review target to a **clean zero-findings pass** by pairing `$why-review` with `$fix` in a recursive loop — each round runs `$why-review` INLINE to surface validated findings, then `$fix` to resolve them, then loops again over the CHANGED target — stopping only when a complete `$why-review` pass produces **zero findings** (nothing left to fix).

**Summary:**

- **Each round = `$why-review` + `$fix`** — `$why-review` is review-ONLY and never edits the target, so the loop MUST pair it with a fix half; one without the other never converges.
- **Steps (in order):** (0) resolve target + Goal Contract → (0b) bind the convergence loop (protocol loop primary + optional `/goal` accelerator) → (1) round loop { run `$why-review` INLINE → clear the **Trade-Off Gate** on the fix set → run `$fix` on the VALIDATED findings at the owning layer → log iteration } → (2) converge on a zero-findings round OR escalate on non-progress → (3) recap.
- **Convergence:** stop ONLY when a **fresh full** `$why-review` over the CURRENT (post-fix) target returns a PASS verdict with an **empty validated-finding set** — not a stale PASS predating the last fix.
- **Inline invariant:** run `$why-review` via the skill invocation, NEVER the `spawn_agent` tool — it self-binds its OWN review-loop obligation (and a session `/goal` gate WHEN available, `why-review/SKILL.md:57-76`), which a sub-agent cannot own or carry back to this loop.
- **Apply ONLY validated findings:** `$why-review` already validates its findings to the ≥85% survival bar; the loop applies THOSE, at the lowest owning layer (Entity > Service > Handler), routed by target type — NEVER unvalidated findings.
- **Bounded:** round cap default 5; findings not shrinking across 2 rounds, or cap hit with findings still open → **STOP & escalate** by asking the user directly. Increasing findings → STOP (fixes regressing).
- **TRADE-OFF GATE before every fix (ALWAYS ASK):** (1) **is there any trade-off in this fix?** name what it sacrifices — "none" is an unfinished analysis; (2) **is it worth it?** gain vs cost, who pays, when → WORTH IT / NOT WORTH IT / UNCLEAR — NOT WORTH IT → do NOT apply, report it back instead; (3) **is the trade-off material enough to confirm with the user?** irreversible · cost shifted elsewhere · quality attribute traded · boundary crossed · high-consequence path · UNCLEAR → **STOP the loop and confirm by asking the user directly BEFORE applying**. NEVER auto-apply a material-trade-off fix just because the loop wants to converge.

**Why this skill exists (READ FIRST — it is the whole justification):** `$why-review` is **review-only** — `why-review/SKILL.md:330` (*"Review only — do NOT modify target files or implement changes"*) and `:76` (*"why-review fixes its OWN findings set, not code… Code/spec/test fixes remain the caller's job"*). Its internal self-recursive `/goal` loop (`why-review/SKILL.md:57-76`) converges its own **findings REPORT** to CLEAN — every surviving finding proof-backed, validated, ≥85% confidence — but it **never touches the code and never re-reviews a fixed target**. So a finding that demands a code/spec/doc change is validated and handed off, yet **nothing loops back to confirm the FIX is correct or that it introduced no new defect**. This skill closes that outer loop: it applies the validated fixes and re-runs a **fresh full** `$why-review` over the changed target until zero findings remain — catching fix-induced regressions and proving each fix actually resolved its finding. Without it, "why-review passed, then I fixed the findings" ships those fixes unreviewed.

**Workflow:** resolve target + Goal Contract → bind the convergence loop (protocol loop + optional `/goal` accelerator) → **round loop** { run `$why-review` INLINE → clear the Trade-Off Gate on the fix set (trade-off? worth it? material → confirm with user) → run `$fix` on the validated findings at owning layer → log iteration } → converge when a fresh full review yields zero findings → recap.

**Key Rules:**

- **Each round pairs `$why-review` (find) + `$fix` (resolve).** `$why-review` is review-only (`why-review/SKILL.md:76,330`) — it produces validated findings but never edits the target; `$fix` is the half that lands the change. A round is incomplete until BOTH have run (or the review returned zero findings).
- **MUST run INLINE in the main session — NEVER dispatch `$why-review` as a sub-agent.** It self-binds its own review-loop obligation (and a session `/goal` gate when available, `why-review/SKILL.md:57-76`); as a sub-agent that in-session guarantee is silently lost. This loop skill therefore also runs inline.
- **Convergence = a fresh full `$why-review` over the post-fix target returns PASS with an empty validated-finding set.** A PASS produced BEFORE the latest fix landed does NOT count — re-review the changed target.
- **`$fix` applies ONLY validated findings**, at the lowest owning layer, routed by target type (code → `$fix` with its intelligent routing, or a direct edit at Entity/Service; plan/PBI → `$refine`; spec → `$spec [update]` + `$spec [mode=tests]`; docs → `$docs-update`; tests → `$integration-test`). NEVER apply an unvalidated or demoted finding.
- **The target base is FIXED across rounds; its content changes as fixes land.** Re-review the SAME target (same plan/diff/artifact) each round so convergence is measured against a stable subject.
- **Round cap (default 5)** and **findings-not-shrinking / increasing → STOP & escalate** by asking the user directly. NEVER loop open-ended.
- **ALWAYS ask the 3 trade-off questions before applying ANY fix** — is there a trade-off? is it worth it? is it material enough to confirm with the user? A MATERIAL trade-off (irreversible · cost shifted to another team/ops/maintainer/user · one quality attribute traded for another · tier/service/event/library boundary crossed · auth/money/data-integrity/breaking-change path · worth-it verdict UNCLEAR) **PAUSES the loop for an ask the user directly before the fix lands** — convergence pressure NEVER authorizes walking through a one-way door on the user's behalf. — why: an autonomous fix loop is exactly where an unpriced trade-off ships silently, because each round only asks "did findings shrink?".

---

## First Principle — Convergence, Not Motion

> A round that changes the target is progress **only if** the next fresh review finds fewer things to fix.
> The loop exists to reach a fixed point (zero findings), not to keep editing the target.
> If findings stop shrinking, that is a signal to **escalate**, not to spin another round.

---

## Step 0 — Resolve Target + Goal Contract (FIRST ACTION)

1. **Parse the review target** from the user prompt into a stable, reusable target reference — exactly the kinds `$why-review` resolves (`why-review/SKILL.md:142-161`):
   - **Plan / PBI / story** — a `plan.md` + `phase-*.md` dir, or a named PBI/story artifact.
   - **Code change** — a commit SHA, PR/merge commit, branch-to-branch or PR diff (e.g. `git diff develop...HEAD`), or uncommitted working-tree changes.
   - **Docs / spec / report** — a target artifact path whose claims are checked against source evidence.
   - Record the target type, its evidence, and confidence. **NEVER silently convert target types** (`why-review/SKILL.md:160`).
2. **Resolve/create the Goal Contract** per `SYNC:goal-contract-satisfaction-loop` (`plans/goals/{YYMMDD-HHmm}-{slug}/goal.md`, template `.claude/templates/goal-contract-template.md`). Its single **required** Success Criterion:
   > *A fresh full `$why-review` over `{target}` returns a PASS verdict with **zero validated findings** (no finding, weakness, or missing item of any severity).*
   Record the round cap (default 5) and the target reference in **Constraints**.

## Step 0b — Bind the Convergence Loop (protocol-first; `/goal` is an optional accelerator)

The convergence loop is bound by TWO layers. The **protocol loop (Steps 1–2) is the BINDING mechanism** and MUST be self-driven by you, the running agent, on every host — with or without any command or hook. The **`/goal` command is an OPTIONAL accelerator** layered on top; it is never the primary mechanism, and its absence NEVER weakens the loop. This mirrors the project rule that hooks/trackers are accelerators only — correctness must not depend on them.

**1. Protocol loop — ALWAYS binding (hook/command-independent).** You are personally responsible for not stopping until the loop converges or bounded-escalates. This binds Claude, Codex, and Copilot equally, whether or not `/goal` exists:

> Repeatedly run `$why-review` INLINE over `{target}`. After each review, apply every VALIDATED finding's fix at its owning layer, then re-run a FRESH full `$why-review` over the CHANGED target. Do NOT stop while the last review still produced findings. Converge ONLY when a fresh full `$why-review` returns PASS with zero validated findings. Cap at `{N=5}` rounds; if findings do not shrink across 2 consecutive rounds, findings increase, or the cap is hit with findings still open → STOP and escalate by asking the user directly. Never loop open-ended.

Treat this as a standing obligation you re-read at every Step 2 checkpoint — NOT a one-time note you can rationalize away after the first fix cycle. The Goal Contract's required Success Criterion (Step 0) is its durable, host-independent record.

**2. `/goal` command — invoke as an accelerator WHEN AVAILABLE.** If a `/goal` command exists and you are permitted to run it in this environment, ALSO invoke it (a real tool/command call, NOT a paraphrase, NOT a Goal Contract file substituted for it) with the SAME condition, so a session Stop hook mechanically enforces the loop:

```
/goal why-review convergence loop: repeatedly run $why-review INLINE over {target}. After each review, apply every VALIDATED finding's fix at its owning layer, then re-run a FRESH full $why-review over the CHANGED target. If findings>0 → apply fixes and run another round; if a fresh full $why-review returns PASS with zero validated findings → CONVERGED, clear the gate. Do NOT stop while the last review still produced findings. Cap at {N=5} rounds; if findings do not shrink across 2 consecutive rounds, findings increase, or the cap is hit with findings still open → STOP and escalate by asking the user directly. Never loop open-ended.
```

The `/goal` Stop hook blocks stopping until the condition holds and auto-clears when met — do not tell the user to clear it.

**If `/goal` is unavailable, unregistered, or not permitted** (e.g. Codex/Copilot, or a Claude run without the command): DO NOT error, DO NOT block, and DO NOT invent a stand-in gate. Record ONE line in the Goal Contract — `/goal accelerator unavailable — loop bound by protocol (Steps 1–2) + this Goal Contract` — and proceed. The protocol loop above plus the Goal Contract are the same gate, enforced by discipline instead of a hook.

> **Nested gates (by design, safe):** each inner `$why-review` round self-binds its OWN review-loop obligation (and installs its own `/goal` gate WHEN available, `why-review/SKILL.md:57-76`) that clears when THAT round's findings are all validated CLEAN. This OUTER loop persists across rounds and **subsumes** the inner ones (a converged loop implies every inner round ended with validated findings). All self-clear on satisfaction — no orphaned gate. Do NOT tell the user to clear either.

## Step 1 — Round Loop (`$why-review` → `$fix` → log)

Each round couples the two halves — **review to find, fix to resolve.** For each round `R` (starting at 1), do ALL of:

1. **Run `$why-review` INLINE** on `{target}` via the skill invocation (NEVER the `spawn_agent` tool). Let it run its full adversarial review + its own internal Findings Validation Gate, so the findings it returns are already **validated** (proof-backed, ≥85% survival bar).
2. **Read the validated finding set** from its report (`plans/reports/why-review-*.md`). If the verdict is PASS with **zero** findings → this round converged; go to Step 2 (no fix half needed).
3. **Trade-Off Gate on the fix set (BLOCKING — before any edit lands).** For EACH validated finding's fix, ask the 3 questions: (a) **is there any trade-off?** name what applying it sacrifices — future change cost, complexity, performance, coupling, reversibility, migration/ops burden, blast radius, security, testability, delivery time; "none" is an unfinished analysis, so state the dimensions checked; (b) **is it worth it?** gain vs cost, who pays, when → **WORTH IT / NOT WORTH IT / UNCLEAR**; NOT WORTH IT → do NOT apply — report the finding back as a withdrawn-fix note and count it as still-open, never as fixed; (c) **is the trade-off material enough to confirm with the user?** MATERIAL when irreversible (one-way door) · cost shifted onto another team/ops/maintainer/user · one quality attribute traded for another · a tier/service/event/library boundary crossed · an auth/money/data-integrity/breaking-change path · or the verdict is UNCLEAR → **PAUSE the loop and confirm by asking the user directly BEFORE the edit**, stating the trade-off, both options, what each sacrifices, and your recommendation. Log each fix's trade-off verdict in the round's Iteration Log entry. — why: the loop's only convergence signal is "did findings shrink?", so a material trade-off rides in unpriced unless a gate stops the fix half specifically.
4. **Run `$fix` on the validated findings** (findings>0 only, trade-off gate cleared) — this is the half `$why-review` never does. Resolve each validated finding at its owning layer: code → `$fix` (its `--target` intelligent routing) or a direct edit at the lowest layer (Entity > Service > Handler); plan/PBI → `$refine`; spec → `$spec [update]` + `$spec [mode=tests]`; docs → `$docs-update`; behavior-changing → honor the finding's dual-feedback (spec verdict + test action per `why-review/SKILL.md:360`). Fix ONLY validated findings — never an unvalidated or demoted one.
5. **Append an Iteration Log entry** to the Goal Contract: round number, findings count (validated), files/artifacts changed this round (`file:line`), fixes applied, per-fix trade-off verdict (WORTH IT / NOT WORTH IT / UNCLEAR + material? + confirmed?), and remaining gaps.

## Step 2 — Convergence & Escalation Gate

Evaluate after every round:

| Condition | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Fresh full `$why-review` returned **PASS with zero validated findings** | **CONVERGED** → mark the required criterion PASS in the Goal Satisfaction matrix → clear the `/goal` gate → go to Step 3. |
| Findings > 0 AND round `< N` AND findings shrank vs prior round | Clear the Trade-Off Gate (Step 1.3), apply the validated fixes (Step 1.4), then run round `R+1` (fresh full re-review of the changed target). |
| A fix carries a **MATERIAL** trade-off (irreversible · cost shifted elsewhere · quality attribute traded · boundary crossed · high-consequence path · worth-it UNCLEAR) | **PAUSE the loop → confirm by asking the user directly BEFORE applying that fix.** Convergence pressure NEVER authorizes deciding a material trade-off for the user. |
| Findings did **not shrink** across 2 consecutive rounds (same/increasing count) | **STOP & escalate** by asking the user directly — a non-converging loop is a signal, not a reason to spin. |
| Round cap `N` hit with findings still open | **STOP & escalate** by asking the user directly — report the still-open findings; do not silently continue. |

> **Increasing findings = STOP.** If round `R` surfaces MORE findings than round `R-1`, the fixes are regressing the target — STOP and escalate immediately. Never trade one fix for two new findings across rounds.

## Step 3 — Recap

Emit a concise convergence recap: rounds run, validated findings per round (the shrinking sequence), the fixes applied at each round, the final zero-findings PASS evidence, and the Goal Satisfaction matrix (required criterion PASS). Point to each round's `$why-review` report under `plans/reports/` and the Goal Contract Iteration Log. Do NOT commit or push unless the user explicitly asks.

---

## Convergence Detection — Why a Fresh Full Re-Review Is Required

A round converges ONLY when a `$why-review` that ran over the **current, post-fix** target returns PASS with an empty validated-finding set. Both properties are required because:

- **Fresh over the changed target** — a PASS verdict from a review that predates the last fix proves nothing about the fix. Every applied fix invalidates the prior verdict (`why-review/SKILL.md:565`); the loop MUST re-review after fixing, never reuse a stale clean verdict.
- **Zero *validated* findings** — `$why-review`'s own gate already dropped inflated/unproven findings below the ≥85% bar (`why-review/SKILL.md:361`); convergence rides on that validated set, so the loop never chases a nit the review itself would demote.

When findings remain but cannot be fixed (owner/product input needed) → **escalate**, do not loop. When a fix lands but the next fresh review still finds issues → run another round. Convergence is a fixed point, not a single clean read.

---

**IMPORTANT MANDATORY sequence:** Step 0 (resolve target + Goal Contract) → Step 0b (bind the convergence loop: protocol loop primary + optional `/goal` accelerator) → Step 1 (round loop: run `$why-review` INLINE → clear the Trade-Off Gate on the fix set → run `$fix` on validated findings → log) → Step 2 (converge on a zero-findings fresh review / escalate on non-progress) → Step 3 (recap).

- **MANDATORY MUST ATTENTION ALWAYS ASK THE 3 TRADE-OFF QUESTIONS** — on the thing under review AND on every recommendation you make: (1) **is there any trade-off?** name what it SACRIFICES (change cost · complexity · perf · coupling · reversibility · migration · ops load · blast radius · security · testability · delivery time · UX) — "none"/"pure win" is an unfinished analysis, so state the dimensions checked; (2) **is it worth it?** gain (with a metric) vs cost, WHO pays, WHEN → emit **WORTH IT / NOT WORTH IT / UNCLEAR**; NOT WORTH IT → withdraw or replace it; (3) **is it material enough to confirm with the user?** irreversible/one-way door · cost shifted onto another team/ops/maintainer/user · one quality attribute traded for another · a tier/service/event/library boundary crossed · auth/money/data-integrity/breaking-change/High-or-Medium-risk path · verdict UNCLEAR → **STOP and confirm by asking the user directly BEFORE the verdict**.
- **MANDATORY** A MATERIAL trade-off with no user confirmation can NEVER be PASS; NEVER bury one as a Low-severity note, NEVER decide it silently, and NEVER let delivery or convergence pressure authorize a one-way door. — why: an un-walked-back one-way door is the user's call to make, not the reviewer's.
- **MANDATORY — non-asking contexts escalate BY HANDOFF, never by silence.** ask the user directly reaches only the main interactive agent: a sub-agent cannot ask the user, and a terminal/verdict-only mode asks nothing by design. There the duty is REDIRECTED, not waived — still name the trade-off, still decide materiality, record `confirmed? = NO — cannot ask from this context`, **state the unconfirmed MATERIAL trade-off in your RETURNED verdict/summary so the CALLER escalates it** (a note only in an on-disk report is not a handoff), and never emit an unqualified PASS. Applies ONLY where the user is genuinely unreachable (spawned sub-agent, terminal validate mode, headless run) — if you CAN ask, you MUST ask.

## Closing Reminders

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION Goal:** Pair `$why-review` + `$fix` in a recursive loop over a fixed target — review to find validated findings → `$fix` to resolve them → fresh full re-review of the CHANGED target — until a complete `$why-review` pass produces **zero findings** (nothing left to fix).

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION main steps (in order):** (0) resolve target + Goal Contract → (0b) bind the convergence loop (protocol loop primary + optional `/goal` accelerator) → (1) round loop: run `$why-review` INLINE → clear the **Trade-Off Gate** on the fix set (trade-off? worth it? material → confirm with user) → run `$fix` on VALIDATED findings at owning layer → append Iteration Log → (2) converge on a zero-findings fresh review / escalate on non-progress → (3) recap.

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION ALWAYS ASK THE 3 TRADE-OFF QUESTIONS BEFORE EVERY FIX LANDS:** (1) **Is there any trade-off?** name what applying this fix SACRIFICES across future change cost · complexity · performance · coupling · reversibility · migration/ops burden · blast radius · security · testability · delivery time — "none" is an unfinished analysis, so state the dimensions checked and why each is unaffected; (2) **Is it worth it?** gain (with a metric) vs cost, WHO pays, WHEN it comes due → emit **WORTH IT / NOT WORTH IT / UNCLEAR**; NOT WORTH IT → do NOT apply the fix, report it back as withdrawn and count the finding still-open (never as fixed); (3) **Is the trade-off material enough to confirm with the user?** MATERIAL when irreversible (one-way door) · cost shifted onto another team/ops/maintainer/user · one quality attribute traded for another · a tier/service/event/library boundary crossed · an auth/money/data-integrity/breaking-change path · or the verdict is UNCLEAR → **PAUSE the loop and confirm by asking the user directly BEFORE the edit lands**, stating the trade-off, both options, what each sacrifices, and your recommendation. Log every fix's trade-off verdict in the round's Iteration Log. — why: this loop's only convergence signal is "did findings shrink?", so an unpriced or one-way-door fix ships silently unless a gate stops the fix half specifically; convergence pressure NEVER authorizes deciding a material trade-off on the user's behalf.

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION [BLOCKING] plan the detailed todo tasks FIRST — before running the loop.** Before the first round, create a detailed todo-task plan that enumerates every planned step and every planned round; a round MUST NOT start until that round's fresh todo-task plan exists. On EVERY re-run (each new round), REGENERATE a fresh loop todo-task plan — NEVER reuse the prior round's task list — so each round's work is explicitly planned before it executes.

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** each round pairs `$why-review` (find) + `$fix` (resolve); `$why-review` is review-only (`why-review/SKILL.md:76,330`) and never edits the target, so the loop MUST run the `$fix` half — one without the other never converges.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** the convergence loop is bound by the **AI-driven protocol loop (Steps 1–2) — that is the primary, host-independent mechanism you MUST self-drive whether or not any command exists.** The `/goal` command is an OPTIONAL accelerator: invoke it (a real call) ONLY when available and permitted; if it is absent/unregistered/not-permitted, record one line in the Goal Contract and proceed — NEVER error, block, or fake a gate. Correctness must not depend on `/goal`.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** run `$why-review` **INLINE via the skill invocation — NEVER as a sub-agent** (it self-binds its own review-loop obligation + a session `/goal` gate when available, `why-review/SKILL.md:57-76`).
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** convergence = a **fresh full** `$why-review` over the **post-fix** target returns PASS with an **empty validated-finding set** — never a stale clean verdict predating the last fix.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** apply **ONLY validated findings** (≥85% survival bar) at the lowest owning layer (Entity > Service > Handler); NEVER apply an unvalidated or demoted finding.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** enforce the **round cap (default 5)**; findings not shrinking across 2 rounds, increasing, or cap hit with findings still open → **STOP & escalate** by asking the user directly. NEVER loop open-ended.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** do NOT commit or push unless the user explicitly asks.

## Hookless Prompt Protocol Mirror (Auto-Synced)

Source: `.claude/.ck.json` + `.claude/skills/shared/sync-inline-versions.md` (`:full` blocks) + `.claude/scripts/lib/hookless-prompt-protocol.cjs`

## [WORKFLOW-EXECUTION-PROTOCOL] [BLOCKING] Workflow Execution Protocol — MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST CRITICAL. Do not skip for any reason.

**Generic portability boundary:** Reusable skills and protocol text stay project-neutral; project-specific conventions are discovered from docs/project-config.json and docs/project-reference/. Apply shared AI-SDD from `shared/sdd-artifact-contract.md`. Read `docs/project-config.json` and `docs/project-reference/docs-index-reference.md`, then open the project reference docs named there. For spec, test-case, behavior-change, public-contract, or `docs/specs/` work, route through the local spec docs named by the docs index: `feature-spec-reference.md`, `spec-system-reference.md`, `spec-principles.md`, and `workflow-spec-test-code-cycle-reference.md` when specs/tests/code must stay synchronized. If either file or a required reference doc is missing or stale, auto-run `$project-init` (or the narrow lower-level route such as `$project-config`, `$docs-init`, `$scan-all`, or `$scan --target=<key>`) before ordinary project-specific work. Any supported AI tool may execute when this shared context and local docs are available.

1. **DETECT:** If the prompt starts with an explicit slash skill/workflow command, execute it directly. Otherwise match the prompt against the workflow catalog and skill list.
2. **ANALYZE:** Choose the best option: execute directly, invoke a skill, activate a standard workflow, or compose a custom step combination.
3. **AUTO-SELECT:** Pick the best option yourself. Do not ask the user to choose between direct execution, skill, standard workflow, or custom workflow.
4. **ACTIVATE:** For a selected workflow, call `$start-workflow <workflowId>`; for a selected skill, invoke that skill; for a custom workflow, sequence custom steps directly; for direct execution, proceed with the task.
5. **CREATE TASKS:** task tracking for ALL workflow/skill/custom steps before execution when the selected path has multiple steps.
6. **EXECUTE:** Advance per the **Workflow Step Advancement & Parallel Phases** rule in your context instructions — model-driven; a sub-agent completion advances a step identically to an inline call; a parallel-phase group is an all-return barrier (advance only after ALL members return, never serialize it)

## SYNC:ai-sdd-artifact-contract:reminder

- **MANDATORY** Apply `shared/sdd-artifact-contract.md`; keep reusable AI-SDD in `.claude` and local rules in project docs.
- **MANDATORY** Code-to-spec extraction is reference-only until canonical acceptance; any supported AI tool may execute with synced context.
- **MANDATORY** Update `.claude` source before syncing generated mirrors; do not manually edit `.agents`, `.codex`, or `AGENTS.md`.
- **MANDATORY** Missing or stale project config, root instruction files, or required reference docs route project-specific work through `$project-init` or the narrow setup route automatically.
**[TASK-PLANNING] [MANDATORY]** BEFORE executing any workflow or skill step, create/update task tracking for all planned steps, then keep it synchronized as each step starts/completes.
## [LESSON-LEARNED-REMINDER] [BLOCKING] Task Planning & Continuous Improvement — MANDATORY. Do not skip.

Break work into small tasks (task tracking) before starting. Add final task: "Analyze AI mistakes & lessons learned".

**Extract lessons — ROOT CAUSE ONLY, not symptom fixes:**
1. Name the FAILURE MODE (reasoning/assumption failure), not symptom — "assumed API existed without reading source" not "used wrong enum value".
2. Generality test: does this failure mode apply to ≥3 contexts/codebases? If not, abstract one level up.
3. Write as a universal rule — strip project-specific names/paths/classes. Useful on any codebase.
4. Consolidate: multiple mistakes sharing one failure mode → ONE lesson.
5. **Recurrence gate:** "Would this recur in future session WITHOUT this reminder?" — No → skip `$learn`.
6. **Auto-fix gate:** "Could `$code-review`/`$code-simplifier`/`$security-review`/`$lint` catch this?" — Yes → improve review skill instead.
7. BOTH gates pass → ask user to run `$learn`.
**[CRITICAL-THINKING-MINDSET]** Apply critical thinking, sequential thinking. Every claim needs traced proof, confidence >80% to act.
**Anti-hallucination principle:** Never present guess as fact — cite sources for every claim, admit uncertainty freely, self-check output for errors, cross-reference independently, stay skeptical of own confidence — certainty without evidence root of all hallucination.
**AI Attention principle (Primacy-Recency):** Put the 3 most critical rules at both top and bottom of long prompts/protocols so instruction adherence survives long context windows.
**Goal-driven execution:** Define success criteria first, loop until verified, and stop only when observable checks pass.
**Tests verify intent:** Tests must protect business rules/invariants and fail when the protected intent breaks, not only mirror current behavior.
## Common AI Mistake Prevention (System Lessons)

- **Re-read files after context compaction.** Edit requires prior Read in same context; compaction wipes read state. Re-read before editing.
- **Grep for old terms after bulk replacements.** AI over-trusts find/replace completeness. Grep full repo after bulk edits for missed refs in docs/configs/catalogs.
- **Check downstream references before deleting.** Deletions cascade doc/code staleness. Map referencing files before removal.
- **After memory loss, check existing state before creating new.** Compaction wipes prior-work memory. Query current state to resume — never blindly duplicate.
- **Verify AI-generated content against actual code.** AI hallucinates APIs, class names, method signatures. Grep to confirm existence before documenting/referencing.
- **Trace full dependency chain after edits.** Changing a definition misses downstream consumers. Trace the full chain.
- **When renaming, grep ALL consumer file types.** Some file types silently ignore missing refs (no compile error). Search code, templates, configs, generated files.
- **Trace ALL code paths when verifying correctness.** Code existing ≠ code executing. Trace early exits, error branches, conditional skips — not just happy path.
- **Update docs that embed canonical data when source changes.** Docs inlining derived data (workflows, schemas, configs) go stale silently. Update all embedding docs alongside source.
- **Verify sub-agent results after context recovery.** Background agents may finish while parent compacted — grep-verify output, don't trust assumed completion.
- **Cross-check full target list against sub-agent assignments.** Parallel sub-agents by category miss boundary items. Reconcile union of assignments against target list before proceeding.
- **Sub-agents inherit knowledge only from their agent .md definition — use custom agent types, not built-in Explore.** Tool adoption = permission + knowledge + enforcement (numbered workflow step).
- **Persist sub-agent findings incrementally, not as a final batch.** Long sub-agents hit cutoffs before final write — findings lost. Instruct append-per-section to report file.
- **When debugging, ask "whose responsibility?" before fixing.** Trace caller (wrong data) vs callee (wrong handling). Fix at responsible layer — never patch symptom site.
- **Test failure → adjudicate WHO is at fault (source vs test) before forcing green.** A green-again suite is not the goal; the correct verdict on what was actually wrong is. Root-cause first, then triangulate the failure against the governing spec (`docs/specs/**` if one exists) AND the source: SOURCE-WRONG → fix code at the owning layer and keep/strengthen the test; TEST-WRONG → fix the stale assertion/setup at its root. NEVER weaken an assertion, add a skip, or relax a timeout to force green, and never change source to satisfy a broken test. Spec silent or ambiguous about which side is correct → STOP and ask the user.
- **Grep ALL removed names after extraction/refactoring.** Primary file "done" ≠ secondary files clean. Grep entire scope for every removed symbol before declaring complete.
- **Assume existing values are intentional — ask WHY before changing OR flagging one as a defect.** Pattern-matching as "wrong" skips context. Before changing or reporting any constant/limit/flag/cutoff: read comments, git blame, the CALLER's ordering (the guarantee that makes the value correct usually lives in code running immediately BEFORE the cited line), and 2+ sibling call sites of the same convention. A doc stating WHAT without WHY is missing rationale, not proof of a missing guard — and in a validation pass, an accurate `file:line` citation proves the transcription, never the defect.
- **Verify ALL affected outputs, not just the first.** One build green ≠ all green. Multi-stack changes (backend/frontend/tests/docs) require verifying EVERY output.
- **Evaluate fit before copying a nearby pattern.** Closest example ≠ matching preconditions — verify the new context shares the same constraints, base classes, scope, lifetime.
- **Holistic-first debugging — resist nearest-attention trap.** Don't dive into first plausible cause. List EVERY precondition (config, env vars, paths, DB, endpoints, creds, versions, DI, data). Verify each against evidence (grep/query — not reasoning). Ask "what would falsify this?" — if nothing, it's not a hypothesis. Most expensive failure: going deeper in "obvious" layer while bug sits in layer never questioned.
- **Surgical changes — apply the diff test (context-aware).** Two modes: (1) Bug fix → every line traces to the bug; no restyling; orphan cleanup only for imports YOUR changes made unused. (2) Review/enhancement → implement improvements AND announce as "Enhancement beyond main request: [what]". Never silently scope-creep. Diff test: "Would this line exist if I wasn't asked to do X?" — if no, delete or announce.
- **Surface ambiguity before coding — don't pick silently.** Multiple valid interpretations → present each with effort: "[Request] could mean (1) [N h], (2) [N h]. Which matters?" List scope/format/volume/constraints assumptions first. If simpler path exists, say so. Never silently pick.
- **[MANDATORY FIRST ACTION] ALWAYS activate a suitable skill or workflow BEFORE responding.** Match task against workflow catalog + skill list; invoke via skill invocation or `$start-workflow <workflowId>`. NEVER answer or write code before checking. Skip = protocol violation.
- **Why-Review adversarial mindset — apply when reviewing any plan, decision, or design.** Default SKEPTIC not VALIDATOR: steel-man a rejected alternative, invert each stated reason ("what does it sacrifice?"), stress-test top 2-3 assumptions, run pre-mortem ("ships, fails in 3 months — what breaks?"), surface 1-2 alternatives author missed. Section presence ≠ quality; quality = causal reasoning + concrete mitigations + evidence, not "it's better" or "monitor closely".
- **Front-load report-write in sub-agent prompts for large reviews.** Many-file sub-agents hit budget before final write — findings lost. Design prompts so: (1) report-write is first explicit deliverable, (2) append per-file/section (not batched), (3) scope bounded so reads don't exhaust budget. Truncated mid-sentence with no report file → spawn narrower scope, don't retry same prompt.
- **After context compaction, re-verify all prior phase outcomes before continuing.** Summaries describe intent, not environment state (git index, filesystem, processes). On resume, FIRST audit: git status, re-read modified files, verify filesystem. Every "completed" claim is an untested hypothesis until evidence confirms.
- **OOM/memory: check row count before row size.** Triage: (1) Unbounded query — no DB filter for trigger? Push filter to DB; eliminates OOM. (2) Large rows? Projection reduces proportionally. Row reduction > projection in ROI.
- **Keep domain concepts out of generic/shared/infrastructure layers.** Reusable layer (shared library, framework, infra module) must reference NO consumer-specific domain concept — tenant/customer/product IDs, business entities, feature rules. Leak compiles + runs → passes review silently while coupling the "reusable" layer to one consumer. Keep shared type domain-free; push domain fields/logic down into the consumer via subclass/composition. — why: a layer coupled to one consumer's domain is no longer reusable.
