## Codex Project-Reference Loading (No Hooks)

Codex uses static project-reference loading instead of runtime-injected project docs.
When coding, planning, debugging, testing, or reviewing, open project docs explicitly using this routing.

**Always read:**
- `docs/project-config.json` (project-specific paths, commands, modules, and workflow/test settings)
- `docs/project-reference/docs-index-reference.md` (routes to the full `docs/project-reference/*` catalog)
- `docs/project-reference/lessons.md` (always-on guardrails and anti-patterns)

**Missing/stale context route:** If `docs/project-config.json`, the docs index, `lessons.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, or any task-required reference doc is missing or stale, auto-run `$project-init` or the narrow setup route (`$project-config`, `$docs-init`, `$scan-all`, `$scan --target=<key>`, `$claude-md-init`) before ordinary project-specific work. If Codex mirrors or `AGENTS.md` are missing/stale, ask the user to run `$sync-codex`; do not auto-run it.

**Situation-based docs:**
- Project structure/architecture/tech-stack/deployment/setup (any layer — backend, frontend, or infra): `project-structure-reference.md`
- Backend/CQRS/API/domain/entity changes: `backend-patterns-reference.md`, `domain-entities-reference.md`
- Frontend/UI/styling/design-system: `frontend-patterns-reference.md`, `scss-styling-guide.md`, `design-system/README.md`
- Spec authoring, `docs/specs/` pathing, or TC format: `feature-spec-reference.md`, `spec-system-reference.md`, `spec-principles.md`
- Behavior/public-contract changes or spec-test-code sync: `workflow-spec-test-code-cycle-reference.md` plus the spec docs above
- Derived spec indexes/ERDs/reimplementation guides: `spec-system-reference.md` and source Feature Specs under `docs/specs/`
- Integration test implementation/review: `integration-test-reference.md`
- E2E test implementation/review: `e2e-test-reference.md`
- Code review/audit work: `code-review-rules.md` plus domain docs above based on changed files

Do not read all docs blindly. Start from `docs-index-reference.md`, then open only relevant files for the task.

## Quick Summary

> **Portability:** the technical root is read from `docs/project-config.json` → `specRoots.technical.path` (declared `authorship: "derived"`, `m1Policy: "exempt"`). NEVER hardcode a root. `{TechRoot}/{Service}/{Component}.md` is a **pattern** — `{Service}` and `{Component}` are placeholders resolved from the repo, never literal names.

**[IMPORTANT] task tracking** — Break ALL work into small tasks BEFORE starting (one task per emitted artifact).

**Goal:** Generate, on demand, a regenerable single-writer **technical view** — per-component derived specs (use-case inventory, TC↔test map, cross-service topology) — **projected FROM** code and test annotations (`TestSpec` for business TC joins, `TechnicalSpec` for technical-only joins when present), so an engineer can read a component's technical surface without ever forking a second, hand-maintained source of truth. **Code and tests are the source of truth; this skill only projects them.**

**Summary:**

- **Purpose:** a DERIVED-view **generator** ONLY — greps handlers/consumers/jobs/producers and test annotations to emit `{TechRoot}/{Service}/{Component}.md`; it **NEVER authors business content**. Code + tests stay the source of truth.
- **Main steps (run in order):** **Step 0** Scope Gate — ask the user directly (service/component + mode), BLOCKING before any read; no source to derive from → STOP. **Step 1** Derive facts — grep the use-case inventory, the `TestSpec`/`TechnicalSpec` joins, the topology. **Step 2** Instantiate templates — `references/author.md`'s fixed sections in pinned order. **Step 3** Stamp & Write — DERIVED banner + regenerate date, write each artifact immediately (never accumulate in context). **Step 4** Verify — no retired artifacts, banner present, no business artifact types, no canonical claims, no secrets.
- **Modes:** `generate` (default — regenerate the derived view) · `audit` (report which views are stale vs code/tests) · `sync` (report canonical §8 TC ↔ executing test-code drift — `references/sync.md`).
- Hard prohibition is the load-bearing rule: never emit the retired A-E engineering tree, `M##` dirs, `00-module-registry.md`, `01-domain-erd.md`, or `06-reimplementation-guide.md` under the technical root — why: an A-E bundle becomes a second source of truth competing with the Feature Spec, and a generator able to recreate it resurrects the retired tree on its next run (this has occurred once already, via rebase).
- Every generated file carries the `> DERIVED — regenerate with the tech-spec skill; do NOT hand-edit` banner + a regenerate date, anchors each fact back to its source, and makes **no canonical claim**.
- **This skill is M1-EXEMPT** (`specRoots.technical.m1Policy: "exempt"`) — its prose MAY name technology. That exemption is the whole reason this tree exists; it is NOT a licence to carry business content (see **Hard Prohibitions**).

> **[SCOPE]** This skill generates a **DERIVED** technical view over code + tests under `specRoots.technical.path`. It MUST NOT emit a per-module A-E engineering bundle (`A-domain-model`, `B-business-rules`, `C-api-contracts`, `D-events`, `E-user-journeys`), `M##` directories, `00-module-registry.md`, `01-domain-erd.md`, or `06-reimplementation-guide.md` — those are not part of the spec model. It MUST NOT author business content: the Feature Spec under `specRoots.business.path` owns §1–§8, and this skill neither writes nor amends it. Authority: [`docs/project-reference/spec-system-reference.md`](../../../docs/project-reference/spec-system-reference.md), [`.claude/skills/shared/sdd-artifact-contract.md`](../shared/sdd-artifact-contract.md).

**Inputs:** the code tree (command/query handlers, event consumers, background jobs, producers, sagas, outbox) and the test tree (`TestSpec` and `TechnicalSpec` annotations when present). **Code is the technical source of truth** — this skill reads it to **project** a view, never to populate a parallel *canonical* layer.

**Modes:**

| Mode       | Trigger                                    | Input                                          | Output                                                                       |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `generate` | default — refresh the derived view          | code + test annotations                         | `{TechRoot}/{Service}/{Component}.md`, all DERIVED (`references/author.md`)   |
| `audit`    | explicit request — staleness check          | code/test mtimes or git vs derived-view age     | Stale-list report (which views lag their source). Never mutates             |
| `sync`     | "sync tests" / "reconcile tests" / harvest  | canonical §8 TCs + test code                    | §8/test drift report + route-only `CoveredBy:`/orphan reconciliation (`references/sync.md`) |

**Tooling:**

- `npm run tech-spec:generate` — regenerate the derived technical views from code/test annotations.
  Equivalent direct invocation, for projects that copy `.claude/` without a `package.json`:
  `node .claude/skills/tech-spec/scripts/generate-tech-specs.mjs`

**Mode resolution (do this before any work):**

1. Parse the mode from the invocation: explicit `[mode=<x>]` arg wins; else infer ("regenerate tech specs", "technical spec for {Component}" → `generate`; "stale", "audit" → `audit`; "sync tests", "reconcile tests", "reverse sync", "harvest" → `sync`).
2. If ambiguous, present the detected mode by asking the user directly before proceeding — NEVER auto-start a mutating mode.
3. **Read the matching `references/` body** — it is the single source of truth for that mode's procedure, gates, and output contract. Do not run a mode from memory.

**Workflow:** `$scout` (locate the component) → `$tech-spec` (project the view) → `$changes-review` → `$watzup`

## The Generator Contract (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

This skill is a **generator**, not an author. Every clause below is structural — none is a preference a future maintainer may relax for convenience.

| # | Clause | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **C1** | **[BLOCKING]** Output is **DERIVED and regenerable** — every generated file carries a `> DERIVED — regenerate with the tech-spec skill; do NOT hand-edit` banner + a regenerate date. It is **NEVER a second source of truth**. | A derived view makes no truth claim, so it cannot compete for canonical status. A hand-editable tree makes one — and then "which is right, the doc or the code?" becomes askable. |
| **C2** | **[BLOCKING]** **Never authors business content.** No user story, no acceptance criterion, no business rule, no §1–§7 prose, no §8 TC is written by this skill — in any mode. The Feature Spec stays the source of truth for all of it. | Carrying the Feature Spec's own artifact types is exactly how a rival tree competes on the Feature Spec's turf. |
| **C3** | **[BLOCKING]** **Never claims to be a source of truth.** The generated files never assert canonical authority. When the view disagrees with code, **code is right by construction and the view is stale — regenerate it.** | A derived aid that asserts canonical authority corrupts the single-writer contract. |
| **C4** | **[BLOCKING]** **Write each artifact immediately** after instantiating it; do NOT accumulate large outputs in context. | A `{Service}/{Component}` fan-out is exactly the case that exhausts context mid-run and loses every unwritten artifact. |
| **C5** | **[BLOCKING]** **Single writer.** This skill is the **sole writer** under `specRoots.technical.path`. Nothing else writes there; it writes nowhere else. | Two writers is how a view becomes a sibling. |
| **C6** | **[BLOCKING]** **Regeneration is idempotent** — regenerating over unchanged source produces an **empty diff**. | This is the tree's flagship oracle: it proves the artifact can be thrown away and rebuilt from its source. If it cannot, the tree holds content of its own — it claims truth, and it is a rival. |
| **C7** | **[BLOCKING]** **A-E filenames are never emitted.** See **Hard Prohibitions**. | An A-E bundle becomes a second source of truth competing with the Feature Spec. |

### C8 — Mechanical detect + route · never judge · never write business content

> **A generator MUST NEVER apply RIT — or any judgment test — at generation time.** Judgment produces data; generators consume data.
> Canonical formulation: [`.claude/skills/shared/sdd-artifact-contract.md`](../shared/sdd-artifact-contract.md) (beside RIT). **Cited, not restated.**

| | Who | When | Output |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Judgment** (RIT, business-invariant verdicts, visibility classification) | a human, or an AI **outside** this generator | **once**, at authoring/classification time | a **persisted verdict — data** |
| **Generation** | `$tech-spec` | every run | output **mechanically re-derived** from that data |

**Idempotency holds because nothing is re-judged.** The generator reads a verdict it did not make and cannot revise. Same source + same verdicts ⇒ same output, every run. **A generator that judges is not idempotent — it fails C6 against its own tree, permanently, and the failure reports as `hand-edited`, which is the wrong cause and undiagnosable.**

**Two resolutions that are FORBIDDEN, because both look like fixes:**

| Rejected | Why it fails |
| --- | --- |
| **Scope idempotency to only the mechanical sections** | Reintroduces a **per-section carve-out** — an exemption at a new address. A carve-out is this framework's characteristic failure; do not re-mint one inside the oracle. |
| **Cache judgments inside the generator** | The generator then owns a **staleness problem**: a cached verdict that outlives the code it judged, invisible to review and to `git`. **Persisted verdicts belong in the artifact, not in generator state.** |

### C9 — The harvest detector REPORTS; it never gates

> **A structural proxy for a semantic property REPORTS; it never blocks.**
> Canonical formulation: [`.claude/skills/shared/sdd-artifact-contract.md`](../shared/sdd-artifact-contract.md) (beside RIT). **Cited, not restated.**

Harvest **detection** is a structural signal — *an invariant enforced at ≥2 points with no business rule citing it* (the countable property `references/sync.md` step 2 already asks for). It is **mechanical**, so this skill may perform it. Its output is a **candidate list** for human or `$spec [mode=update]` adjudication.

- **NEVER an `error`. NEVER a build gate. NEVER a precondition on regeneration. NEVER a fixture that fails CI.**
- The detector is a **structural proxy**: it infers a semantic property from a correlate, and the rule-citation link it reads is **prose, not a key**. It has false positives (a covered invariant can present as uncovered) **and** false negatives (an invariant enforced at one chokepoint is invisible to a ≥2-point counter).
- **Why it may not gate:** a false positive that blocks a build gets suppressed — **and a suppressed detector is a dead detector.** A `report` cannot be suppressed, because it never blocked anything worth suppressing it for.
- **A detection changes the report, never the tree** — so it cannot break C6.

**The boundary — C9 does NOT license softening anything else:**

| Rule | Operationally defined? | Severity | Why |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **C1** — DERIVED banner | **Yes** — a literal string test | **`error`** | The banner check **is** the rule |
| **C6** — regeneration-idempotency | **Yes** — regenerate, diff empty | **`error`** | **An ORACLE, not a proxy — it re-runs the transform and compares. It does not infer.** |
| **C7** — no A-E resurrection | **Yes** — a **closed** filename set | **`error`** | The filename list **is** the rule |
| **C2** — no `US-`/`AC-`/`BR-` in the technical tree | **Yes** — a static prefix denylist | **`error`** | The prefix list **is** the rule |
| **M1 / tech-token bans on the business tree** | **Yes** — a token denylist | **`error`** | Operationally defined; the spine stands |
| **Harvest detector** | **No** — measures a correlate and **infers** | **REPORT — never gates** | The proxy rule |

> **Do not misread C6 as a proxy.** C6's rule is *"regeneration over unchanged source produces an empty diff"* — **and the empty diff IS the rule.** It executes the property rather than reasoning toward it. Demoting C6 would destroy the only real oracle here. **C6 gates at `error`, and nothing stands behind it to be a proxy for.**

---

## Step 0 — Scope Gate (MANDATORY FIRST)

Before reading anything, use ask the user directly. Confirm:

| Dimension       | Question                                                                                          | Auto-Default          |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| **Scope** ★     | Which `{Service}` / `{Component}` — one component, one service, or the whole technical root?      | — must confirm        |
| **Mode** ★      | `generate` (regenerate the view) OR `audit` (staleness report) OR `sync` (reconcile §8 ↔ tests)?  | `generate`            |
| **Sections**    | Full view, or a subset (use-case inventory / TC↔test map / topology)?                             | Full view             |

> **[BLOCKING]** Resolve `specRoots.technical.path` from `docs/project-config.json` FIRST. If it is absent, STOP — the technical root is not configured and this skill has no destination. NEVER hardcode a root.
> **[BLOCKING]** If the target `{Service}`/`{Component}` has **no** derivable source (no handlers, consumers, jobs, or annotated tests), STOP — there is nothing to derive from. **NEVER fabricate a component to document.**

---

## Step 1 — Derive the Facts (grep, never recall)

Read `references/author.md` and execute its derivation greps. Extract ONLY mechanically-derivable facts:

1. **Use Case Inventory** — write ops (N), read ops (M), event-driven (K), background jobs (J), and actor roles, per `references/author.md`.
2. **TC↔test map** — the join over existing test annotations (`TestSpec` for business TC coverage, `TechnicalSpec` for technical-only coverage when present), generated from the annotations that already exist in code. **NEVER hand-move this data.**
3. **Cross-service topology** — producers, consumers, sagas, shared contracts, data ownership (the `SYNC:cross-service-check` scan below is the procedure).
4. **Anchors** — every fact carries an abstract `[Source: {namespace}/{service}/{id}]` anchor.

> **Scale note:** for a service with many components, you MAY spawn parallel reader sub-agents (one per component) that each return the extracted fields above. This is an optimization, not a gate.
> **[BLOCKING]** Do NOT interpret, rank, assess business relevance, or judge any derived fact (**C8**). Count it, anchor it, emit it.

---

## Step 2 — Instantiate the Templates

Per `references/author.md`: fixed sections, **declared order**, **pinned table sort keys**, templated prose over grepped values.

> **[BLOCKING]** **A fact that cannot be templated is emitted in a table, never narrated.** Free composition is where non-determinism lives, and it breaks **C6**.

---

## Step 3 — Stamp & Write

- Every generated file opens with the `> DERIVED — regenerate with the tech-spec skill; do NOT hand-edit` banner + a regenerate date.
- Write each file immediately after instantiating it; do NOT accumulate large outputs in context (**C4**).

---

## Step 4 — Verify (self-check before completing)

- [ ] **No retired artifacts emitted** — grep your own output paths: zero `M[0-9]` dirs, zero `A-domain-model`/`B-business-rules`/`C-api-contracts`/`D-events`/`E-user-journeys`, zero `00-module-registry`/`01-domain-erd`/`06-reimplementation-guide`.
- [ ] **DERIVED banner + regenerate date present** on each generated file.
- [ ] **No business artifact types** — zero `US-`, `AC-`, `BR-` identifiers anywhere under the technical root (**C2**).
- [ ] **No canonical claims** — the derived files never assert they are the source of truth (**C3**).
- [ ] **Every anchor resolves** — grep the source path; mark `[UNVERIFIED]` rather than guessing.
- [ ] **No secrets** — zero connection strings, credentials, tokens, internal hostnames, or customer data encountered while reading config/seeders/fixtures.
- [ ] **Idempotency** — re-running over unchanged source produces an empty diff (**C6**).

---

## Hard Prohibitions (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

This skill produces only the DERIVED technical view. Emitting an A-E engineering tree would create a second source of truth competing with the Feature Spec — and a generator still able to recreate A-E would **resurrect the retired tree on its next run**, which is an active hazard rather than a theoretical one: the tree has come back once already through a rebase and had to be re-deleted. Therefore this skill MUST NEVER create:

| Forbidden output                                                                                          | Why                                                                |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `M##` directories (e.g., `M01/`, `M02/`)                                                                  | Retired per-module partition                                       |
| `A-domain-model.md` / `B-business-rules.md` / `C-api-contracts.md` / `D-events.md` / `E-user-journeys.md` | Retired A-E engineering bundle — content lives in the Feature Spec |
| `00-module-registry.md`                                                                                   | Retired registry                                                   |
| `01-domain-erd.md`                                                                                        | Retired per-system ERD name                                        |
| `06-reimplementation-guide.md`                                                                            | Retired per-system name                                            |
| Any `US-` / `AC-` / `BR-` identifier                                                                      | Business artifact types — the Feature Spec owns them (**C2**)      |
| Any file under `specRoots.business.path`                                                                  | This skill never writes the business tree (**C5**)                 |
| A hand-edit invitation, a "maintained by" line, or any canonical claim                                    | The view is regenerable output (**C1**, **C3**)                    |

**Scope:** this prohibition governs the **emit set** under `specRoots.technical.path` — the filenames this skill may create. It does not ban writing those names in prose elsewhere (an ADR recording the retirement must be able to name them as history).

If a user explicitly asks for an A-E bundle, explain it is retired and offer the derived view instead. If a user asks this skill to write a business rule or user story, **route to `$spec`** — this skill has no authoring path.

## What Is `$tech-spec`?

A **derived-view generator** over code + tests. The canonical technical knowledge is **the code itself**, and a technical-only behavior's guard is **its test**; this skill assembles a regenerable projection (use-case inventory, TC↔test map, topology) so a component's technical surface can be read without a second hand-maintained layer. It does **not** reverse-engineer code into a parallel *canonical* bundle — that role was retired with the A-E tree, and this skill exists precisely because a projection cannot rival its own source.

> **AI Mistake Prevention** — Failure modes to avoid on every task:
>
> **Re-read files after context changes.** Context compaction, resume, or long-running work can make memory stale; verify current files before acting.
> **Verify generated content against source evidence.** AI hallucinates APIs, names, claims, and document facts. Check the relevant source before documenting or referencing.
> **Check downstream references before deleting or renaming.** Removing an artifact can stale docs, generated mirrors, configs, and callers; map references first.
> **Trace the full impact chain after edits.** Changing a definition can miss derived outputs and consumers. Follow the affected chain before declaring done.
> **Verify ALL affected outputs, not just the first.** One green check is not all green checks; validate every output surface the change can affect.
> **Assume existing values are intentional — ask WHY before changing OR flagging one as a defect.** Before changing or reporting a constant, limit, flag, cutoff, wording, or pattern, read nearby context and history, the CALLER's ordering, and 2+ sibling call sites of the same convention. A doc stating WHAT without WHY is missing rationale, not proof of a missing guard.
> **Surface ambiguity before acting — don't pick silently.** Multiple valid interpretations require an explicit question or stated assumption with risk.
> **Assert the outcome your system owns, not the intermediate state your infrastructure owns.** When verifying async work, assert the final business state — never the delivery/retry bookkeeping held in shared infrastructure that any co-running process can write. Such a check passes when run alone and flakes the moment anything else shares that infrastructure.
> **Keep shared guidance role-relevant.** Universal guidance must help every receiving skill or agent; code-specific obligations belong only in code-specific protocols.

## Prompt-Enhance Closing Anchors

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** follow declared step order for this skill; NEVER skip, reorder, or merge steps without explicit user approval
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** for every step/sub-skill call: set `in_progress` before execution, set `completed` after execution
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** every skipped step MUST include explicit reason; every completed step MUST include concise evidence
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** if Task tools unavailable, maintain an equivalent step-by-step plan tracker with synchronized statuses

<!-- PROMPT-ENHANCE:STEP-TASK-CLOSING:END -->

<!-- SYNC:parallel-subagent-dispatch -->

> **Parallel Sub-Agent Dispatch** — Plan parallelism the moment a task breakdown exists, BEFORE executing it — running provably independent tasks sequentially wastes wall-clock. Applies to every multi-step job: workflow steps, planning, batch updates, investigation, research, scans, reviews, doc sync. **Plan execution is metadata-gated, NEVER default-parallel** — fan-out follows ONLY what the plan declares (`PAR`/`SEQ` tags + per-phase write set); an untagged plan runs sequentially — why: a derived write set cannot see cascade or generated writes.
>
> 1. **Tag every task `PAR` or `SEQ`.** `PAR` = inputs exclude every pending task's output AND write set disjoint from every other `PAR`. Else `SEQ` — MUST ATTENTION name the dependency forcing it.
> 2. **Group `PAR` into waves.** No edge between members. Two writers of one file NEVER share a wave. Read-only work (search, investigation, review, research) parallelizes freely.
> 3. **Declare before dispatch:** `Parallel plan: wave 1 = [...] · wave 2 = [...] · SEQ = [...] (reason)`.
> 4. **Spawn each wave in ONE message** — every `spawn_agent` call in one response, NEVER dripped per turn. Route each task to its specialist (`.claude/skills/shared/sub-agent-selection-guide.md`); NEVER `code-reviewer` as catch-all.
> 5. **Brief each sub-agent self-contained:** goal · scope + owned files · reference docs · return contract (summary + `Full report:` path, per SYNC:subagent-return-contract) · incremental persistence to `plans/reports/` (per SYNC:incremental-persistence).
> 6. **Barrier per wave.** Advance ONLY after EVERY member returns (a skipped conditional counts as returned). Merge, mark each task completed/skipped, THEN dispatch the next wave. Mutating steps wait for the barrier.
> 7. **One level deep.** A dispatched sub-agent executes its own brief; further fan-out stays the orchestrator's job unless that agent's `.claude/agents/*.md` definition authorizes it.
>
> **NEVER parallelize:** tasks sharing a write target · a task consuming a pending task's output · trivial single-file work (dispatch overhead > gain) · an order a skill or workflow explicitly fixes · gates awaiting user approval.
>

<!-- SYNC:parallel-subagent-dispatch:reminder -->

- **MANDATORY** After planning tasks, tag each PAR/SEQ and spawn every PAR wave as parallel sub-agents in ONE message — default parallel for workflows, batch updates, investigation, research, reviews; plan execution fans out ONLY on what the plan declares.

## Closing Reminders

- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION Goal:** Project code + tests into a regenerable, single-writer technical view (use-case inventory + TC↔test map + topology) — so a component's technical surface can be read without ever forking a second, hand-maintained source of truth
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION Main steps (in order):** Step 0 Scope Gate (ask the user directly scope+mode, BLOCKING; resolve `specRoots.technical.path` FIRST) → Step 1 Derive facts (grep inventory, `TestSpec`/`TechnicalSpec` joins, topology) → Step 2 Instantiate templates (pinned order + sort keys) → Step 3 Stamp & Write (DERIVED banner + date, write each immediately) → Step 4 Verify (no retired artifacts, banner, no `US-`/`AC-`/`BR-`, no canonical claims, no secrets) — why: AI keeps forgetting the skill owns this fixed sequence; NEVER skip or reorder without user approval

**Protocols in force (concise digest of the SYNC/shared blocks this skill carries — MUST ATTENTION each canonical body above):**

- **Cross-Service Check:** scan producers/consumers/sagas/contracts; flag breaking-change risk.
- **AI Mistake Prevention:** verify generated content against evidence, trace downstream references, verify all affected outputs, re-read after context loss, surface ambiguity.
- **Critical Thinking:** NEVER present a guess as fact; traced proof, confidence >80% to act.

- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION [BLOCKING]** This skill GENERATES; it NEVER authors. No user story, acceptance criterion, business rule, or §8 TC is ever written here — route to `$spec` — why: carrying the Feature Spec's own artifact types is how a rival tree competes on its turf
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION [BLOCKING]** Output is DERIVED + regenerable — never a second source of truth; when the view disagrees with code, **code is right and the view is stale — regenerate it**
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION [BLOCKING]** Never emit `M##`/A-E/`00-module-registry`/`01-domain-erd`/`06-reimplementation-guide` under the technical root — why: an A-E bundle becomes a second source of truth, and a generator able to recreate it resurrects the retired tree on its next run
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION [BLOCKING]** Stamp the DERIVED banner + regenerate date on every generated file; write after each artifact, never accumulate large outputs in context
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION [BLOCKING]** **Never judge at generation time** (**C8**) — mechanical detect + route only; judgment is not stable across runs, so a judging generator stops being idempotent and fails **C6** against its own tree while reporting the cause as `hand-edited`
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION [BLOCKING]** The harvest detector **REPORTS, never gates** (**C9**) — never `error`, never a build gate, never a precondition on regeneration — why: a false positive that blocks a build gets suppressed, and a suppressed detector is a dead detector. **This does NOT soften C1/C2/C6/C7 or M1 — all stay at `error`; C6 is an oracle, not a proxy**
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION [BLOCKING]** Confirm scope + mode by asking the user directly BEFORE any read; no derivable source → STOP, never fabricate a component to document
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION [REQUIRED]** Read the root from `specRoots.technical.path`; `{TechRoot}/{Service}/{Component}.md` is a PATTERN — never hardcode a root, a project, a service, or a TC ID
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION [REQUIRED]** Templated prose over grepped facts ONLY — a fact that cannot be templated goes in a table, never a sentence — why: free composition is where non-determinism lives, and it breaks the idempotency oracle **and** is how a secret gets incidentally pasted
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** Cite `[Source:]` anchor evidence for every derived fact (confidence >80% to act, <60% mark `[UNVERIFIED]`) — NEVER fabricate a handler, consumer, job, or TC ID; grep to confirm
- **IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** Break task scope into small task tracking todos (one per emitted artifact) before acting; mark each `completed` immediately after its file is written; keep exactly one `in_progress`
- **Parallel Sub-Agent Dispatch:** Tag tasks PAR/SEQ, group PAR into disjoint-write-set waves, spawn each wave in ONE message, barrier before advancing.

| "I found real insight the grep missed — I'll just add a note" | That is authoring. The view holds nothing of its own. Un-greppable nuance belongs in a code comment or an ADR next to the code. |

| "The harvest detector found a real gap — make it fail the build" | NEVER. It is a proxy; a proxy that blocks gets suppressed, and a suppressed detector is dead. Report it.          |
| "The tech tree is M1-exempt, so business content is fine too" | Two orthogonal properties. `m1Policy` governs tech-agnostic strictness; it says nothing about business content. `US-`/`AC-`/`BR-` stay banned. |
| "Hand-editing this one file is faster than regenerating"      | A hand-edited derived file is a build failure. Fix the generator or the source, then regenerate.                   |
| "I'll cache the judgment so the next run is consistent"       | Generator-owned state is a staleness problem invisible to review and to `git`. Verdicts live in the artifact.      |
| "A-E would express this better for engineers"                 | A-E is retired and has resurrected once already. Emit the derived view.                                            |

**[TASK-PLANNING]** MUST ATTENTION analyze task scope and break into small todo tasks/sub-tasks via task tracking before acting.

> **[IMPORTANT]** Break into many small todo tasks systematically before starting — this is critical.

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** GENERATE, never author — output is DERIVED + regenerable; code + tests are the source of truth.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** Never judge at generation time; the harvest detector reports and never gates — but C1/C2/C6/C7 stay at `error`.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** Root from `specRoots.technical.path`; never emit A-E/`M##`/retired filenames; never write `US-`/`AC-`/`BR-`.

## Hookless Prompt Protocol Mirror (Auto-Synced)

Source: `.claude/.ck.json` + `.claude/skills/shared/sync-inline-versions.md` (`:full` blocks) + `.claude/scripts/lib/hookless-prompt-protocol.cjs`

## [WORKFLOW-EXECUTION-PROTOCOL] [BLOCKING] Workflow Execution Protocol — MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST CRITICAL. Do not skip for any reason.

**Generic portability boundary:** Reusable skills and protocol text stay project-neutral; project-specific conventions are discovered from docs/project-config.json and docs/project-reference/. Apply shared AI-SDD from `shared/sdd-artifact-contract.md`. Read `docs/project-config.json` and `docs/project-reference/docs-index-reference.md`, then open the project reference docs named there. For spec, test-case, behavior-change, public-contract, or `docs/specs/` work, route through the local spec docs named by the docs index: `feature-spec-reference.md`, `spec-system-reference.md`, `spec-principles.md`, and `workflow-spec-test-code-cycle-reference.md` when specs/tests/code must stay synchronized. If either file or a required reference doc is missing or stale, auto-run `$project-init` (or the narrow lower-level route such as `$project-config`, `$docs-init`, `$scan-all`, or `$scan --target=<key>`) before ordinary project-specific work. Any supported AI tool may execute when this shared context and local docs are available.

1. **DETECT:** If the prompt starts with an explicit slash skill/workflow command, execute it directly. Otherwise match the prompt against the workflow catalog and skill list.
2. **ANALYZE:** Choose the best option: execute directly, invoke a skill, activate a standard workflow, or compose a custom step combination.
3. **AUTO-SELECT:** Pick the best option yourself. Do not ask the user to choose between direct execution, skill, standard workflow, or custom workflow.
4. **ACTIVATE:** For a selected workflow, call `$start-workflow <workflowId>`; for a selected skill, invoke that skill; for a custom workflow, sequence custom steps directly; for direct execution, proceed with the task.
5. **CREATE TASKS:** task tracking for ALL workflow/skill/custom steps before execution when the selected path has multiple steps.
6. **PARALLELIZE:** Before executing the task list, tag each task `PAR` (independent inputs + write set disjoint from every other `PAR` task) or `SEQ` (name the blocking dependency), group `PAR` tasks into waves, declare the wave plan, and spawn each wave's sub-agents in ONE message — all-return barrier per wave, fan-out one level deep unless a sub-agent's own definition authorizes further fan-out. Sequential-by-default is a defect when tasks are independent; do not parallelize shared write targets, output-consuming tasks, trivial single-file work, ordering a skill or workflow explicitly fixes, or user-approval gates.
7. **EXECUTE:** Advance per the **Workflow Step Advancement & Parallel Phases** rule in your context instructions — model-driven; a sub-agent completion advances a step identically to an inline call; a parallel-phase group is an all-return barrier (advance only after ALL members return, never serialize it)

## SYNC:ai-sdd-artifact-contract:reminder

- **MANDATORY** Apply `shared/sdd-artifact-contract.md`; keep reusable AI-SDD in `.claude` and local rules in project docs.
- **MANDATORY** Code-to-spec extraction is reference-only until canonical acceptance; any supported AI tool may execute with synced context.
- **MANDATORY** Update `.claude` source before syncing generated mirrors; do not manually edit `.agents`, `.codex`, or `AGENTS.md`.
- **MANDATORY** Missing or stale project config, root instruction files, or required reference docs route project-specific work through `$project-init` or the narrow setup route automatically.
**[TASK-PLANNING] [MANDATORY]** BEFORE executing any workflow or skill step, create/update task tracking for all planned steps, then keep it synchronized as each step starts/completes.
## [LESSON-LEARNED-REMINDER] [BLOCKING] Task Planning & Continuous Improvement — MANDATORY. Do not skip.

Break work into small tasks (task tracking) before starting. Add final task: "Analyze AI mistakes & lessons learned".

**Extract lessons — ROOT CAUSE ONLY, not symptom fixes:**
1. Name the FAILURE MODE (reasoning/assumption failure), not symptom — "assumed API existed without reading source" not "used wrong enum value".
2. Generality test: does this failure mode apply to ≥3 contexts/codebases? If not, abstract one level up.
3. Write as a universal rule — strip project-specific names/paths/classes. Useful on any codebase.
4. Consolidate: multiple mistakes sharing one failure mode → ONE lesson.
5. **Recurrence gate:** "Would this recur in future session WITHOUT this reminder?" — No → skip `$learn`.
6. **Auto-fix gate:** "Could `$code-review`/`$code-simplifier`/`$security-review`/`$lint` catch this?" — Yes → improve review skill instead.
7. BOTH gates pass → ask user to run `$learn`.
**[CRITICAL-THINKING-MINDSET]** Apply critical thinking, sequential thinking. Every claim needs traced proof, confidence >80% to act.
**Anti-hallucination principle:** Never present guess as fact — cite sources for every claim, admit uncertainty freely, self-check output for errors, cross-reference independently, stay skeptical of own confidence — certainty without evidence root of all hallucination.
**AI Attention principle (Primacy-Recency):** Put the 3 most critical rules at both top and bottom of long prompts/protocols so instruction adherence survives long context windows.
**Goal-driven execution:** Define success criteria first, loop until verified, and stop only when observable checks pass.
**Tests verify intent:** Tests must protect business rules/invariants and fail when the protected intent breaks, not only mirror current behavior.
## Common AI Mistake Prevention (System Lessons)

- **Re-read files after context compaction.** Edit requires prior Read in same context; compaction wipes read state. Re-read before editing.
- **Grep for old terms after bulk replacements.** AI over-trusts find/replace completeness. Grep full repo after bulk edits for missed refs in docs/configs/catalogs.
- **Check downstream references before deleting.** Deletions cascade doc/code staleness. Map referencing files before removal.
- **After memory loss, check existing state before creating new.** Compaction wipes prior-work memory. Query current state to resume — never blindly duplicate.
- **Verify AI-generated content against actual code.** AI hallucinates APIs, class names, method signatures. Grep to confirm existence before documenting/referencing.
- **Trace full dependency chain after edits.** Changing a definition misses downstream consumers. Trace the full chain.
- **When renaming, grep ALL consumer file types.** Some file types silently ignore missing refs (no compile error). Search code, templates, configs, generated files.
- **Trace ALL code paths when verifying correctness.** Code existing ≠ code executing. Trace early exits, error branches, conditional skips — not just happy path.
- **Update docs that embed canonical data when source changes.** Docs inlining derived data (workflows, schemas, configs) go stale silently. Update all embedding docs alongside source.
- **Verify sub-agent results after context recovery.** Background agents may finish while parent compacted — grep-verify output, don't trust assumed completion.
- **Cross-check full target list against sub-agent assignments.** Parallel sub-agents by category miss boundary items. Reconcile union of assignments against target list before proceeding.
- **Sub-agents inherit knowledge only from their agent .md definition — use custom agent types, not built-in Explore.** Tool adoption = permission + knowledge + enforcement (numbered workflow step).
- **Persist sub-agent findings incrementally, not as a final batch.** Long sub-agents hit cutoffs before final write — findings lost. Instruct append-per-section to report file.
- **When debugging, ask "whose responsibility?" before fixing.** Trace caller (wrong data) vs callee (wrong handling). Fix at responsible layer — never patch symptom site.
- **Test failure → record a provisional verdict before trace/edit, then investigate.** Use the full five-way taxonomy: SOURCE-WRONG (production violates intent), TEST-WRONG (assertion/setup is stale), TEST-NOT-OPTIMAL (valid but fragile or low-signal test), ENVIRONMENT-BLOCKED (external state prevents a verdict), or AMBIGUOUS (intent/evidence cannot choose safely). Then trace root cause and triangulate against the governing spec (`docs/specs/**` if one exists) AND source. NEVER weaken an assertion, add a skip, relax a timeout, or change source merely to force green.
- **Grep ALL removed names after extraction/refactoring.** Primary file "done" ≠ secondary files clean. Grep entire scope for every removed symbol before declaring complete.
- **Assume existing values are intentional — ask WHY before changing OR flagging one as a defect.** Pattern-matching as "wrong" skips context. Before changing or reporting any constant/limit/flag/cutoff: read comments, git blame, the CALLER's ordering (the guarantee that makes the value correct usually lives in code running immediately BEFORE the cited line), and 2+ sibling call sites of the same convention. A doc stating WHAT without WHY is missing rationale, not proof of a missing guard — and in a validation pass, an accurate `file:line` citation proves the transcription, never the defect.
- **Verify ALL affected outputs, not just the first.** One build green ≠ all green. Multi-stack changes (backend/frontend/tests/docs) require verifying EVERY output.
- **Evaluate fit before copying a nearby pattern.** Closest example ≠ matching preconditions — verify the new context shares the same constraints, base classes, scope, lifetime.
- **Holistic-first debugging — resist nearest-attention trap.** Don't dive into first plausible cause. List EVERY precondition (config, env vars, paths, DB, endpoints, creds, versions, DI, data). Verify each against evidence (grep/query — not reasoning). Ask "what would falsify this?" — if nothing, it's not a hypothesis. Most expensive failure: going deeper in "obvious" layer while bug sits in layer never questioned.
- **Surgical changes — apply the diff test (context-aware).** Two modes: (1) Bug fix → every line traces to the bug; no restyling; orphan cleanup only for imports YOUR changes made unused. (2) Review/enhancement → implement improvements AND announce as "Enhancement beyond main request: [what]". Never silently scope-creep. Diff test: "Would this line exist if I wasn't asked to do X?" — if no, delete or announce.
- **Surface ambiguity before coding — don't pick silently.** Multiple valid interpretations → present each with effort: "[Request] could mean (1) [N h], (2) [N h]. Which matters?" List scope/format/volume/constraints assumptions first. If simpler path exists, say so. Never silently pick.
- **[MANDATORY FIRST ACTION] ALWAYS activate a suitable skill or workflow BEFORE responding.** Match task against workflow catalog + skill list; invoke via skill invocation or `$start-workflow <workflowId>`. NEVER answer or write code before checking. Skip = protocol violation.
- **Why-Review adversarial mindset — apply when reviewing any plan, decision, or design.** Default SKEPTIC not VALIDATOR: steel-man a rejected alternative, invert each stated reason ("what does it sacrifice?"), stress-test top 2-3 assumptions, run pre-mortem ("ships, fails in 3 months — what breaks?"), surface 1-2 alternatives author missed. Section presence ≠ quality; quality = causal reasoning + concrete mitigations + evidence, not "it's better" or "monitor closely".
- **Front-load report-write in sub-agent prompts for large reviews.** Many-file sub-agents hit budget before final write — findings lost. Design prompts so: (1) report-write is first explicit deliverable, (2) append per-file/section (not batched), (3) scope bounded so reads don't exhaust budget. Truncated mid-sentence with no report file → spawn narrower scope, don't retry same prompt.
- **After context compaction, re-verify all prior phase outcomes before continuing.** Summaries describe intent, not environment state (git index, filesystem, processes). On resume, FIRST audit: git status, re-read modified files, verify filesystem. Every "completed" claim is an untested hypothesis until evidence confirms.
- **OOM/memory: check row count before row size.** Triage: (1) Unbounded query — no DB filter for trigger? Push filter to DB; eliminates OOM. (2) Large rows? Projection reduces proportionally. Row reduction > projection in ROI.
- **Assert the outcome your system OWNS, never the intermediate state your INFRASTRUCTURE owns.** When testing anything asynchronous (queue/broker delivery, retries, background jobs, caches, replication), assert the final business/entity state. NEVER assert the delivery bookkeeping — consume/send status, attempt counts, last-error, row existence or counts in a broker, scheduler, or outbox/inbox table. That bookkeeping lives in shared infrastructure that ANY co-running process (a peer worker, a second replica, a leftover local container) can write, usually under a deterministic shared key, so the assertion silently tests the developer's environment instead of the system: green when run alone, flaky the instant anything else shares that broker + database. Gate question for every assertion: "would this hold no matter WHICH process did the work?" — if no, assert the converged data state instead. Corollary: process-local fault injection and in-process telemetry cannot gate work any process may perform — use them as stress amplifiers (arm → bounded window → disarm → assert convergence), never as preconditions.
- **Keep domain concepts out of generic/shared/infrastructure layers.** Reusable layer (shared library, framework, infra module) must reference NO consumer-specific domain concept — tenant/customer/product IDs, business entities, feature rules. Leak compiles + runs → passes review silently while coupling the "reusable" layer to one consumer. Keep shared type domain-free; push domain fields/logic down into the consumer via subclass/composition. — why: a layer coupled to one consumer's domain is no longer reusable.
