<!-- CODEX:PROJECT-REFERENCE-LOADING:START -->
## Codex Project-Reference Loading (No Hooks)

Codex does not receive Claude hook-based doc injection.
When coding, planning, debugging, testing, or reviewing, open project docs explicitly using this routing.

**Always read:**
- `docs/project-reference/docs-index-reference.md` (routes to the full `docs/project-reference/*` catalog)
- `docs/project-reference/lessons.md` (always-on guardrails and anti-patterns)

**Situation-based docs:**
- Backend/CQRS/API/domain/entity changes: `backend-patterns-reference.md`, `domain-entities-reference.md`, `project-structure-reference.md`
- Frontend/UI/styling/design-system: `frontend-patterns-reference.md`, `scss-styling-guide.md`, `design-system/README.md`
- Spec/test-case planning or TC mapping: `feature-docs-reference.md`
- Integration test implementation/review: `integration-test-reference.md`
- E2E test implementation/review: `e2e-test-reference.md`
- Code review/audit work: `code-review-rules.md` plus domain docs above based on changed files

Do not read all docs blindly. Start from `docs-index-reference.md`, then open only relevant files for the task.
<!-- CODEX:PROJECT-REFERENCE-LOADING:END -->

## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Create a CRO (Conversion Rate Optimization) plan for the given content or feature.

**Workflow:**

1. **Analyze** — Review current content/feature for conversion bottlenecks
2. **Research** — Identify CRO best practices and A/B test opportunities
3. **Plan** — Create actionable CRO improvement plan with measurable goals

**Key Rules:**

- PLANNING-ONLY: do not implement, only create CRO plan
- Focus on user behavior, conversion funnels, and measurable outcomes
- Always offer `$plan-review` after plan creation

**Be skeptical. Apply critical thinking, sequential thinking. Every claim needs traced proof, confidence percentages (Idea should be more than 80%).**

## PLANNING-ONLY — Collaboration Required

> **DO NOT** use the manual plan-mode switching tool — you are ALREADY in a planning workflow.
> **DO NOT** implement or execute any code changes.
> **COLLABORATE** with the user: ask decision questions, present options with recommendations.
> After plan creation, ALWAYS run `$plan-review` to validate the plan.
> ASK user to confirm the plan before any next step.

You are an expert in conversion optimization. Analyze the content based on the given issues:
<issues>$ARGUMENTS</issues>

Activate `planning` skill.

**IMPORTANT:** Analyze the skills catalog and activate the skills that are needed for the task during the process.
**IMPORTANT:** Sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision when writing outputs.

## Conversion Optimization Framework

1. Headline 4-U Formula: **Useful, Unique, Urgent, Ultra-specific** (80% won't read past this)
2. Above-Fold Value Proposition: Customer problem focus, no company story, zero scroll required
3. CTA First-Person Psychology: "Get MY Guide" vs "Get YOUR Guide" (90% more clicks)
4. 5-Field Form Maximum: Every field kills conversions, progressive profiling for the rest
5. Message Match Precision: Ad copy, landing page headline, broken promises = bounce
6. Social Proof Near CTAs: Testimonials with faces/names, results, placed at decision points
7. Cognitive Bias Stack: Loss aversion (fear), social proof (FOMO), anchoring (pricing)
8. PAS Copy Framework: Problem > Agitate > Solve, emotion before logic
9. Genuine Urgency Only: Real deadlines, actual limits, fake timers destroy trust forever
10. Price Anchoring Display: Show expensive option first, make real price feel like relief
11. Trust Signal Clustering: Security badges, guarantees, policies all visible together
12. Visual Hierarchy F-Pattern: Eyes scan F-shape, put conversions in the path
13. Lead Magnet Hierarchy: Templates > Checklists > Guides (instant > delayed gratification)
14. Objection Preemption: Address top 3 concerns before they think them, FAQ near CTA
15. Mobile Thumb Zone: CTAs where thumbs naturally rest, not stretching required
16. One-Variable Testing: Change one thing, measure impact, compound wins over time
17. Post-Conversion Momentum: Thank you page sells next step while excitement peaks
18. Cart Recovery Sequence: Email in 1 hour, retarget in 4 hours, incentive at 24 hours
19. Reading Level Grade 6: Smart people prefer simple, 11-word sentences, short paragraphs
20. TOFU/MOFU/BOFU Logic: Awareness content ≠ decision content, match intent precisely
21. White Space = Focus: Empty space makes CTAs impossible to miss, crowded = confused
22. Benefit-First Language: Features tell, benefits sell, transformations compel
23. Micro-Commitment Ladder: Small yes leads to big yes, start with email only
24. Performance Tracking Stack: Heatmaps show problems, recordings show why, events show what
25. Weekly Optimization Ritual: Review metrics Monday, test Tuesday, iterate or scale

## Workflow

- If the user provides a screenshots or videos, use `ai-multimodal` skill to describe as detailed as possible the issue, make sure the CRO analyst can fully understand the issue easily based on the description.
- If the user provides a URL, use `web_fetch` tool to fetch the content of the URL and analyze the current issues.
- You can use screenshot capture tools along with `ai-multimodal` skill to capture screenshots of the exact parent container and analyze the current issues with the appropriate Gemini analysis skills (`ai-multimodal`, `gemini-video-understanding`, or `gemini-document-processing`).
- Use `$scout-ext` (preferred) or `$scout` (fallback) slash command to search the codebase for files needed to complete the task
- Use `planner` agent to create a comprehensive CRO plan following the progressive disclosure structure: - Create a directory using naming pattern from `## Naming` section. - Every `plan.md` MUST ATTENTION start with YAML frontmatter:

            ```yaml
            ---
            title: '{Brief title}'
            description: '{One sentence for card preview}'
            status: pending
            priority: P2
            effort: { sum of phases, e.g., 4h }
            branch: { current git branch }
            tags: [cro, conversion]
            created: { YYYY-MM-DD }
            ---
            ```

        - Save the overview access point at `plan.md`, keep it generic, under 80 lines, and list each phase with status/progress and links.
        - For each phase, add `phase-XX-phase-name.md` files containing sections (Context links, Overview with date/priority/statuses, Key Insights, Requirements, Architecture, Related code files, Implementation Steps, Todo list, Success Criteria, Risk Assessment, Security Considerations, Next steps).
        - Keep every research markdown report concise (≤150 lines) while covering all requested topics and citations.

    **IMPORTANT:** Sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision when writing reports.
    **IMPORTANT:** In reports, list any unresolved questions at the end, if any.

## **IMPORTANT Task Planning Notes (MUST ATTENTION FOLLOW)**

- Always plan and break work into many small todo tasks using task tracking
- Always add a final review todo task to verify work quality and identify fixes/enhancements
- **MANDATORY FINAL TASKS:** After creating all planning todo tasks, ALWAYS add these three final tasks:
    1. **Task: "Write test specifications for each phase"** — Add `## Test Specifications` with TC-{FEAT}-{NNN} IDs to every phase file. Use `$tdd-spec` if feature docs exist. Use `Evidence: TBD` for TDD-first mode.
    2. **Task: "Run $plan-validate"** — Trigger `$plan-validate` skill to interview the user with critical questions and validate plan assumptions
    3. **Task: "Run $plan-review"** — Trigger `$plan-review` skill to auto-review plan for validity, correctness, and best practices

## REMINDER — Planning-Only Command

> **DO NOT** use manual plan-mode switching tool.
> **DO NOT** start implementing.
> **ALWAYS** validate with `$plan-review` after plan creation.
> **ASK** user to confirm the plan before any implementation begins.
> **ASK** user decision questions with your recommendations when multiple approaches exist.

> **AI Mistake Prevention** — Failure modes to avoid on every task:
>
> **Check downstream references before deleting.** Deleting components causes documentation and code staleness cascades. Map all referencing files before removal.
> **Verify AI-generated content against actual code.** AI hallucinates APIs, class names, and method signatures. Always grep to confirm existence before documenting or referencing.
> **Trace full dependency chain after edits.** Changing a definition misses downstream variables and consumers derived from it. Always trace the full chain.
> **Trace ALL code paths when verifying correctness.** Confirming code exists is not confirming it executes. Always trace early exits, error branches, and conditional skips — not just happy path.
> **When debugging, ask "whose responsibility?" before fixing.** Trace whether bug is in caller (wrong data) or callee (wrong handling). Fix at responsible layer — never patch symptom site.
> **Assume existing values are intentional — ask WHY before changing.** Before changing any constant, limit, flag, or pattern: read comments, check git blame, examine surrounding code.
> **Verify ALL affected outputs, not just the first.** Changes touching multiple stacks require verifying EVERY output. One green check is not all green checks.
> **Holistic-first debugging — resist nearest-attention trap.** When investigating any failure, list EVERY precondition first (config, env vars, DB names, endpoints, DI registrations, data preconditions), then verify each against evidence before forming any code-layer hypothesis.
> **Surgical changes — apply the diff test.** Bug fix: every changed line must trace directly to the bug. Don't restyle or improve adjacent code. Enhancement task: implement improvements AND announce them explicitly.
> **Surface ambiguity before coding — don't pick silently.** If request has multiple interpretations, present each with effort estimate and ask. Never assume all-records, file-based, or more complex path.

## Learned Lessons

# Lessons

<!-- This file is referenced by Claude skills and agents for project-specific context. -->
<!-- Fill in your project's details below. -->

- [2026-03-10] **Mirror copies create staleness traps.** Editing a canonical source is insufficient when mirror copies exist — must trace and update ALL mirrored files (configs, skill definitions, docs). Grep verification after edits catches missed mirrors.
- [2026-03-10] **Docs embedding derived data stale on source modification.** Documentation that inlines data from a canonical source (e.g., workflow sequences, API schemas) goes stale silently when the source changes. Map all docs that embed canonical data and update them alongside the source.
- [2026-04-14] **Front-load report-write in sub-agent prompts for large reviews.** Sub-agents reviewing many files exhaust token budget before writing the final report — all findings lost. Design prompts so: (1) report-write is the explicit first deliverable, (2) findings appended per-file immediately (not batched), (3) scope is bounded. If sub-agent returns truncated output with no report, spawn a new one with narrower scope.
- [2026-04-14] **After context compaction, re-verify all prior phase outcomes before continuing.** Session summaries describe what the AI intended — not what persisted in the environment. When resuming a multi-phase task, the first action must be a state audit: re-check git status, re-read files, verify filesystem state. Treat every "completed" phase claim as an untested hypothesis.
## [LESSON-LEARNED-REMINDER] [BLOCKING] Task Planning & Continuous Improvement — MANDATORY. Do not skip.

Break work into small tasks (task tracking) before starting. Add final task: "Analyze AI mistakes & lessons learned".

**Extract lessons — ROOT CAUSE ONLY, not symptom fixes:**
1. Name the FAILURE MODE (reasoning/assumption failure), not symptom — "assumed API existed without reading source" not "used wrong enum value".
2. Generality test: does this failure mode apply to ≥3 contexts/codebases? If not, abstract one level up.
3. Write as a universal rule — strip project-specific names/paths/classes. Useful on any codebase.
4. Consolidate: multiple mistakes sharing one failure mode → ONE lesson.
5. **Recurrence gate:** "Would this recur in future session WITHOUT this reminder?" — No → skip `$learn`.
6. **Auto-fix gate:** "Could `$code-review`/`/simplify`/`$security`/`$lint` catch this?" — Yes → improve review skill instead.
7. BOTH gates pass → ask user to run `$learn`.
**[TASK-PLANNING] [MANDATORY]** BEFORE executing any workflow or skill step, create/update task tracking for all planned steps, then keep it synchronized as each step starts/completes.
