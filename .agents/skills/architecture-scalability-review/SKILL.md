## Codex Project-Reference Loading (Hook-Independent)

Claude and Codex use static project-reference loading as the authority; hooks may accelerate discovery but never replace the explicit read.
When coding, planning, debugging, testing, or reviewing, open project docs explicitly using this routing.

**Always read:**
- `docs/project-config.json` (project-specific paths, commands, modules, and workflow/test settings)
- `docs/project-reference/docs-index-reference.md` (routes to the full `docs/project-reference/*` catalog)
- `docs/project-reference/lessons.md` (always-on guardrails and anti-patterns)

**Missing/stale context route:** If `docs/project-config.json`, the docs index, `lessons.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, or any task-required reference doc is missing or stale, auto-run `$project-init` or the narrow setup route (`$project-config`, `$docs-init`, `$scan-all`, `$scan --target=<key>`, `$ai-context-refresh`) before ordinary project-specific work. A full `$sync-codex` run preflights `CLAUDE.md`; a completed `$ai-context-refresh` run may invoke the standalone runner with `--skip=claude-md` after final source edits. Markerless roots need AI smart-merge unless `portability.requireUniversalGuides: false` is explicit.

**Situation-based docs** (pick by the phase you are about to enter — plan/investigate, edit, test, spec/doc, review — and read only docs the project selects in `referenceDocs` that exist):
- Planning, investigation, or design: `project-structure-reference.md`, `domain-entities-reference.md`, plus the docs below for every file type the plan touches
- Editing or writing code: `code-review-rules.md` plus the backend or frontend docs below for the file type
- Project structure/architecture/tech-stack/deployment/setup (any layer — backend, frontend, or infra): `project-structure-reference.md`
- Backend/CQRS/API/domain/entity changes: `backend-patterns-reference.md`, `domain-entities-reference.md`
- Frontend/UI/styling/design-system: `frontend-patterns-reference.md`, `scss-styling-guide.md` (or the configured styling reference), `design-system/README.md`
- Spec authoring, `docs/specs/` pathing, or TC format: `feature-spec-reference.md`, `spec-system-reference.md`, `spec-principles.md`
- Behavior/public-contract changes or spec-test-code sync: `workflow-spec-test-code-cycle-reference.md` plus the spec docs above
- Derived spec indexes/ERDs/reimplementation guides: `spec-system-reference.md` and source Feature Specs under `docs/specs/`
- Integration test implementation/review: `integration-test-reference.md`
- E2E test implementation/review: `e2e-test-reference.md`
- Test-data seeders: `seed-test-data-reference.md`
- Code review/audit work: `code-review-rules.md` plus the docs above for every file type under review
- Per-file conventions (`contextGroups[]`): before editing an unfamiliar path class, run `node .claude/hooks/lib/file-conventions.cjs --lookup <path>`

**Dedup:** a doc counts as loaded only when your own read returned its full content to this context after the last compaction and within roughly the last 200K tokens, and it has not changed since — cite it `(loaded)` instead of re-reading. A hook reminder, a summary, or a prior mention never counts; a delegated sub-agent starts empty, so name the resolved doc paths in its brief.

Never read all docs blindly: route from `docs-index-reference.md` and open only what the task needs.

## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Grade a project or planned architecture against architecture + scalability criteria and produce an evidence-backed `/20` verdict (`STRONG` / `NEEDS WORK` / `HIGH RISK`) before scale or delivery decisions harden; route deep checks to owner skills.

**Summary:**
- **Purpose/ownership:** score 10 areas, apply G1-G7 and TVC, route sibling-owned depth, and emit one report; this skill owns the scorecard, not sibling checklists.
- **Ordered run:** (1) resolve `mode=init`/`mode=audit` + scope; (2) load context/evidence; (3) read `references/scorecard.md`; (4) score all 10 areas 0-2; (5) run G1-G7, then TVC; (6) emit the report under `tmp/reports/`; (7) validate sub-80/risk findings with `$why-review` (max 2 passes), or record the zero-risk skip.
- **Evidence/TVC:** every score needs `file:line`, command/artifact proof, or `N/A - reason`; otherwise score `0`. Resolve Unit/Integration/System/E2E applicability plus owner/root/data, full+focused commands, zero-match behavior, CI/simple Windows/macOS/Linux entry, unique run/data identity, and repeat proof; unresolved applicable fields block handoff.
- **Modes/advisories:** `init` scores planned greenfield evidence; `audit` scores existing evidence. Self-audit 11 red flags before emission; treat `— VERIFY` rows/section banners as unverified and confirm named sources or project docs. Technique + Scenario are advice-only and never change `/20`, verdict, or gates; new tools require user confirmation.

**Workflow (run in order):**

1. Resolve `mode=init` or `mode=audit` + target scope.
2. Load project context and evidence.
3. Read `references/scorecard.md`.
4. Score all 10 areas 0-2 with evidence.
5. Run pass/fail gates (G1-G7), then the non-scoring TVC.
6. Emit the architecture scalability review report under `tmp/reports/`.
7. When triggered, validate sub-80 grades/risk findings with `$why-review` (maximum 2 passes); otherwise record the zero-risk skip.

**Key Rules:**

- MUST ATTENTION every score carries `file:line`, command output, architecture-artifact evidence, or explicit `N/A - reason`; unproven criteria score `0`.
- MUST ATTENTION this skill owns the scorecard, not the deep review of every concern — route depth to the sibling skills named in the Ownership Matrix; NEVER duplicate their checklists.
- New Tech/Lib: `N/A` by default. If the audit recommends Nx, Turborepo, Bazel, a new message broker, a new observability stack, or another tool, present it for user confirmation before implementation.
- `mode=init` scores planned architecture from greenfield artifacts before implementation planning; `mode=audit` scores an existing brownfield project from real source, config, CI, docs, and ADR evidence.

## When To Use

- Greenfield/project-init flow after `architecture-design`, before implementation planning hardens decisions.
- On demand for project quality, architecture scalability, distributed-monolith risk, module boundaries, build scalability, or setup quality.
- Periodic architecture health check for a growing codebase.

NEVER use this as the every-change diff reviewer. Per-change regression checks belong in `architecture-review`, `performance-review`, `production-readiness-review`, and other sibling reviewers already wired into `workflow-review-changes`.

> **Combined audit:** For a whole-project architecture + compliance + production-readiness audit, run `$architecture-review-full` (or `$start-workflow workflow-architecture-audit`); it fans out this skill, `architecture-review`, and `production-readiness-review` as parallel sub-agents and synthesizes one report.

## Scope And Modes

### `mode=init`

Score intended architecture before implementation. Evidence may include architecture reports, ADRs, tech-stack decisions, domain-analysis outputs, build/CI plans, deployment plans, and scaffold handoff tables.
Use `planned` labels when implementation is absent. Score `2` only when the plan names enforceable mechanisms, not intent alone.
### `mode=audit`

Score an existing repository. Evidence must come from source, build/CI config, ADRs, reference docs, tests, dependency-boundary tooling, deployment/IaC files, and graph/grep commands.
If `.code-graph/graph.db` exists, run at least one graph command on key architecture files before concluding.

## Required Context

Read these before scoring:

- `docs/project-config.json`
- Under the reference-docs root (default `docs/project-reference`; a `docsRoots.projectReference.path` entry in `docs/project-config.json` overrides the path): `docs-index-reference.md`, `lessons.md`, `project-structure-reference.md`
- Relevant stack docs from the docs index, based on target scope
- Accepted ADRs under the ADR root (default `docs/adr/**`; a `docsRoots.adr.path` entry in `docs/project-config.json` overrides the path), when present
- Existing architecture, domain, CI, deployment, and observability artifacts in the target plan or repo

## Ownership Matrix

| Area | Cadence | This skill owns | Route depth to |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Build & CI Scalability | init / audit | Score incremental builds, affected-only detection, cache strategy, parallel test/build strategy, monorepo quality gate posture | `linter-setup` for quality gates; `scaffold` for project foundation |
| Architecture Pattern / distributed-monolith | init / audit + every-change smell | Score modular monolith vs microservices fit and distributed-monolith risk | `architecture-design` for design choices; `architecture-review` for diff-level boundary drift |
| Module Isolation | init / audit + every-change boundary drift | Score bounded-context isolation and independent build/test/deploy expectations | `domain-analysis`, `architecture-review` |
| Dependency Discipline | init / audit + every-change | Score explicit dependency directions and enforcement mechanisms | `architecture-review`, `linter-setup` |
| Loose Coupling | init / audit + every-change | Score event-driven ownership and absence of avoidable sync coupling | `domain-analysis`, `architecture-review` |
| Horizontal Scaling | init / audit + local hot-path review | Score system-level statelessness, load balancing, caching, async, partitioning, autoscaling, SPOF, latency/throughput limits | `performance-review`, `production-readiness-review` |
| DRY | init / audit + every-change duplication drift | Score strategic shared-platform, monorepo/shared-lib, and duplicated-knowledge posture | `architecture-review`, `scaffold` |
| Abstraction / Easy-to-Change | init / audit + every-change conformance | Score swappable technical concerns, stable contracts, and interface boundaries where they reduce future change cost | `architecture-design`, `architecture-review`, `scaffold` |
| Clean Architecture | init / audit + every-change | Score dependency-rule fit, business logic placement, and architecture style enforcement | `architecture-review`, `scaffold` |
| Observability & Delivery | init / audit + production readiness | Score monitoring, logging, metrics, DevOps/deployment, CI/CD, IaC, rollback posture | `production-readiness-review`, `linter-setup` |

When a concern belongs to a sibling, record a one-line route pointer and continue scoring from evidence; NEVER expand into the sibling's checklist.

## Workflow

Run in order; scorecard validation follows report emission when its trigger applies.

### Step 1: Resolve Mode And Scope

Determine mode (`mode=init` or `mode=audit`), target (repo, plan directory, service/module, or artifact set), evidence roots (source, CI/build, ADRs, reference docs, workflow outputs), and report slug (project/module name).
If mode is missing, infer from context:
- Greenfield/project-init/plan artifacts only -> `mode=init`
- Existing repo/source/config review -> `mode=audit`

### Step 2: Gather Evidence

Use narrow grep/glob searches first. For brownfield audits, collect:

- Build files and CI pipeline config
- Workspace/monorepo config, if present
- Dependency-boundary or architecture-rule tooling
- Module/service folder structure
- Message bus, event, API, and cross-context communication patterns
- Deployment, IaC, observability, and runtime config
- ADRs and architecture reports

When `.code-graph/graph.db` exists, run a graph trace on key architecture/module-boundary files. If relevant files are absent, record the limitation and continue with grep/file evidence.

### Step 3: Score The 10 Areas

Read `references/scorecard.md`, then score each area:

- `0` = absent, contradicted, or unproven
- `1` = partially addressed, documented but weakly enforced, or implemented in only some areas
- `2` = designed and enforced with evidence

Total score: `/20`.

| Total | Verdict | Meaning |
| ---: | --- | --- |
| 17-20 | STRONG | Architecture/scalability posture is credible; address any non-blocking gaps. |
| 11-16 | NEEDS WORK | Material gaps exist; plan follow-up before growth or high-scale use. |
| 0-10 | HIGH RISK | Architecture/setup quality is not yet safe for scale; fix gates before major delivery. |

#### Technique Applicability (advisory — NON-SCORING)

After scoring, invoke `SYNC:scale-technique-gate`: derive the scale tier from users/RPS, SLO, data volume, tenancy, and topology with `file:line`/config/infra evidence + confidence; emit the **Technique Applicability Matrix** (`technique | tier-warranted? | present? | verdict | advice | evidence`) for all 10 concern groups; advise on warranted gaps and flag unwarranted `OVER-ENGINEERED` techniques.

> **Advisory only — does NOT change the `/20` score or any verdict band.** A `MISSING-WARRANTED` technique is guidance, never a deduction; a correctly-lean small system stays a PASS. Full catalog → `.claude/docs/scale-technique-catalog.md`.

### Step 4: Run Pass/Fail Gates

Run these pass/fail overlays after scoring; they do not change `/20` math.

| Gate | Blocks STRONG when failing | Check |
| --- | --- | --- |
| G1 Evidence Integrity | yes | Any `2` score without evidence is downgraded; repeated unproven claims fail the gate. |
| G2 Build & CI Scalability | yes for init/audit scope with multi-module growth | Incremental/affected-only/caching strategy exists or a clear N/A rationale is documented. |
| G3 Distributed-Monolith Risk | yes | Chosen architecture avoids service/module split with shared DB, circular sync calls, or deploy-together-only coupling disguised as distribution. |
| G4 Boundary Enforcement | yes | Dependency direction and module boundaries are explicit and enforceable. |
| G5 Horizontal Scaling Bottlenecks | yes for high-scale target | Statelessness, bottlenecks, SPOF, resource ceilings, and async/back-pressure posture are known and owned. **Also required: a named ESCAPE HATCH out of a metastable high-load state** (shed at the edge / drain-or-truncate the queue / warm the cache / restart at lower concurrency) — retry storms, cold caches and queue backlog form a self-sustaining loop that OUTLIVES its trigger, so removing load does not recover the system. **And latency evidence with no stated load-generation method cannot support a Pass — grade G5 `Partial` at best and ask for the method** (per `references/scorecard.md:38`; do NOT discard the figure as missing evidence) — because a harness that waits for slow responses deletes the worst samples (coordinated omission), so its p99 is a lie. |
| G6 Reuse Without Coupling | no | Shared libraries/platform code reduce duplicated knowledge without leaking consumer domain concepts. |
| G7 Secrets And Sensitive Output | yes | Audit report redacts credentials and does not expose secrets found during inspection. |

Critical/high gate failures require an owner-accepted risk or follow-up plan before reporting STRONG.

### Testability & Verification Contract (TVC — non-scoring gate)

Run this cross-cutting setup gate after G1-G7 and before report emission. Consume architecture-design plus scaffold/harness evidence; do not re-implement tier-specific child checklists.

1. Verify one row each for Unit, Integration/System, and E2E. Each row is `APPLICABLE` only with runner/framework/configuration/root evidence, or `N/A — {specific evidence}`. An E2E `N/A` must cite the verified absence of a browser runner/configuration/command, never the absence of a preferred tool.
2. For every applicable row, verify copy-ready full and focused commands, invalid/zero-match non-zero behavior, CI gate, simple Windows/macOS/Linux entry point where needed, owner, and exact result fields.
3. Verify the declared run identity and business-data suffix, supported public setup path, realistic valid data, idempotent/restart-safe reference setup, additive persistent-data policy, mutable-root/parallel-worker isolation, pacing/arrange barrier, and two consecutive no-reset full runs for each applicable persistent-state suite. Missing or placeholder evidence is `BLOCKED`, not a guessed pass.
4. Emit `TVC: PASS | PARTIAL | BLOCKED` with the matrix, evidence, owner, and follow-up. `PASS` means every tier is resolved and every applicable field is evidenced; `PARTIAL` records the bounded gap without inventing a tier or command.

TVC is setup/verification status, not an eighth score area. It MUST NOT change any 0-2 grade, `/20` denominator or total, verdict band, G1-G7 status, or advisory matrix. `BLOCKED` prevents a `setup complete` claim and remains a report follow-up, not a score deduction.

### Step 5: Emit Report

Write `tmp/reports/architecture-scalability-review-{YYMMDD}-{HHmm}-{slug}.md`.

Report structure:

## Scorecard Validation Gate (why-review; required for any sub-80 grade or risk finding)

> **Purpose:** A scorecard is a JUDGMENT. Validate it adversarially before handoff so a mis-scored area or inflated risk finding does not become ground truth. This gate validates findings only; fixes route to the owning sibling and this skill does not self-converge a fix-loop.

**Trigger:** Any area below 80 or any risk/gap finding. Skip ONLY when every area is ≥80 with zero risk findings.

**Protocol:**

1. Read the finalized report from `tmp/reports/{skill}-{date}-{slug}.md` (or the exact path written).
2. Invoke `$why-review --validate-findings <report-path>`; verify every sub-80 grade/risk finding has `file:line` evidence and clears the finding-survival bar.
3. **If why-review demotes/removes a grade or finding:** update the scorecard, add `## Why-Review Validation Notes`, and cite what changed + why.
4. **If validation changes the scorecard:** re-run this gate, maximum 2 passes, until remaining grades/findings are validated. No fix-loop: route fixes to siblings; do not restart this review over its own fixes.

**Anti-bias (MANDATORY before emitting):** steel-man each grade one band better and one band worse; only a grade surviving both arguments ships. An unchallenged grade is not validated.

> **Architecture self-audit (§20.3):** Reject tool-first choices, unevidenced scale, unnamed sacrifices/forces, unjustified layers/splits, mishandled reversibility/consistency, unknown first load break, and decisions the maintainer cannot explain.
>
> **MUST ATTENTION READ** `.claude/docs/architecture-knowledge.md` §20.3 before applying this audit.

**Self-audit against the thinking red flags (MANDATORY before emitting):** run the 11 red flags in `.claude/docs/architecture-knowledge.md` §20.3 against every grade, gap and recommendation. The four that fire most often in a scorecard: **grading down for a scale you cannot evidence** · **recommending a tool before stating the requirement** · **"best practice" with no named forces** · **cannot say what your recommendation SACRIFICES**. Any hit invalidates the GRADE's reasoning — re-derive it from evidence or drop the finding; NEVER just reword it. — why: an unevidenced deduction reads as rigour and sends the team to fix a problem they do not have.

## Completion Criteria

- All 10 areas are scored.
- Every score has evidence or explicit `N/A - reason`.
- All gates have `pass`, `partial`, `fail`, or `N/A - reason`.
- Cadence matrix maps each area to init/on-demand and every-change homes.
- Sibling deep checks are routed, not duplicated.
- TVC has a resolved Unit/Integration/System/E2E matrix with evidence-backed applicability or N/A, commands, owners, data/run policy, and repeat proof.
- TVC remains non-scoring and does not alter the `/20` score, verdict band, G1-G7, or advisory semantics.

- **MANDATORY MUST ATTENTION ALWAYS ASK THE 3 TRADE-OFF QUESTIONS** — on the thing under review AND on every recommendation you make: (1) **what does it SACRIFICE?** name the dimensions checked (change cost · complexity · perf · coupling · reversibility · migration · ops load · blast radius · security · testability · delivery time · UX) — "none"/"pure win" is an unfinished analysis; (2) **is it worth it?** gain (with a metric) vs cost, WHO pays, WHEN → emit **WORTH IT / NOT WORTH IT / UNCLEAR**; NOT WORTH IT → withdraw or replace it; (3) **is it MATERIAL enough to confirm with the user?** irreversible/one-way door · cost shifted onto another team/ops/maintainer/user · one quality attribute traded for another · a tier/service/event/library boundary crossed · auth/money/data-integrity/breaking-change/High-or-Medium-risk path · verdict UNCLEAR → **STOP and confirm by asking the user directly BEFORE the verdict**.
- **MANDATORY** A MATERIAL trade-off with no user confirmation can NEVER be PASS; never bury one as a Low-severity note, never decide it silently, and never let delivery or convergence pressure authorize a one-way door — an un-walked-back one-way door is the user's call, not the reviewer's.
- **MANDATORY — a context that cannot ask escalates BY HANDOFF, never by silence.** ask the user directly reaches only the main interactive agent, so a sub-agent or a terminal/verdict-only mode cannot ask. There the duty is REDIRECTED, not waived: still name the trade-off, still decide materiality, record `confirmed? = NO — cannot ask from this context`, and **state the unconfirmed MATERIAL trade-off in your RETURNED verdict so the CALLER escalates it** (a note only in an on-disk report is not a handoff); never emit an unqualified PASS.

<!-- SYNC:project-protocol-overlay:reminder -->

**MUST ATTENTION** resolve this skill's overlays from the index at `<docsRoots.projectReference.path>/skill-protocols-reference.md` (default `docs/project-reference/`; overridable in `docs/project-config.json`); an empty task `referenceDocs` does NOT disable this lookup. Read ONLY matched bodies from the directory the index header names (default `docs/project-protocols/`). Specificity (exact > glob > `*`) ranks overlays against EACH OTHER, never against the skill. Missing/malformed body → report and skip; no index or no match → proceed silently. Overlays are ADDITIVE ONLY — never an authority escalation or a gate waiver; equal-tier contradiction goes to the user.

<!-- /SYNC:project-protocol-overlay:reminder -->

<!-- SYNC:test-architecture-execution-contract:reminder -->

**MUST ATTENTION** Each assertion-bearing test names the behavior or technical contract it protects and asserts an outcome it owns. Use the project's configured/native test format — Given/When/Then is one valid format, never a framework-wide requirement. When `specArtifacts` is valid, link configured owner/case/variant identity and `intent/contracts` evidence; when absent, name the guarded business intent or technical contract. A malformed declared profile BLOCKS without fallback. Broad test-format migration → assign an owner and next step, never rewrite cases outside scope.

**MUST ATTENTION** Before implementation record evidence-backed applicability for the test types and modes the task/project contract requires: copy-ready full and focused commands where available, zero-match behavior, a useful platform-appropriate entry point, supported execution modes and environments, state-isolation requirements, exact results, and repeat evidence where persistent state makes it relevant. Exercise claimed modes; report a missing required capability as `ENVIRONMENT-BLOCKED`. Never invent production targets or impose a test format. Browser/UI E2E uses the configured runner's waits or project helper for observable readiness and outcomes; apply action pacing only where the project contract specifies it. Reuse the project's evidenced test organization — require a POM, base class, or component taxonomy only when the project actually selects it.

<!-- SYNC:severity-rubric:reminder -->

- **MANDATORY** Classify every finding Critical/High/Medium/Low by consequence using the affected asset, shipped impact, exposure, reversibility, evidence location, and confidence; Critical/High/MEDIUM remain actionable under the round bar, while LOW is recorded/deferred from round 2 onward.
- **MANDATORY** Keep binary gates separate from severity: a failed test, security must-fix, required artifact, or parity check blocks at every round and is never relabeled LOW.
- **MANDATORY** Score-based skills (sre 0-2, perf two-axis) map onto the same four tiers — no parallel severity vocabulary.

<!-- /SYNC:severity-rubric:reminder -->

<!-- SYNC:engineering-foundation-gate:reminder -->

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** engineering-foundation gate — judges whether the team can build, run, test, and change the system repeatably as it grows. Derive lifecycle, scale, criticality, repository shape, and runtime from evidence; take the lower supported tier when unknown. Judge all 7 dimensions, using `N/A-by-profile` with evidence when a concern truly does not apply. **F1** reproducible build/run/test path · **F2** document and exercise each supported or required execution mode; dual host/container or other modes only when the project uses or needs them · **F3** environment portability at applicable local/CI/production-shaped targets · **F4** meaningful test-strength evidence without making one mutation tool universal · **F5** measured performance where scale/risk warrants it · **F6** change/build scalability where the repository has meaningful module boundaries · **F7** mechanical checks selected for the stack/profile. For each, judge outcomes rather than tools, and preserve anti-over-engineering. Foundation creation may block on missing warranted outcomes; brownfield audits advise and name the smallest next step. Catalog → `.claude/docs/engineering-foundation-catalog.md` (update first, then re-run `inject_engineering_foundation_gate.py`).

<!-- /SYNC:engineering-foundation-gate:reminder -->

<!-- SYNC:review-principle-awareness:reminder -->

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** Every review first checks the change context and routes only applicable principles to their detailed protocols: scale-ready foundation, test intent in the project's native format (GWT is one option), AI-agent-as-user access, and UI/component design when relevant. Record evidence-backed apply/adapt/defer/N/A/block/unverified status with owner and next step; do not invent unrelated findings or expand scope.

<!-- /SYNC:review-principle-awareness:reminder -->

<!-- SYNC:project-reference-docs-guide:reminder -->

- **MANDATORY** Project config is OPTIONAL (default `docs/project-config.json`, via its loader): absent → portable defaults plus repository evidence, state material assumptions, never block; present → non-empty `project.name`, neutral defaults for omitted capabilities, fail closed on a declared malformed section.
- **MANDATORY** An explicit `referenceDocs` array is exact, including `[]`; absent → only the capability-aware resolver output, which may be empty. `lessons.md` and docs-index are always-on, outside that selection. A missing/stale required input or malformed declared section → `$project-init` or the narrow owner route before relying on it.
- **MANDATORY** Pick docs by the phase you are about to enter — plan/investigate, edit code, tests, specs/docs, review — from the gate's routing table, JUST IN TIME before the first target read/grep/edit/test, plus the file's `contextGroups[]` conventions before editing it; cite `Reference docs read: ...`.
- **MANDATORY** Dedup: skip a re-read only for your own full read after the last compaction, within ~200K tokens, unchanged since — a hook reminder, summary, or prior mention is NEVER evidence; re-read after compaction or resume, and give delegated sub-agents the resolved doc paths. Project config and conventions override generic framework defaults.

## Closing Reminders

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION Goal:** Grade a project or planned architecture against architecture + scalability criteria and produce an evidence-backed `/20` verdict (`STRONG` / `NEEDS WORK` / `HIGH RISK`) before scale or delivery decisions harden; route deep checks to owner skills.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION scorecard scope:** assess all 10 areas — Build & CI Scalability, Architecture Pattern/distributed-monolith, Module Isolation, Dependency Discipline, Loose Coupling, Horizontal Scaling, DRY, Abstraction/Easy-to-Change, Clean Architecture, and Observability & Delivery — then route sibling-owned depth instead of duplicating it.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION main steps (same order):** (1) resolve `mode=init`/`mode=audit` + scope; (2) load project context + evidence; (3) read `references/scorecard.md`; (4) score all 10 areas 0-2 with evidence; (5) run G1-G7, then TVC; (6) emit the report under `tmp/reports/`; (7) validate sub-80/risk findings with `$why-review` (maximum 2 passes), or record the zero-risk skip.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION modes/gates:** `mode=init` scores planned greenfield evidence; `mode=audit` scores existing evidence. Every score needs proof or explicit `N/A - reason`; unproven criteria score `0`. `TVC: BLOCKED` prevents a `setup complete` claim but never changes `/20`.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** Testability contract: resolve evidence-backed Unit/Integration/System/E2E rows, owner/root/data, copy-ready full/focused commands, zero-match failures, CI/simple Windows/macOS/Linux entry, unique run identity, and repeat proof before claiming setup, review, or test completion.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION advisory boundaries:** derive scale and business-criticality from evidence; Technique and Scenario matrices advise only and NEVER mutate `/20`, verdict, or G1-G7. Engineering Foundation `MISSING-WARRANTED` blocks when creating a foundation and stays advisory when auditing. A correctly-lean system is a PASS; new Tech/Lib recommendations require user confirmation.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION scale-technique gate:** derive T0 internal/single-instance, T1 small SaaS (<10k users), T2 high-scale (10k–1M), or T3 massive/multi-region (millions+) from evidence, then emit `PRESENT`/`MISSING-WARRANTED`/`N/A-by-scale`/`OVER-ENGINEERED`. Advise against unwarranted heavyweight techniques.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION scenario-stress gate:** reuse `T0`–`T3`, derive `B0`–`B3` with the criticality-signal floor, select warranted scenarios, trace stimulus → break path → failure signature → self-heal/MTTR → trade-off, and emit the advisory matrix. NEVER turn it into a score, verdict, or gate result.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** self-audit every grade, gap, and recommendation against the 11 thinking red flags in `.claude/docs/architecture-knowledge.md` §20.3 BEFORE emitting. A scale deduction without evidence, tool-first recommendation, unnamed forces/sacrifice, or `— VERIFY` source is re-derived or dropped, NEVER reworded.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** G5 requires a named ESCAPE HATCH from a metastable high-load state (shed / drain / warm / restart at lower concurrency). NEVER accept a latency number without its load-generation method; coordinated omission can delete the worst samples.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION trade-offs:** ALWAYS ask the 3 trade-off questions before every verdict, score, finding, or recommendation; name sacrifice, weigh gain vs cost, decide materiality, and confirm material choices with the user or hand them off. A material unconfirmed trade-off can NEVER be an unqualified PASS.

**Anti-Rationalization:**

| Evasion | Rebuttal |
| --- | --- |
| “This is only a diff.” | Keep the project-level `/20` scorecard; this skill is not the every-change diff reviewer. |
| “The plan names it.” | Require `file:line`/command/artifact proof or explicit `N/A - reason`; otherwise score `0`. |
| “The tool is standard.” | State the requirement, trade-off, and user confirmation before recommending new Tech/Lib. |
| “A lean system lacks scale tooling.” | Derive `T`/`B` from evidence and apply the anti-over-engineering guard; do not invent a scale gap. |
| “A latency number proves capacity.” | Require the load-generation method; G5 is at most `Partial` without it. |

> 2. Preserve cycle: `spec -> plan -> tasks -> implement -> verify -> update spec/docs`.

Resolve `specArtifacts` before selecting identity or carrier: use a valid profile, use strict-default TC/test identity only when the profile is absent, and block a malformed or unsupported declaration.

## SYNC:ai-sdd-artifact-contract:reminder

- **MANDATORY** Apply `shared/sdd-artifact-contract.md`; keep reusable AI-SDD in `.claude` and local rules in project docs.
- **MANDATORY** Resolve and validate `specArtifacts`: use valid native owner/case/variant identity and assertion-bearing evidence; use strict-default TC/TestSpec only when the profile is absent; block a malformed or unsupported declaration without fallback.
- **MANDATORY** Code-to-spec extraction is reference-only until canonical acceptance; any supported AI tool may execute with synced context.
- **MANDATORY** Update `.claude` source before syncing generated mirrors; do not manually edit `.agents`, `.codex`, or `AGENTS.md`.
- **MANDATORY** Missing or stale project config, root instruction files, or required reference docs route project-specific work through `$project-init` or the narrow setup route automatically.
**[TASK-PLANNING] [MANDATORY]** BEFORE executing any workflow or skill step, create/update task tracking for all planned steps, analyze the task graph (output dependencies, shared write targets) into ordered parallel waves per PARALLELIZE before starting any task, then keep it synchronized as each step starts/completes. Preserve fixed ordering when a skill or workflow explicitly fixes it.
- **MANDATORY** Pin `Original goal:` before the first action and keep `User prompts this session: P1…Pn` current; re-read both at every step, before delegation, and after compaction.
- **MANDATORY** Before claiming done, map the result to the original goal and every prompt (`P# → done | deferred | n/a`); never store secrets in them.
## [LESSON-LEARNED-REMINDER] [BLOCKING] Task Planning & Continuous Improvement — MANDATORY. Do not skip.

Break work into small tasks (task tracking) before starting. Add final task: "Analyze AI mistakes & lessons learned".

**Extract lessons — ROOT CAUSE ONLY, not symptom fixes:**
1. Name the FAILURE MODE (reasoning/assumption failure), not symptom — "assumed API existed without reading source" not "used wrong enum value".
2. Generality test: does this failure mode apply to ≥3 contexts/codebases? If not, abstract one level up.
3. Write as a universal rule — strip project-specific names/paths/classes. Useful on any codebase.
4. Consolidate: multiple mistakes sharing one failure mode → ONE lesson.
5. **Recurrence gate:** "Would this recur in future session WITHOUT this reminder?" — No → skip `$learn`.
6. **Auto-fix gate:** "Could `$code-review`/`$code-simplifier`/`$security-review`/a linter catch this?" — Yes → improve review skill instead.
7. BOTH gates pass → ask user to run `$learn`.
**[CRITICAL-THINKING-MINDSET]** Apply critical thinking, sequential thinking. Every claim needs traced proof, confidence >80% to act.
**Anti-hallucination principle:** Never present guess as fact — cite sources for every claim, admit uncertainty freely, self-check output for errors, cross-reference independently, stay skeptical of own confidence — certainty without evidence root of all hallucination.
**AI Attention principle (Primacy-Recency):** Put the 3 most critical rules at both top and bottom of long prompts/protocols so instruction adherence survives long context windows.
**Goal-driven execution:** Define success criteria first, loop until verified, and stop only when observable checks pass.
**Tests verify intent:** Tests must protect business rules/invariants and fail when the protected intent breaks, not only mirror current behavior.
**Judgement integrity:** For theory checks, judgements, evaluations and gap hunts, the prompt's premise is a hypothesis — test it AND its opposite with one evidence bar (web-verify external facts), why-review the draft as an inline self-check (run the `why-review` skill only for a formal review/audit/gap-hunt deliverable or a MEDIUM+/consequential issue the inline pass cannot settle), never invent findings or manufacture disagreement ("no material issues" is a valid verdict); end with a `Bias check:` line (`SYNC:judgement-integrity`).
## Common AI Mistake Prevention (System Lessons)

- **Resolve project applicability before using framework examples.** Read the project config and relevant references, then inspect local evidence; honor explicit N/A and never impose a language, framework, architecture layer, styling method, tool, or runtime surface the project does not use.
- **ROOT-CAUSE GATE — INVESTIGATE FIRST.** Before applying any project-related correction, always use the project's root-cause investigation protocol and establish the cause; the failure site may be only a symptom.
- **FAILED-TEST GATE.** For any failed or unstable test, use the project's test-investigation protocol before editing source or tests; never change either side merely to force green.
- **Re-read and re-verify after context compaction or resume.** Compaction wipes read state and memory; summaries describe intent, not environment state. Re-read before editing, audit current state (git status, files) before creating anything new, grep-verify sub-agent output — every "completed" claim is a hypothesis until evidence confirms it.
- **Verify AI-generated content against actual code.** AI hallucinates APIs, class names, method signatures. Grep to confirm existence before documenting/referencing.
- **Trace every consumer before and after a change.** Map referencing files before deleting; after bulk replacements, renames, or extractions, grep ALL consumer file types (templates, configs, catalogs and generated files fail silently) for every old or removed name; trace the full dependency chain of an edited definition; update docs that embed canonical data alongside their source.
- **Trace ALL code paths when verifying correctness.** Code existing ≠ code executing. Trace early exits, error branches, conditional skips — not just happy path.
- **Sub-agents: inherit, cover, persist.** Sub-agents know only their agent .md definition — use custom agent types, not built-in Explore. Reconcile the union of assignments against the full target list — category splits miss boundary items. Make the report write the first deliverable, appended per file/section with bounded scope; a truncated run with no report → spawn a narrower scope, never the same prompt.
- **Ownership before action.** When investigating a failure, ask which part owns the behavior before changing anything. Trace the wrong state to the component responsible for its invariant, then make one authoritative correction there.
- **Test failure → record a provisional verdict before trace/edit, then investigate.** Use the full five-way taxonomy: SOURCE-WRONG (production violates intent), TEST-WRONG (assertion/setup is stale), TEST-NOT-OPTIMAL (valid but fragile or low-signal test), ENVIRONMENT-BLOCKED (external state prevents a verdict), or AMBIGUOUS (intent/evidence cannot choose safely). Then trace root cause and triangulate against the governing spec if one exists (the business spec root — default `docs/specs`; a `specRoots.business.path` entry in `docs/project-config.json` overrides the path) AND source. NEVER weaken an assertion, add a skip, relax a timeout, or change source merely to force green.
- **Assume existing values are intentional — ask WHY before changing OR flagging one as a defect.** Before changing or reporting any constant/limit/flag/cutoff, read comments, git blame, the CALLER's ordering (the guarantee usually runs immediately BEFORE the cited line), and 2+ sibling call sites. A doc stating WHAT without WHY is missing rationale, not proof of a missing guard — and an accurate `file:line` citation proves the transcription, never the defect.
- **Verify ALL affected outputs, not just the first.** One build green ≠ all green. Multi-stack changes (backend/frontend/tests/docs) require verifying EVERY output.
- **Evaluate fit before copying a nearby pattern.** Closest example ≠ matching preconditions — verify the new context shares the same constraints, base classes, scope, lifetime.
- **Holistic analysis — resist the nearest-attention trap.** Do not dive into the first plausible cause. List every precondition (configuration, environment, inputs, dependencies, versions, permissions, state) and verify each against evidence. Ask "what would falsify this?" — if nothing, it is not a hypothesis.
- **Minimal changes — apply the relevance test.** Every change must trace to the reported problem: "Would this change exist if I were not addressing this request?" — if not, remove or disclose it; never silently expand scope.
- **Surface ambiguity before coding — don't pick silently.** Multiple valid interpretations → present each with effort ("(1) [N h], (2) [N h]. Which matters?"), list assumptions, name a simpler path when one exists.
- **Why-Review adversarial mindset — apply when reviewing any plan, decision, or design.** Default SKEPTIC: steel-man a rejected alternative, invert each reason ("what does it sacrifice?"), stress-test the top 2-3 assumptions, run a pre-mortem. Quality = causal reasoning + mitigations + evidence, not section presence.
- **OOM/memory: check row count before row size.** An unbounded query (no DB filter for the trigger) → push the filter to the DB; then large rows → projection. Row reduction > projection in ROI.
- **Assert the outcome your system OWNS, never the intermediate state your INFRASTRUCTURE owns.** For async work (queues, retries, background jobs, caches, replication) assert the final business/entity state — NEVER delivery bookkeeping (consume/send status, attempt counts, last-error, broker/scheduler/outbox rows) that ANY co-running process can write: green alone, flaky once anything shares that broker + database. Gate: "would this hold no matter WHICH process did the work?" Process-local fault injection is a stress amplifier (arm → bounded window → disarm → assert convergence), never a precondition.
- **Store disposable generated output in the project workspace.** If an output can be regenerated and is not source code, a canonical source-of-truth, or an intentionally versioned projection, write it under the project-root `tmp/` or `temp/` directory (prefer `tmp/`), scoped to the run. This includes temporary state, integration/E2E results, reports, logs, screenshots, traces, videos, coverage, dumps, and candidate evidence. Never put these outputs in source, docs, the plans root (default `plans/`; a `docsRoots.plans.path` entry in `docs/project-config.json` overrides the path), the team-artifacts root (default `team-artifacts/`; `docsRoots.teamArtifacts.path` in the same config overrides the path), or mirror directories; the project-root `.gitignore` must ignore `/tmp/` and `/temp/` by default. Committed fixtures, accepted baselines, canonical specs/docs, and explicitly versioned generated mirrors remain at their declared owner paths.
- **Judge the environment before judging the code — a competing hypothesis, not a fallback.** A bug, failed test, error, or odd output is NOT proof of a code defect. Before any verdict, sweep environment preconditions (toolchain/lockfile state, stale build/cache artifacts, env vars and config, service dependencies, ports/clock, OS path/locale, permissions, leftover processes/test data) AND transient resource pressure (RAM/OOM, CPU, disk/temp, handle and connection-pool limits, network, a timeout that is really slowness). Tell-tale: non-deterministic, fails only in parallel, on one machine or only on CI, or an error naming resources. Cite the discriminator you ran (clean environment? path changed? concurrency 1?) — a verdict without one is a guess. Fix an environment cause in the environment; NEVER edit product code or weaken/skip a test to absorb it; a failure that vanishes on retry stays unexplained until its mechanism is named.
- **Cross-platform execution is a required contract.** Before authoring or changing a tool, script, process launcher, path assertion, or filesystem test, name the supported Windows, macOS, and Linux behaviors. Use platform-neutral APIs and literal argv vectors; never infer shell, temp-path, executable-extension, ACL, or symlink semantics from the current host. A documented command gives its Windows, macOS, and Linux form (Python: `py -3` on Windows, `python3` on macOS/Linux; shell: PowerShell/`.cmd` beside POSIX `sh`) or one platform-neutral runner such as `node <script>`. Canonicalize existing paths before identity, hashing, or equality checks; test native Windows and POSIX seams when behavior differs; keep CI platform matrices authoritative. Preserve fail-closed security boundaries — repair the fixture or platform branch, never weaken the guard just to make one OS green.
- **Keep domain concepts out of generic/shared/infrastructure layers.** A reusable layer must reference NO consumer-specific domain concept (tenant/customer/product IDs, business entities, feature rules); such a leak compiles, runs, and passes review while coupling the layer to one consumer. Push domain fields/logic down into the consumer via subclass/composition.
