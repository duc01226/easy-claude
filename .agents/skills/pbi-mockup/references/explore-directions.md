# Explore Directions — 1–3 design directions before the full mock app (`--explore`)

> **Purpose:** with `--explore`, `pbi-mockup` Step 3d builds N divergent direction drafts (N = the `SKILL.md` Step 0 count: 1, 2 or 3) of the primary journey's KEY views, renders them with html-export, opens them and asks the user to pick one by looking at the drafts (or records the auto-selection when the user cannot be asked), records that choice, and then Step 4 builds the full interactive mock app in the chosen direction. Without `--explore` this file is not read and the skill stays single-direction.
>
> **Critical rules (read first):**
>
> 1. **Journey first, directions second.** Explore starts only after the Step 2a Journey Report (`UX-1`), the Step 2b/2c surface and flow plans, and the Step 3/3b design-authority read (`UX-2`) exist. All N drafts serve the SAME journeys, views, information-priority tiers, primary actions and rule treatments — they diverge ONLY on FREE visual axes and the layout skeleton. — why: a direction that changes what the user sees first is a different product, not a different look, and the pick would compare incomparable things.
> 2. **Authority first.** An axis pinned by the brief, the project design system or the existing UI is ADOPTED, never re-explored; a design system that pins colour, type AND layout skips explore with a logged reason. — why: a house style is an intentional identity; re-deciding it per PBI is incoherence.
> 3. **The user picks from drafts, never from text.** After presenting the N rendered drafts, open them in the default browser and ask with ask the user directly, your evidence-backed recommendation first; never pick for the user while they can be asked (no way to show the drafts or no question tool → AUTO-SELECT the recommended draft, Step 7); "continue", "looks good" and silence are NOT a pick. — why: the choice is the user's, and a paraphrased or assumed pick is not evidence.

Read this file at Step 3d, when `--explore` is set. It adapts the design skill's explore procedure — `.claude/skills/design/references/explore/workflow.md` (steps cited below as `explore step N`) — to a mock app; that file stays the source for the shared mechanics, and the gate-file templates are in `.claude/skills/design/references/explore/gate-files.md`. Create ONE task per step below. All run artifacts live under `tmp/design/<run>/`, where `<run>` is `YYMMDD-HHmm-<pbi-or-spec-slug>` — disposable run output, never project docs.

## Step 0 — Apply the scope decision from `SKILL.md` Step 0

The user was asked at `SKILL.md` Step 0, before any analysis, so that a skip saves the whole run. Here, only the answer is applied:

- **Question tool available → asked at `SKILL.md` Step 0** with ask the user directly: "Generate design mockup options for <surface>?" Options: `3 options` · `2 options` · `1 option` · `Skip mockup`. Mark one `(Recommended)` by scope: a new page or multi-view flow → 3; a single component or dialog → 1–2.
- **`Skip mockup`** → handled at `SKILL.md` Step 0; this file is never read.
- **`1 option`** → build ONE draft in your recommended direction: Steps 1–6 (Step 4 one seed, Step 5 one sub-agent; Step 6 renders, reads the exit code and runs the `DD-8` critique), then open it in the default browser as Step 7 does — no question, no pick needed — record `Selection: USER — 1 option` and go to Step 8.
- **`2 options` / `3 options`** → run Steps 1–8 with N = that many drafts (`direction-a`, `-b`[, `-c`]) and N seeds.
- **Question tool NOT available** (a non-interactive host, a sub-agent only when no session in the run can ask the user, an autonomous or scheduled run) → generate ONLY ONE mockup in the recommended direction (best main-journey fit `UX-4`/`UX-9`/`UX-10` and best fit with the project design system and existing UI `UX-2`). Run it as the `1 option` path (Steps 1–6, open, Step 8), auto-select it, record `Selection: AUTO-SELECTED — no question tool (1 draft)` in `direction-approved.md` and in the plan or run report, and continue.

Step 2 can override the count: when authority pins every axis, explore is skipped and the answer is logged as superseded by the exemption.

## Step 1 — Persist the shared inputs

Sub-agents inherit nothing from this conversation, so write the inputs every draft needs to disk first:

- `tmp/design/<run>/journey-report.md` — the Step 2a Journey Report, verbatim.
- `tmp/design/<run>/run-notes.md` (template: gate-files `run-notes.md`) — plus a **Key views** section: the primary journey (`J1`, the top-ranked main journey) and the 2–4 views from the Step 2b inventory that host its steps, each with its hosted steps, container, information-priority tiers (Primary · Secondary · On demand · Not here) and ONE primary action (`UX-4`), the rule → interaction treatments on those steps (`UX-5`), the states each view must show (empty/loading/error first, `UI-1.5`), and the realistic domain sample data from Step 3c.
- The low-fi structure (`UX-7`): an ASCII sketch of each key view and the J1 path across them, walked once on the sketch before any draft exists. A step the sketch cannot serve is fixed in the plan now, not in N drafts later.

Key views only — not the whole app. The drafts compare directions; the full surface is built once, in Step 4, in the chosen direction.

## Step 2 — Resolve authority per axis

Classify **colour · type · layout** as `ADOPTED — <source>` or `FREE`, from the Step 3 design-system docs (`designSystem.canonicalDoc`, matched `appMappings[]` doc, token files) and the Step 3b existing-UI inventory, exactly as explore step 1 does.

| Situation | Action |
| --- | --- |
| The brief states a visual direction | `ADOPTED — brief`; write the exemption; skip explore |
| The project design system (or existing UI the PBI extends) pins ALL three axes | `ADOPTED — <doc path §>` per axis; write the exemption; skip explore |
| The user explicitly opts out | Record the opt-out verbatim as the exemption; skip explore |
| Some axes pinned | The pinned axes are shared by all N drafts; drafts diverge only on the FREE axes |
| Nothing pinned | All three axes `FREE` |

**Exemption** → write `tmp/design/<run>/direction-approved.md` with its `Exemption` section filled (reason + verbatim quote or doc path and section), set `Next` to `pbi-mockup Step 4 in the adopted direction`, log `Explore: SKIPPED — <reason>` in the Step 6 report, and continue at Step 4 single-direction. A genuine conflict between the brief and the design system goes to the user with both sides — never resolved silently.

## Step 3 — Facts, references, brand, imagery, canvas

Run explore steps 2–5 as written: fact-check any named product or standard; ask the ONE optional reference question; run `.claude/skills/design/references/explore/brand-asset-protocol.md` only when the brief names a real external brand (the project's own design system is authority, not a brand to scrape — record `Brand: N/A — project design system` otherwise); gather one shared imagery set only when content needs real images.

Canvas: an app screen → `--viewport=1440x900,390x844` unless the brief or the project states another size. Write the `DD-3` Design Plan skeleton — subject · audience · job (`DD-1`), canvas, ADOPTED axes with sources, FREE axes left open — shared by all N drafts.

## Step 4 — Pick N divergence seeds

Explore step 6 (take the first N): (a) `node .claude/skills/design/scripts/pick-style.cjs` · (b) the user's liked reference, else one web-verified published design from an adjacent field, cited by URL · (c) a studio persona described only by traits, never a real name. A seed that clashes with an ADOPTED axis only informs the free axes.

## Step 5 — Fan out N drafts in ONE message

Spawn N `ui-ux-designer` sub-agents in ONE message (all-return barrier). Each brief is self-contained and carries:

- the paths `tmp/design/<run>/journey-report.md` and `run-notes.md`, the Design Plan skeleton, the canvas, and every ADOPTED axis with its source;
- its ONE seed, plus `brand-spec.md` / `product-facts.md` paths and the shared imagery set when they exist, and any disliked reference to avoid;
- the **same-journey rule**, verbatim: "Build ONLY the key views listed in run-notes.md for journey J1. Keep every view's hosted steps, information-priority tiers, single primary action, rule treatments, states and sample data exactly as listed. Diverge only on the FREE axes and the layout skeleton.";
- **when layout is FREE:** a layout skeleton STRUCTURALLY different from the other drafts (a different reading order, not a recoloured copy) that still keeps each view's Primary tier as its single focal point. **When layout is ADOPTED:** the pinned layout, unchanged;
- the grounding rule and the asset rule from explore step 7, verbatim;
- the gates: `UX-1`–`UX-11`, `DD-1`–`DD-8`, `UI-1.1`–`UI-9.4`, `CL-1`–`CL-6`, with `.claude/docs/ux-journey-process.md`, `.claude/docs/design-knowledge.md`, `.claude/docs/design-review-checklist.md` and the resolved project design-system doc paths;
- the output: ONE self-contained HTML file `tmp/design/<run>/direction-{a|b|c}.html` with each key view as an element marked `data-export-slide` (in J1 step order; simple click-through between them is welcome, full demo controls are not needed), plus a short note: the Design Plan built, what the generic test (`DD-3`) made it revise, and how the direction serves each J1 step.

**No sub-agent capability →** build the N drafts serially; draft b states what it avoided from a, draft c what it avoided from a and b.

## Step 6 — All-return barrier, then render

Wait until all N drafts exist. Before rendering, check each draft kept the same-journey rule (same views, same Primary tier and primary action per view); a draft that drifted is sent back, not rendered. Render each into its own folder at the Step 3 canvas:

```bash
node .claude/skills/html-export/scripts/export.cjs --to=png --viewport=<canvas> --slides --out=tmp/design/<run>/renders/direction-a/ tmp/design/<run>/direction-a.html
```

Repeat for each other draft (`direction-b`, `direction-c`). The bare `--slides` captures every `data-export-slide` key view; a `stacked` navigation fallback in `report.json` is still valid evidence. No `--offline` for the same reason explore step 8 gives; a draft that breaks the asset rule is fixed, or rendered with `--offline` and labelled.

Read the exit code first (`.claude/skills/html-export/SKILL.md` `## Calling from other skills`):

| Exit | Action |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | Evidence only as html-export scopes it (loaded, no page error, no blank capture). Open the PNGs `report.json` `files[]` names and judge them |
| 4 | Page fault — fix the draft, re-render |
| 3 | Mark the draft `NOT VERIFIABLE`, list its HTML path, one-line pointer to html-export setup. NEVER run an install command |
| 1 or 2 | Tool failure — quote stderr, mark `NOT VERIFIABLE`, list the HTML path. Never count it as a design defect or a pass |

Any other exit code (such as 130 after an interrupt) is an interrupted render: handle it like 1 or 2. Only files this run's `report.json` names are evidence; a reused `--out` keeps older PNGs. Critique each rendered draft against `DD-8`, remove one accessory, re-render; if that re-render fails, label the old PNG `stale — predates the DD-8 edit`.

## Step 7 — Present side by side, open, recommend and ASK

Show the N drafts side by side — the PNGs (or HTML paths marked `NOT VERIFIABLE`). Per draft, in business terms:

- its seed and its layout skeleton (or the free axes it varied when layout is ADOPTED);
- **how it serves the primary journey** — where the Primary-tier information and the one primary action sit on each key view, how the user moves between J1's steps, and what the direction trades away;
- what makes it THIS product's interface (`DD-1`).

**Open every draft in the user's default browser** — run `node .claude/scripts/open-report.cjs tmp/design/<run>/direction-<x>.html` once per draft; it opens nothing in CI or headless sessions and always prints the path. Then **ask with ask the user directly**: one option per draft, each labelled with its one-line summary and PNG/HTML path; put YOUR RECOMMENDED draft FIRST, labelled `(Recommended)`, with the evidence for it — which draft best serves the primary journey (Primary tier in the first viewport `UX-4`, lowest interaction cost `UX-9`, clearest wayfinding `UX-10`) and fits the subject (`DD-1`). The question's free-text answer covers a mix or "none fit". A recommendation is NOT a pick: only the user's answer is recorded. Never pick for the user while they can be asked, and never offer a text-only style choice instead of the drafts.

**Fallback: auto-select when the user cannot be asked.** A missing question tool is settled BEFORE drafting (one draft only, auto-selected). This fallback covers the later cases: the drafts cannot be shown (the browser open fails or is skipped, for example in CI, headless or no-display runs, AND no rendered PNG can be shown in the conversation) OR ask the user directly errors after the drafts exist. Do NOT block. AUTO-SELECT your recommended draft: the one that best serves the main journeys (Primary tier in the first viewport `UX-4`, lowest interaction cost `UX-9`, clearest wayfinding `UX-10`) AND best fits the project's design system and existing UI (`UX-2`). Record it in `direction-approved.md` as `Selection: AUTO-SELECTED — <fallback reason>`, with the evidence and the trade-offs of the drafts not chosen. Carry that note into the plan's UI Layout or the run report, continue working, and name it in the final hand-off so the user can re-pick later.

## Step 8 — Record the pick, then build the full mock app

Write `tmp/design/<run>/direction-approved.md` from the gate-files template, `Pick` section filled with the user's reply quoted verbatim — or, on the 1-option, no-question-tool or fallback paths, the recorded `Selection: USER — 1 option` / `Selection: AUTO-SELECTED — <reason>` line (never ask again on those paths). While the user can be asked, "continue", "looks good" or silence is NOT a pick — ask again. A mix ("a's layout with c's type") is valid: record it verbatim with the parts taken from each draft. "None fit" → record it, pick N new seeds (Step 4) and repeat from Step 5. Set `Next` to `pbi-mockup Step 4 from tmp/design/<run>/direction-<x>.html`.

Return to `SKILL.md` Step 4: the chosen direction's visual axes and layout skeleton are now FIXED inputs, applied to EVERY view of the Step 2b inventory and every Step 2c flow — not only the key views. The draft is raised to the full bar (prototype engine, guided walkthrough, all states, `UI-*` build constraints). Step 6 reports the run folder and `direction-approved.md`; Step 7 fidelity also checks the mock app matches the approved direction.

## Closing Reminders

- **MUST** start explore only after the Journey Report, the surface/flow plans and the design-authority read exist, and keep all N drafts on the SAME journeys, views, priority tiers, primary actions, rules and data — why: the pick must compare looks, not different products.
- **MUST** resolve authority per axis first; a design system pinning colour, type and layout skips explore with a logged exemption — why: a house style is an intentional identity.
- **MUST** fan out N (the Step 0 count) `ui-ux-designer` sub-agents in ONE message, draft KEY views of the primary journey only, and render each draft with html-export into its own `--out` folder, reading the exit code first and never installing dependencies — why: parallel drafts avoid convergence, and a written PNG is not evidence until the exit code and manifest say so.
- **MUST** open every draft in the default browser and, with 2–3 drafts, ask with ask the user directly (recommended draft first, with evidence), never pick for the user while they can be asked (no browser/PNG or no question tool → AUTO-SELECT the recommended draft, recorded with its reason), record the verbatim pick or the `Selection:` line in `direction-approved.md`, then build the FULL mock app in that direction at Step 4 — why: the pick is the user's decision, and the drafts are not the deliverable.
