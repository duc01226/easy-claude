# `$plan --mode=validate` — critical-questions plan validation reference

> Loaded by `plan/SKILL.md`'s Mode Dispatch when invoked as `$plan --mode=validate [plan-path]`. This contract REPLACES default plan creation for the invocation: interview the user about a finished plan, record the answers on `plan.md`, stop. It never rewrites the plan or its phase files.

> **[BLOCKING]** Run declared steps in order. NEVER skip, reorder, or merge without explicit user approval.
> **[BLOCKING]** Before each step/sub-skill, update task tracking: `in_progress` at start, `completed` at end.
> **[BLOCKING]** Every completed/skipped step MUST include brief evidence or an explicit skip reason.
> **[BLOCKING]** If Task tools unavailable, maintain an equivalent step tracker with the same status transitions.

## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Force every assumption-laden plan decision and every preservation-critical behavior through explicit user confirmation BEFORE implementation — by interviewing the user with critical questions that validate assumptions and surface issues — so no unstated assumption silently reaches code.

**Summary:**

- **Purpose:** validate a finished plan via a critical-questions interview so every assumption-laden decision and every preservation-critical behavior is user-confirmed BEFORE implementation — no unstated assumption silently reaches code.
- **Main steps (run in order):** Phase 0 Detect Plan Type → resolve plan path (`$ARGUMENTS` / `## Plan Context` / ask) → load `mode` + `questions` range as hard constraints → Phase 0.5 resolve Applicability / Plan Gate → Step 1 Read `plan.md` + all `phase-*.md`, flag decisions/assumptions/risks/tradeoffs → Step 2 Extract topics across 9 categories (Applicability, Architecture, Assumptions, Tradeoffs, Risks, Scope, New Tech/Lib, Test Specs, Preservation) → Step 3 Generate questions (2-4 concrete options each, surface implicit decisions, plus probes of the plan's Quality Gates & Concerns Checklist) → Step 4 Interview by asking the user directly (≤4 per call) → Step 5 Document answers → offer implement/refine/skip.
- **Phase 0 weights everything:** plan type (bugfix/feature/migration/refactor/other) decides which question categories fire; any fix/bug/regression/broken/defect keyword makes the Preservation question BLOCKING — never skip it.
- **The output is a REAL interview, not a self-answer:** honor the `questions` MIN-MAX range from `## Plan Context`, give 2-4 concrete options per question, treat the Preservation "Unsure" answer as BLOCKED → route to `$plan`; if the plan adds new tech/packages, probe whether alternatives were evaluated before accepting the choice.
- **Persist results narrowly:** add ONLY a `## Validation Summary` (confirmed decisions + action items) to `plan.md` — NEVER edit phase files; close by offering implement/refine/skip by asking the user directly.
- **Applicability is mandatory for every plan:** read `.claude/skills/shared/product-roadmap-contract.md`, verify the plan's branch-specific `## Plan Gate`, and ask the owner to confirm the embedded slice/decomposition, explicit roadmap outcome, framework technical outcome, or EXEMPT boundary plus non-goals, scenario proof, commands, evidence, and approval. `BLOCKED`, `OPEN`, `MISSING`, or `REQUIRED` cannot be silently upgraded.

**Workflow:**

1. **Detect Plan Type** — Classify plan (bugfix/feature/migration/refactor) to weight question categories
2. **Read Plan** — Parse plan.md + phase files for decisions, assumptions, risks
3. **Extract Topics** — Scan architecture, assumptions, tradeoffs, risks, scope keywords
4. **Generate Questions** — Formulate concrete questions with 2-4 options each
5. **Interview User** — Present questions using configured count range
6. **Document Answers** — Add Validation Summary section to plan.md

**Key Rules:**

- MUST ATTENTION use ask the user directly — NEVER auto-decide on behalf of user — why: the user owns every assumption-laden choice, not the agent
- Ask ONLY about genuine choices affecting implementation — NEVER about non-decision points — why: noise questions burn the interview budget and erode trust
- Bugfix plans ALWAYS trigger the Preservation question (keywords: fix, bug, regression, broken, defect) — why: an unverified preserved-correctness invariant is a silent regression
- Persist via a `## Validation Summary` on `plan.md` — NEVER modify phase files — why: phase files are the plan's source of truth; validation is a read-then-annotate pass
- For embedded, explicit-roadmap, framework/library, or EXEMPT plans, include the final applicability status and exact owning paths in that same summary; use each branch only when the plan records its required evidence and owner.

## Phase 0: Detect Plan Type

Classify plan type BEFORE generating questions; it drives category weighting:

| Plan Type     | Detection                                                         | Mandatory Extra Categories            |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Bugfix**    | Title/frontmatter: `fix`, `bug`, `regression`, `broken`, `defect` | Preservation (BLOCKING)               |
| **Feature**   | New capability, no fix keywords                                   | Architecture, Assumptions, Test Specs |
| **Migration** | Schema change, EF migration, data move                            | Risks, Preservation, Scope            |
| **Refactor**  | Restructure/clean up, no behavior change                          | Preservation, Tradeoffs               |
| **Other**     | None of above                                                     | Architecture, Scope                   |

**Bugfix detection is BLOCKING** — NEVER skip Preservation question when fix/bug/regression/broken/defect keywords present.

## Plan Resolution

1. `$ARGUMENTS` provided (the path after the mode flag) → use that path
2. Else use the active path from `## Plan Context`
3. No plan → ask user for a path or run `$plan` first

## Phase 0.5: Applicability / Plan Gate

Before extracting technical questions, classify the plan's branch.

- Embedded large-idea: read the owning PBI/spec; verify complete `large_idea_decomposition`, selected slice, non-goals/deferred owners, and conditional scenario artifact when needed. Do not require the product roadmap (default `docs/product-roadmap.md`; a `docsRoots.productRoadmap.path` entry in `docs/project-config.json` overrides the path) or a product milestone.
- Explicit roadmap: read the product roadmap (default `docs/product-roadmap.md`; a `docsRoots.productRoadmap.path` entry in `docs/project-config.json` overrides the path), selected milestone scope brief, and `scenario-analysis.md`.
- Framework/library: read technical scope, operational scenarios, generated-carrier evidence, and commands.
- Verify one `## Plan Gate` in `plan.md`: matching branch/outcome/boundaries; explicit non-goals; lifecycle terms when applicable; branch decision state; known or explicitly inapplicable skeleton/configuration; build/test/run commands; redacted evidence; `Human approval: APPROVED`.
- Missing upstream artifacts or `BLOCKED`/`OPEN`/`MISSING`/`REQUIRED` values create a blocking Applicability question. Do not implement or recommend `implement` while unresolved.
- Isolated brownfield/bugfix: verify the shared contract's EXEMPT branch: scope brief and plan reason/owner, required sibling scenario, explicit `EXEMPT` roadmap/milestone, explicit `N/A` product-decision rationale, known commands/evidence/approval. Retain preservation/spec/test/review questions.

## Configuration (from injected context)

Check `## Plan Context` section:

- `mode` — auto/prompt/off
- `questions` — MIN-MAX range (e.g. `3-8`)

Treat both as hard constraints.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Read Plan Files

Read plan directory:

- `plan.md` — overview + phases list
- `phase-*.md` — all phase files
- Flag: decision points, assumptions, risks, tradeoffs

### Step 2: Extract Question Topics

| Category         | Keywords                                                                                   |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Architecture** | approach, pattern, design, structure, database, API                                        |
| **Assumptions**  | assume, expect, should, will, must, default                                                |
| **Tradeoffs**    | tradeoff, vs, alternative, option, choice, either/or                                       |
| **Risks**        | risk, might, could fail, dependency, blocker, concern                                      |
| **Scope**        | phase, MVP, future, out of scope, nice to have                                             |
| **New Tech/Lib** | install, add package, new dependency, npm install, dotnet add, unfamiliar framework names  |
| **Test Specs**   | TC-, test case, coverage, TDD, test specification                                          |
| **Preservation** | auto-trigger on bugfix keywords in title/frontmatter — scan Preservation Inventory section |
| **Product Readiness** | roadmap-applicable or EXEMPT plan — scan the applicable `## Plan Gate` branch, scope/scenario refs, non-goals, definitions, evidence, and human approval |

### Step 3: Generate Questions

**Quality-gates probes (BLOCKING — read `references/plan-quality-checklist.md` in full first; its Validate duty owns them).** When the plan has a `## Quality Gates & Concerns Checklist`, ask about it as genuine decisions, each with 2-4 concrete options: which gate is most likely to fail and what would prevent it; what evidence would change a verdict (a PASS expectation or a NO row); which NO row was marked too quickly and what would make it YES; which open concern has no settling step. A plan with no checklist gets one blocking question: add a task-derived checklist now or accept the exemption. Validate never edits the plan beyond `## Validation Summary`: record the answer there — "add now" becomes an action item routed to `$plan` (which authors the section), "accept the exemption" is recorded as the owner's accepted exemption. Count these inside the `questions` range; never add a question that only restates the plan.

**Format rules:**

- 2-4 concrete options per question
- Mark recommended with "(Recommended)" suffix
- "Other" option automatic — do NOT add
- Surface implicit decisions

For a roadmap-applicable plan, ask a Product Readiness question before lower-level choices:

> Does the plan implement the owning slice/outcome or technical boundary exactly, with the stated non-goals, lifecycle definitions where applicable, scenario proof, known skeleton/commands, redacted evidence, and human approval?

Offer concrete choices such as: **Yes, approve the Plan Gate (Recommended)**; **No, revise the scope/plan**; **A product decision remains open**; **This plan is an explicitly accepted isolated-change exemption**. Never answer this question from the plan author's confidence alone.

**Examples:**

```
Category: Architecture
Question: "How should validation results be persisted?"
Options:
1. Save to plan.md frontmatter (Recommended) — updates existing plan
2. Create validation-answers.md — separate answers file
3. Don't persist — ephemeral validation only
```

```
Category: Assumptions
Question: "Plan assumes API rate limiting not needed. Correct?"
Options:
1. Yes, not needed for MVP
2. No, add basic rate limiting now (Recommended)
3. Defer to Phase 2
```

```
Category: Preservation (MANDATORY when title/frontmatter: fix, bug, regression, broken, defect)
Question: "List 2-3 inputs where CURRENT code is correct. Will fix change behavior on any?"
Options (multi-select):
1. "Current code correct on: {input A}. Fix preserves behavior." (Recommended)
2. "Current code correct on: {input B}. Fix CHANGES behavior because: {justification}"
3. "Current code has NO preserved-correctness inputs — every input was broken" (rare; requires confirmation)
4. "Unsure — need to investigate" (STOP: run $plan preservation analysis)
```

**Follow-up rules:**

- Option 2 selected → `plan.md` Preservation Inventory MUST cite Preservation TC asserting new behavior is intended
- Option 4 selected → return BLOCKED status, recommend `$plan` before proceeding
- Option 3 selected → ask the user directly follow-up: "Confirm: current code has NO preserved invariant? [Yes, every input broken / No, missed some — re-investigate]"

### Step 4: Interview User

Use ask the user directly — NEVER skip or auto-answer.

**Rules:**

- Use question count from `## Plan Context` → `Validation: mode=X, questions=MIN-MAX`
- Group related questions (max 4 per tool call)
- Focus: assumptions, risks, tradeoffs, architecture
- MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION: if plan introduces new tech/packages, ask: "Plan uses {lib}. Were alternatives evaluated? Confirm choice or research more?"

### Step 5: Document Answers

Add `## Validation Summary` to `plan.md`:

```markdown
## Validation Summary

**Validated:** {date}
**Questions asked:** {count}

### Applicability

- **Branch:** DECOMPOSITION-EMBEDDED | EXPLICIT-ROADMAP | FRAMEWORK-LIBRARY | EXEMPT | BLOCKED
- **Owning artifact / roadmap:** `{paths}` or `NOT APPLICABLE — embedded/framework/EXEMPT`
- **Slice / milestone / technical outcome:** `{ID and outcome}`
- **Scope handoff / scenarios:** `{paths or conditional N/A}`
- **Plan Gate:** DECOMPOSITION-EMBEDDED | READY | FRAMEWORK-LIBRARY | EXEMPT | BLOCKED
- **Human approval:** APPROVED | REQUIRED

### Confirmed Decisions

- {decision 1}: {user choice}
- {decision 2}: {user choice}

### Action Items

- [ ] {changes needed based on answers}
```

NEVER modify phase files — only document what needs updating.

## Output

After validation:

- Questions asked count
- Key decisions confirmed
- Items flagged for plan revision
- Recommendation: proceed to implementation OR revise plan first

## Next Steps

**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION — NO EXCEPTIONS** after completing, use ask the user directly to present:

- **"$feature-implement (Recommended)"** — Begin implementation with validated plan
- **"$pbi --mode=refine"** — If plan needs PBI refinement first
- **"Skip, continue manually"** — User decides

---

> **[BLOCKING]** MUST ATTENTION use ask the user directly to interview user. Completing without asking ≥1 question = violation.

> **[IMPORTANT]** Use task tracking to break ALL work into small tasks BEFORE starting — including tasks for each file read. For simple tasks, AI MUST ATTENTION ask user whether to skip.

> **External Memory:** Complex/lengthy work → write findings + results to `tmp/reports/` — prevents context loss.

> **Evidence Gate:** MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION — every claim requires `file:line` proof or traced evidence with confidence % (>80% act, <80% verify first).

## Mode protocols

The protocols below apply to this mode only; their full text is inline so this reference is self-contained. The `plan` skill already carries `core-engineering-principles`, `cross-service-check` and `plan-quality`.

<!-- SYNC:nested-task-creation -->

> **Nested Task Expansion Contract** — For workflow-step invocation, the `[Workflow] ...` row is only a parent container; the child skill still creates visible phase tasks.
>
> 1. Call the current task list first. Set `nested=true` and record `parentTaskId` ONLY when this run created its own child phase tasks linked to that parent row; a `[Workflow]` row that merely exists in the current task list (stale, abandoned, or belonging to another run) does not make a run nested — such a run behaves as standalone.
> 2. Create one task per declared phase before phase work. When nested, prefix subjects `[N.M] /skill-name — phase`.
> 3. When nested, link the parent with `TaskUpdate(parentTaskId, addBlockedBy: [childIds])`.
> 4. Orchestrators must pre-expand a child skill's phase list and link the workflow row before invoking that child skill or sub-agent.
> 5. Mark exactly one child `in_progress` before work and `completed` immediately after evidence is written.
> 6. Complete the parent only after all child tasks are completed or explicitly cancelled with reason.
>
> **Blocked until:** the current task list done, child phases created, parent linked when nested, first child marked `in_progress`.

<!-- /SYNC:nested-task-creation -->

<!-- SYNC:sequential-thinking-protocol -->

> **Sequential Thinking Protocol** — Structured multi-step reasoning for complex/ambiguous work. Use when planning, reviewing, debugging, or refining ideas where one-shot reasoning is unsafe.
>
> **Trigger when:** complex problem decomposition · adaptive plans needing revision · analysis with course correction · unclear/emerging scope · multi-step solutions · hypothesis-driven debugging · cross-cutting trade-off evaluation.
>
> **Format (explicit mode — visible thought trail):**
>
> 1. `Thought N/M: [aspect]` — one aspect per thought, state assumptions/uncertainty
> 2. `Thought N/M [REVISION of Thought K]: ...` — when prior reasoning invalidated; state Original / Why revised / Impact
> 3. `Thought N/M [BRANCH A from Thought K]: ...` — explore alternative; converge with decision rationale
> 4. `Thought N/M [HYPOTHESIS]: ...` then `[VERIFICATION]: ...` — test before acting
> 5. `Thought N/N [FINAL]` — only when verified, all critical aspects addressed, confidence >80%
>
> **Mandatory closers:** Confidence % stated · Assumptions listed · Open questions surfaced · Next action concrete.
>
> **Stop conditions:** confidence <60% on any critical decision → stop and escalate by asking the user directly (60-80% → verify first) · ≥3 revisions on same thought → re-frame the problem · branch count >3 → split into sub-task.
>
> **Implicit mode:** apply methodology internally without visible markers when adding markers would clutter the response (routine work where reasoning aids accuracy).

<!-- /SYNC:sequential-thinking-protocol -->

<!-- SYNC:task-tracking-external-report -->

> **Task Tracking & External Report Persistence** — Bootstrap this before execution; then run project-reference doc prefetch before target/source work.
>
> 1. Create a small task breakdown before target file reads, grep, edits, or analysis. On context loss, inspect the current task list first.
> 2. Mark one task `in_progress` before work and `completed` immediately after evidence; never batch transitions.
> 3. For plan/review work, create `tmp/reports/{skill}-{YYMMDD}-{HHmm}-{slug}.md` before first finding.
> 4. Append findings after each file/section/decision and synthesize from the report file at the end.
> 5. Final output cites `Full report: tmp/reports/{filename}`.
>
> **Blocked until:** task breakdown exists, report path declared for plan/review work, first finding persisted before the next finding.

<!-- /SYNC:task-tracking-external-report -->

<!-- SYNC:understand-code-first -->

> **Understand Existing Code First** — For code changes, read and trace the target before planning or editing; do not apply a code workflow to work with no code surface.
>
> 1. Search for relevant existing implementations and cite `file:line`; aim for 3+ comparable examples when they exist, and record when the project has fewer or none.
> 2. Read the target area and its configured project references; identify actual structure, owners, and conventions without assuming a framework, layer model, or base class.
> 3. Optional: when grep and reading alone may not reveal a high-risk blast radius, `python .claude/scripts/code_graph trace <file> --direction both --json` (when `.code-graph/graph.db` exists) can add callers and dependents — a hint that may be stale, verified by reading the files.
> 4. Map affected dependencies and callers with available repository tools (grep, reading); an absent, stale or unsupported graph never blocks or fails the task.
> 5. Write investigation to `tmp/analysis/` for non-trivial tasks (3+ files).
> 6. Re-read the analysis before implementing; update it when evidence changes.
> 7. Follow a fitting local pattern, or state why no suitable pattern exists and justify a project-appropriate choice.
>
> **BLOCKED until:** target and relevant existing patterns are inspected, applicable dependencies are traced, and material assumptions have evidence. If an item does not apply or the repository has no comparable implementation, record that fact rather than fabricating a gate result.

<!-- /SYNC:understand-code-first -->

<!-- SYNC:understand-code-first:reminder -->

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** search 3+ existing patterns and read code/conventions BEFORE any modification or explanation. The code graph is optional advice for high-risk blast radius (a hint that may be stale), never a requirement.

<!-- /SYNC:understand-code-first:reminder -->

<!-- SYNC:evidence-based-reasoning:reminder -->

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** cite `file:line` evidence for every claim; never speculate. Confidence >80% to act, <60% = do NOT recommend; "not enough evidence" is valid output.

<!-- /SYNC:evidence-based-reasoning:reminder -->

<!-- SYNC:plan-quality:reminder -->

**MUST ATTENTION** Plan at decision-and-boundary altitude: resolve `specArtifacts`; map behavior to existing or planned test owners without fabricating future evidence; name bounded executor discovery; author tests with implementation; run suites only at the final verify gate after all implementation and static review; list a task-specific quality-gates checklist (gate · applies · verification · evidence · owner phase) before the phases.

## Prompt-Enhance Closing Anchors

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** follow declared step order for this mode; NEVER skip, reorder, or merge steps without explicit user approval
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** for every step/sub-skill call: set `in_progress` before execution, set `completed` after execution
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** every skipped step MUST include explicit reason; every completed step MUST include concise evidence
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** if Task tools unavailable, maintain an equivalent step-by-step plan tracker with synchronized statuses

## Closing Reminders

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION Goal:** Force every assumption-laden plan decision and every preservation-critical behavior through explicit user confirmation BEFORE implementation — by interviewing the user with critical questions that validate assumptions and surface issues — so no unstated assumption silently reaches code.

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION Main steps:** detect plan type → resolve the plan and applicability gate → read plan/phase files → extract decision topics → ask bounded user questions → document confirmed answers → offer implement/refine/skip.

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION Applicability:** validate the embedded decomposition/slice evidence, explicit roadmap milestone chain, framework technical evidence, or EXEMPT reason/owner plus non-goals, definitions, scenario proof where applicable, skeleton/commands, redacted evidence, and human approval before offering implementation; unresolved intent or evidence is BLOCKED.

**Protocols in force (concise digest of the SYNC/shared blocks this mode carries):**

- **Nested Task Creation:** child skill still creates visible phase tasks; link parent when nested.
- **Task Tracking & External Report:** bootstrap task breakdown first; persist findings incrementally to `tmp/reports/`.
- **Sequential Thinking:** structured multi-step Thought N/M with REVISION/BRANCH/HYPOTHESIS markers and confidence closer.
- **Understand Code First:** MUST ATTENTION read code and grep 3+ patterns before any modification.
- **Plan Quality:** include `## Test Specifications` with TC-{FEATURE}-{NNN} IDs per phase.
- **Cross-Service Check:** scan producers, consumers, sagas, contracts; flag breaking-change risk.

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** run the main steps IN ORDER — Phase 0 Detect Plan Type → resolve plan path → load `mode` + `questions` range → Phase 0.5 Product Readiness / Plan Gate → Step 1 Read `plan.md` + all `phase-*.md` (flag decisions/assumptions/risks/tradeoffs) → Step 2 Extract topics (9 categories) → Step 3 Generate questions (2-4 options each) → Step 4 Interview by asking the user directly (≤4 per call) → Step 5 Document answers → offer implement/refine/skip — why: the pipeline IS the work; never collapse or skip a step from memory

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** validate decisions with the user by asking the user directly — NEVER auto-decide or self-answer; completing without ≥1 question is a protocol violation — why: the user owns every assumption-laden choice, not the agent
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** detect plan type FIRST (Phase 0) BEFORE generating questions — bugfix keywords (fix, bug, regression, broken, defect) make the Preservation question BLOCKING, never skipped — why: detection drives which categories fire and the Preservation gate
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** NEVER modify phase files — persist results by adding ONLY a `## Validation Summary` (confirmed decisions + action items) to `plan.md` — why: phase files are the plan's source of truth and validation is a read-then-annotate pass

- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** break work into small todo tasks using task tracking BEFORE starting (including a task per file read); call the current task list first on context loss, never duplicate — why: resume existing tasks rather than re-plan after compaction
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** honor the `questions` MIN-MAX range and `mode` from `## Plan Context` as hard constraints; give 2-4 concrete options per question, never go below min — why: the interview budget is configured, not improvised
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** treat the Preservation "Unsure" answer as BLOCKED → return BLOCKED status and route to `$plan` preservation analysis before any implementation — why: an unverified preserved-correctness invariant is a silent regression risk
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** if the plan introduces new tech/packages, probe whether alternatives were evaluated before accepting the choice — why: unevaluated dependency choices raise future change cost
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** cite `file:line` proof or traced evidence with confidence % for every claim (>80% act, <80% verify first); admit uncertainty rather than present a guess as fact — why: speculation drives wrong validation questions
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** search 3+ existing patterns and read the plan + phase files BEFORE generating questions — match the codebase's local conventions over generic framework defaults — why: questions grounded in actual code surface real decisions, not invented ones
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** apply the Easy-to-Change lens before any rule below — flag decisions that raise future change cost (coupling, hidden state, duplicated knowledge, unclear intent, irreversible early choices)
- **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** add a final review task to verify work quality

**Anti-Rationalization:**

| Evasion                            | Rebuttal                                                            |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "Plan is simple, skip validation"  | Simple plans still have implicit decisions. Apply anyway.           |
| "Already know the answers"         | Show user responses as proof. No responses = no validation.         |
| "Preservation doesn't apply here"  | If title has fix/bug/regression/broken/defect → ALWAYS applies.     |
| "Phase 0 not needed"               | Detection drives the Preservation gate. NEVER skip.                 |
| "Only ask a few questions"         | Use the `questions` range from Plan Context. Never go below min.    |
| "I'll just answer for the user"    | ask the user directly is mandatory. Self-answer = no validation.        |
| "New library is obviously fine"    | Probe whether alternatives were evaluated before accepting it.      |
| "I'll edit the phase files inline" | NEVER. Add only a `## Validation Summary` to `plan.md`.             |

**[TASK-PLANNING]** Before acting, analyze task scope and systematically break it into small todo tasks and sub-tasks using task tracking.

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** detect plan type (Phase 0) FIRST — bugfix keywords make Preservation BLOCKING.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** validate with the user by asking the user directly — NEVER auto-decide.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** NEVER modify phase files — add only a `## Validation Summary` to `plan.md`.

<!-- SYNC:core-engineering-principles:reminder -->

**MUST ATTENTION** Core Engineering Principles — every plan, implementation and review must be **Easy to change** (reuse first, one owner per rule, interfaces/adapters at volatile boundaries, no speculative abstraction) · **Easy to scale** (extend by addition, bounded growth, explicit boundaries, sized to the project's real profile) · **Easy to maintain** (intent-named tests that fail when the rule breaks across happy/error/edge paths; harness green locally and in CI). Before done: next change → how many edit sites? 10× → what breaks? which test goes red?
