## Codex Project-Reference Loading (No Hooks)

Codex does not receive Claude hook-based doc injection.
When coding, planning, debugging, testing, or reviewing, open project docs explicitly using this routing.

**Always read:**
- `docs/project-reference/docs-index-reference.md` (routes to the full `docs/project-reference/*` catalog)
- `docs/project-reference/lessons.md` (always-on guardrails and anti-patterns)

**Situation-based docs:**
- Backend/CQRS/API/domain/entity changes: `backend-patterns-reference.md`, `domain-entities-reference.md`, `project-structure-reference.md`
- Frontend/UI/styling/design-system: `frontend-patterns-reference.md`, `scss-styling-guide.md`, `design-system/README.md`
- Spec/test-case planning or TC mapping: `feature-docs-reference.md`
- Integration test implementation/review: `integration-test-reference.md`
- E2E test implementation/review: `e2e-test-reference.md`
- Code review/audit work: `code-review-rules.md` plus domain docs above based on changed files

Do not read all docs blindly. Start from `docs-index-reference.md`, then open only relevant files for the task.

## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Intelligently create implementation plans by analyzing task complexity and routing to `$plan-fast` or `$plan-hard`.

**Workflow:**

1. **Analyze** — Surface ambiguity BEFORE planning (protocol below), then ask clarifying questions via a direct user question.
2. **Route** — Decide `$plan-fast` (simple) or `$plan-hard` (complex) based on scope
3. **Create** — Execute chosen plan variant, write plan to `plans/` directory
4. **Validate** — Offer `$plan-review` and `$plan-validate` for quality assurance

> **Ambiguity Protocol — MUST ATTENTION run before writing any plan:**
>
> | Dimension       | Ask                                                                          |
> | --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
> | **Scope**       | All records or filtered? What's included/excluded? Any privacy implications? |
> | **Format**      | File? API? Background job? UI change? What does "done" look like?            |
> | **Volume**      | How many entities/files affected? (drives approach: in-memory vs paged)      |
> | **Constraints** | Performance targets? Security boundaries? Patterns already in use?           |
>
> If multiple interpretations exist, present with effort estimates before planning:
>
> ```
> "[Request]" could mean:
> 1. [Interpretation A] — [approach] — ~[Nh] effort
> 2. [Interpretation B] — [approach] — ~[Nh] effort
> Simplest approach: [X]. Which direction?
> ```
>
> NEVER pick silently. If a simpler approach exists than implied, say so first.

**Key Rules:**

- PLANNING-ONLY: never implement, never use manual plan-mode switching tool
- Parent skill for all plan-\* variants (plan-fast, plan-hard, plan-ci, plan-cro, plan-two, plan-parallel)
- Always collaborate with user; ask decision questions, present options
- Always add final `$plan-validate` and `$plan-review` tasks

## Greenfield Mode

> **Auto-detected:** If no existing codebase is found (no code directories like `src/`, `app/`, `lib/`, `server/`, `packages/`, etc., no manifest files like `package.json`/`*.sln`/`go.mod`, no populated `project-config.json`), this skill switches to greenfield mode automatically. Planning artifacts (docs/, plans/, .claude/) don't count — the project must have actual code directories with content.

**When greenfield is detected:**

1. **ALWAYS route to `$plan-hard`** — greenfield planning requires deep research, never fast plans
2. Skip reading project reference docs (they won't exist in a greenfield project)
3. Enable web research for tech landscape analysis (WebSearch + WebFetch)
4. Delegate architecture decisions to `solution-architect` agent
5. Increase user interview frequency (ask the user directly at each major decision)
6. If `$greenfield` workflow is not already active, suggest it via ask the user directly:
    - "Activate Greenfield Project Init workflow (Recommended)" — full waterfall inception
    - "Continue with standalone $plan-hard" — planning only, no full workflow

## Variant Decision Guide

| If the task is...                | Use                  | Why                                    |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Simple, clear scope (<5 files)   | `$plan-fast`         | Lightweight plan, faster output        |
| Complex, multi-layer, many files | `$plan-hard`         | Deep research, comprehensive plan      |
| CI/CD pipeline changes           | `$plan-ci`           | CI-specific context and validation     |
| Cross-cutting refactor           | `$plan-cro`          | Cross-service impact analysis          |
| Parallel implementation possible | `$plan-parallel`     | Splits plan into parallelizable phases |
| Two competing approaches         | `$plan-two`          | Creates 2 plans for comparison         |
| Analyzing existing plan          | `$plan-analysis`     | Reviews/critiques an existing plan     |
| Archiving completed plan         | `$plan-archive`      | Moves plan to archive                  |
| General/unknown                  | `$plan-hard` (this skill) | Routes automatically                   |

## PLANNING-ONLY — Collaboration Required

> **DO NOT** use the manual plan-mode switching tool — you are ALREADY in a planning workflow.
> **DO NOT** implement or execute any code changes.
> **COLLABORATE** with the user: ask decision questions, present options with recommendations.
> After plan creation, ALWAYS use a direct user question tool to offer `$plan-review` validation.
> ASK user to confirm the plan before any next step.

## Your mission

<task>
$ARGUMENTS
</task>

## Pre-Creation Check (Active vs Suggested Plan Detection)

Check the `## Plan Context` section in the injected context:

- If "Plan:" shows a path → Active plan exists. Ask user: "Active plan found: {path}. Continue with this? [Y/n]"
- If "Suggested:" shows a path → Branch-matched plan hint only. Ask user if they want to activate it or create new.
- If "Plan: none" → Proceed to create new plan using naming pattern from `## Naming` section.

## Workflow

- Analyze the given task and use a direct user question tool to ask for more details if needed.
- Decide to use `$plan-fast` or `$plan-hard` SlashCommands based on the complexity.
- Execute SlashCommand: `$plan-fast <detailed-instructions-prompt>` or `$plan-hard <detailed-instructions-prompt>`
- Activate `planning` skill.
- Note: `detailed-instructions-prompt` is **an enhanced prompt** that describes the task in detail based on the provided task description.

**MANDATORY FINAL TASKS** — After all planning tasks, ALWAYS add these final tasks:

1. **"Write test specifications for each phase"** — Add `## Test Specifications` with TC-{FEAT}-{NNN} IDs to every phase file. Use `$tdd-spec` if feature docs exist. `Evidence: TBD` for TDD-first mode.
2. **"Run $plan-validate"** — Interview user to validate plan assumptions
3. **"Run $plan-review"** — Auto-review plan for validity and best practices
4. **"Run $why-review (standalone only)"** — If NOT inside a workflow, trigger `$why-review` to validate design rationale, alternatives considered, and risk assessment in the plan. Skip if a workflow already includes `$why-review` in its sequence.

---

## Standalone Review Gate (Non-Workflow Only)

> **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION:** If this skill is called **outside a workflow** (standalone `$plan-hard`), the generated plan MUST ATTENTION include `$review-changes` as a **final phase/task** in the plan. This ensures all implementation changes get reviewed before commit even without a workflow enforcing it.
>
> If already running inside a workflow (e.g., `feature`, `bugfix`), skip this — the workflow sequence handles `$review-changes` at the appropriate step.

## Workflow Recommendation

> **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION — NO EXCEPTIONS:** If you are NOT already in a workflow, you MUST ATTENTION use a direct user question to ask the user. Do NOT judge task complexity or decide this is "simple enough to skip" — the user decides whether to use a workflow, not you:
>
> 1. **Activate `pre-development` workflow** (Recommended) — quality-gate → plan → plan-review → plan-validate
> 2. **Execute `$plan-hard` directly** — run this skill standalone

---

## Post-Plan Granularity Self-Check (MANDATORY)

<!-- SYNC:plan-granularity -->

> **Plan Granularity** — Every phase must pass 5-point check before implementation:
>
> 1. Lists exact file paths to modify (not generic "implement X")
> 2. No planning verbs (research, investigate, analyze, determine, figure out)
> 3. Steps ≤30min each, phase total ≤3h
> 4. ≤5 files per phase
> 5. No open decisions or TBDs in approach
>
> **Failing phases →** create sub-plan. Repeat until ALL leaf phases pass (max depth: 3).
> **Self-question:** "Can I start coding RIGHT NOW? If any step needs 'figuring out' → sub-plan it."

<!-- /SYNC:plan-granularity -->

## Preservation Inventory (MANDATORY for bugfixes)

<!-- SYNC:preservation-inventory -->

> **Preservation Inventory** — MANDATORY for bugfix plans. Trigger keywords in plan title/frontmatter: `fix`, `bug`, `regression`, `broken`, `defect`. Author MUST produce this table BEFORE writing implementation steps.
>
> **Columns:** `Invariant | file:line | Why (data consequence if broken) | Verification (TC-ID or grep)`
>
> **BLOCKED until:** ≥3 rows · every File cell has `file:line` · every Verification cell has TC-ID or grep (not "manually verify")

<!-- /SYNC:preservation-inventory -->

After creating all phase files, run the **recursive decomposition loop**:

1. Score each phase against the 5-point criteria (file paths, no planning verbs, ≤30min steps, ≤5 files, no open decisions)
2. For each FAILING phase → create task to decompose it into a sub-plan (with its own $plan-hard → $plan-review → $plan-validate → fix cycle)
3. Re-score new phases. Repeat until ALL leaf phases pass (max depth: 3)
4. **Self-question:** "For each phase, can I start coding RIGHT NOW? If any needs 'figuring out' → sub-plan it."

## Next Steps (Standalone: MUST ATTENTION ask user via a direct user question. Skip if inside workflow.)

> **MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION — NO EXCEPTIONS:** If this skill was called **outside a workflow**, you MUST ATTENTION use a direct user question to present these options. Do NOT skip because the task seems "simple" or "obvious" — the user decides:

- **"Proceed with full workflow (Recommended)"** — I'll detect the best workflow to continue from here (plan created). This ensures review, validation, implementation, and testing steps aren't skipped.
- **"$why-review"** — Validate design rationale in the plan before implementation (standalone only — skipped when workflow includes it)
- **"$plan-review"** — Auto-review plan for validity and best practices
- **"$plan-validate"** — Interview user to confirm plan decisions
- **"Skip, continue manually"** — user decides

> If already inside a workflow, skip — the workflow handles sequencing.

4. **ACTIVATE (if confirmed):** Call `$workflow-start <workflowId>` for standard; sequence custom steps manually
5. **CREATE TASKS:** task tracking for ALL workflow steps
6. **EXECUTE:** Follow each step in sequence
**[CRITICAL-THINKING-MINDSET]** Apply critical thinking, sequential thinking. Every claim needs traced proof, confidence >80% to act.
**Anti-hallucination principle:** Never present guess as fact — cite sources for every claim, admit uncertainty freely, self-check output for errors, cross-reference independently, stay skeptical of own confidence — certainty without evidence root of all hallucination.
**AI Attention principle (Primacy-Recency):** Put the 3 most critical rules at both top and bottom of long prompts/protocols so instruction adherence survives long context windows.
## Learned Lessons

# Lessons

<!-- This file is referenced by Claude skills and agents for project-specific context. -->
<!-- Fill in your project's details below. -->

- [2026-03-10] **Mirror copies create staleness traps.** Editing a canonical source is insufficient when mirror copies exist — must trace and update ALL mirrored files (configs, skill definitions, docs). Grep verification after edits catches missed mirrors.
- [2026-03-10] **Docs embedding derived data stale on source modification.** Documentation that inlines data from a canonical source (e.g., workflow sequences, API schemas) goes stale silently when the source changes. Map all docs that embed canonical data and update them alongside the source.
- [2026-04-14] **Front-load report-write in sub-agent prompts for large reviews.** Sub-agents reviewing many files exhaust token budget before writing the final report — all findings lost. Design prompts so: (1) report-write is the explicit first deliverable, (2) findings appended per-file immediately (not batched), (3) scope is bounded. If sub-agent returns truncated output with no report, spawn a new one with narrower scope.
- [2026-04-14] **After context compaction, re-verify all prior phase outcomes before continuing.** Session summaries describe what the AI intended — not what persisted in the environment. When resuming a multi-phase task, the first action must be a state audit: re-check git status, re-read files, verify filesystem state. Treat every "completed" phase claim as an untested hypothesis.
## [LESSON-LEARNED-REMINDER] [BLOCKING] Task Planning & Continuous Improvement — MANDATORY. Do not skip.

Break work into small tasks (task tracking) before starting. Add final task: "Analyze AI mistakes & lessons learned".

**Extract lessons — ROOT CAUSE ONLY, not symptom fixes:**
1. Name the FAILURE MODE (reasoning/assumption failure), not symptom — "assumed API existed without reading source" not "used wrong enum value".
2. Generality test: does this failure mode apply to ≥3 contexts/codebases? If not, abstract one level up.
3. Write as a universal rule — strip project-specific names/paths/classes. Useful on any codebase.
4. Consolidate: multiple mistakes sharing one failure mode → ONE lesson.
5. **Recurrence gate:** "Would this recur in future session WITHOUT this reminder?" — No → skip `$learn`.
6. **Auto-fix gate:** "Could `$code-review`/`/simplify`/`$security`/`$lint` catch this?" — Yes → improve review skill instead.
7. BOTH gates pass → ask user to run `$learn`.
**[TASK-PLANNING] [MANDATORY]** BEFORE executing any workflow or skill step, create/update task tracking for all planned steps, then keep it synchronized as each step starts/completes.
