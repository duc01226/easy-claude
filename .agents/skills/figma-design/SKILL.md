## Codex Project-Reference Loading (No Hooks)

Codex uses static project-reference loading instead of runtime-injected project docs.
When coding, planning, debugging, testing, or reviewing, open project docs explicitly using this routing.

**Always read:**
- `docs/project-config.json` (project-specific paths, commands, modules, and workflow/test settings)
- `docs/project-reference/docs-index-reference.md` (routes to the full `docs/project-reference/*` catalog)
- `docs/project-reference/lessons.md` (always-on guardrails and anti-patterns)

**Missing/stale context route:** If `docs/project-config.json`, the docs index, `lessons.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, or any task-required reference doc is missing or stale, auto-run `$project-init` or the narrow setup route (`$project-config`, `$docs-init`, `$scan-all`, `$scan --target=<key>`, `$claude-md-init`) before ordinary project-specific work. If Codex mirrors or `AGENTS.md` are missing/stale, ask the user to run `$sync-codex`; do not auto-run it.

**Situation-based docs:**
- Project structure/architecture/tech-stack/deployment/setup (any layer — backend, frontend, or infra): `project-structure-reference.md`
- Backend/CQRS/API/domain/entity changes: `backend-patterns-reference.md`, `domain-entities-reference.md`
- Frontend/UI/styling/design-system: `frontend-patterns-reference.md`, `scss-styling-guide.md`, `design-system/README.md`
- Spec authoring, `docs/specs/` pathing, or TC format: `feature-spec-reference.md`, `spec-system-reference.md`, `spec-principles.md`
- Behavior/public-contract changes or spec-test-code sync: `workflow-spec-test-code-cycle-reference.md` plus the spec docs above
- Derived spec indexes/ERDs/reimplementation guides: `spec-system-reference.md` and source Feature Specs under `docs/specs/`
- Integration test implementation/review: `integration-test-reference.md`
- E2E test implementation/review: `e2e-test-reference.md`
- Code review/audit work: `code-review-rules.md` plus domain docs above based on changed files

Do not read all docs blindly. Start from `docs-index-reference.md`, then open only relevant files for the task.

## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Extract structured design context from Figma designs for downstream use by `design-spec` and planning skills.

**Workflow:**

1. **Detect Input** — Parse Figma URL, extract file key + node ID
2. **Select Extraction Method** — 4-level fallback chain
3. **Extract Context** — Design tokens, components, layout, typography
4. **Output Artifact** — Structured markdown for design-spec consumption

**Key Rules:**

### Frontend/UI Context (if applicable)

> When this task involves frontend or UI changes,

- Component patterns: `docs/project-reference/frontend-patterns-reference.md`
- Styling/BEM guide: `docs/project-reference/scss-styling-guide.md`
- Design system tokens: `docs/project-reference/design-system/README.md`

- Always try highest-fidelity method first, fallback gracefully
- Output must be consumable by `design-spec` and `ui-wireframe-protocol`
- Keep extraction under 5K tokens per design

## Extraction Fallback Chain

> **[BLOCKING] Before the extracted design feeds a new/updated screen** (per the `SYNC:existing-ui-research` protocol carried by this skill): inventory the existing related UI and map connected feature flows so the design built from this extract faithfully matches the current UI system. Skip only when the extract is not driving a new/updated screen (state it explicitly).

### Level 1: Official Figma MCP (Best Fidelity)

Check if MCP tools available: look for `get_design_context` in tool list.

If available:

1. `get_design_context` — structured layout, components, tokens, constraints
2. `get_screenshot` — visual reference image
3. `get_code_connect_map` — map Figma components to code components

### Level 2: GLips Figma-Context-MCP (Good Fidelity)

Check if GLips MCP tools available (look for figma-context tools).

If available:

1. Extract file metadata, frame structure, component list
2. Limited to read-only operations

### Level 3: Figma REST API (Manual)

If `FIGMA_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variable exists:

1. Call `GET /v1/files/{file_key}/nodes?ids={node_id}` via bash script
2. Parse response for: component names, styles, layout properties
3. Limited — no screenshot, no Code Connect

### Level 4: Screenshot + visual analysis tooling (Always Available)

If no MCP and no API token:

1. Ask user by asking the user directly: "Please screenshot the Figma frame and paste here"
2. Analyze via `visual analysis tooling` skill with design extraction prompts
3. Extract: approximate colors, fonts, spacing, layout, components

## Figma URL Detection & MCP Extraction (canonical)

> Applies when reading PBI/design-spec files that reference Figma URLs. URL→MCP extraction runs inline in this skill.

When a PBI or design-spec references one or more Figma URLs, parse each URL and extract:

- **File Key** — the `[a-zA-Z0-9]+` segment after `figma.com/design/` or `figma.com/file/`.
- **Node ID** — the `node-id=NNN-NNN` query param (display form, e.g. `1-23`). API form replaces `-` with `:` → `1:23`.

Then extract the referenced nodes via the available Figma MCP tools:

```
# With a node id (preferred — narrow, cheap):
mcp__figma__get_file_nodes file_key="{fileKey}" node_ids="{apiNodeId}"

# Whole file (no node id):
mcp__figma__get_file file_key="{fileKey}"
```

**Token Budget:** extract specific nodes only — target <5K tokens per design. Never pull a whole file when a node id is available.

## Output Format

Save to `team-artifacts/design-specs/{YYMMDD}-figma-extract-{slug}.md`:

```markdown
# Figma Design Extract: {Name}

**Source:** {Figma URL}
**Method:** {MCP Level 1 | MCP Level 2 | REST API | Screenshot}
**Date:** {YYMMDD}

## Design Tokens

| Category   | Token     | Value                |
| ---------- | --------- | -------------------- |
| Color      | Primary   | {hex}                |
| Color      | Secondary | {hex}                |
| Typography | Heading   | {font, size, weight} |
| Spacing    | Base      | {px}                 |

## Component Inventory

- **{ComponentName}** — {description}, variants: {list}

## Layout

{ASCII wireframe per ui-wireframe-protocol}

## Responsive

{Breakpoint behavior if detectable}

{Small-screen minimum bar: the layout must stay usable on mobile — preferred reflow (flex-wrap / row → column, grids collapse to one column); acceptable fallback when a component genuinely can't reflow (tables, canvases, wide grids) is a min-width/min-height + overflow:auto scroll (scrolling is OK); hard requirement is nothing broken — no clipped, cut-off, or unreachable content. Note any component that would need a large redesign to work on mobile so the user can confirm scope.}

## Clause Conformance (UI/UX Design Principles)

| Clause | Observed in the Figma source | Verdict | Note |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `UI-2.5` type scale | {distinct text sizes found} | PASS / DRIFT | {collapses to 6 named steps, or list the one-off sizes} |
| `UI-2.2` body size | {px} | PASS / FAIL | {16px web / 17px mobile; anything below 14px is a hard fail} |
| `UI-3.1` contrast | {measured ratios per pair} | PASS / FAIL | {4.5:1 text, 3:1 UI edges — computed from the extracted hexes} |
| `UI-3.3` colour alone | {status/meaning carriers} | PASS / FAIL | {icon or label paired with the colour?} |
| `UI-4.1` spacing unit | {values found} | PASS / DRIFT | {one 4px or 8px base, every gap a multiple; list off-grid values + nodes} |
| `UI-5.2` interaction states | {variants present} | PASS / GAP | {default, hover, focus, active, disabled — name the missing ones} |
| `UI-1.5` empty/loading/error | {frames present} | PASS / GAP | {name which of the three are missing} |
| `UI-8.1` touch targets | {sizes on mobile frames} | PASS / FAIL | {≥44×44pt, 8px apart — mobile/touch frames only} |
```

## Clause Conformance Read (extraction gate)

Figma is a SOURCE, not an authority. Extract the design context AND read it against the 40 UI/UX Design Principles (`UI-1.1`–`UI-9.4`, the `SYNC:ui-ux-design-principles` block below) — an extract that silently imports a violation propagates it into every downstream spec, mock-up, and implementation.

1. **Measure, never eyeball (`UI-3.1`).** Compute contrast from the extracted hex pairs — 4.5:1 text, 3:1 UI edges — and record the NUMBER. A Figma colour style that fails is REPORTED as a failure, never imported as a token without the flag.
2. **Check the type scale for drift (`UI-2.5`, `UI-2.2`, `UI-2.3`).** Collapse the extracted text styles to 6 named steps; more than 6, or one-off sizes, is scale drift — list the offending sizes. Flag body below 16px web / 17px mobile, and anything under 14px as a hard fail; note where the measure exceeds 45–75 characters.
3. **Check the spacing unit (`UI-4.1`).** Reduce the extracted spacing values to ONE 4px or 8px base; every value that is not a multiple is recorded as off-grid with its source node.
4. **Check state coverage (`UI-5.2`, `UI-1.5`, `UI-9.3`).** Figma files usually ship the populated state only. Name which of the empty / loading / error frames are MISSING, and which of the 5 interaction states (default, hover, focus, active, disabled) have no variant — those gaps become open questions for the design owner, never silent omissions downstream. Note anything that loads without reserved space.
5. **Check touch surfaces (`UI-8.1`, `UI-8.2`).** On mobile/touch frames, verify hit targets ≥44×44pt spaced 8px apart and primary actions in the bottom third; report undersized targets with their node names.

Record every result in the `## Clause Conformance` table of the output above. Project design-system docs OUTRANK the clauses, and the clauses outrank the Figma file — when the three disagree, surface all sides to the user; NEVER resolve it silently.

## When to Use

- Figma URL detected in PBI, design-spec, or user prompt
- Called by `design-spec` when Figma URL is present
- Called by `plan` skill during Design Context Extraction step

## When NOT to Use

- No Figma URL present — skip, proceed to `design-spec` directly
- Hand-drawn wireframe — use `design-spec --mode=wireframe` instead
- Screenshot of existing app — use `design --mode=screenshot` instead

## See Also

<!-- SYNC:existing-ui-research -->

> **[BLOCKING] Understand the existing UI before you design or spec a new/updated screen.** Before producing any wireframe, mockup, screen design, or UI spec:
>
> 1. **Inventory existing related UI** — search the project for screens, pages, and components already serving this feature or its domain (consult design-system docs + the real component inventory).
> 2. **Map connected flows** — identify every feature that links to, embeds, includes, or navigates to/from the new screen; trace its entry and exit flows so the new screen fits them.
> 3. **Reuse before invent** — prefer existing components, patterns, and layout conventions; justify any new component against what already exists.
> 4. **Record findings** — note the matched existing screens/components + connected flows in the artifact so downstream design faithfully matches the current UI system.

>
> **1.0 Visual Hierarchy & Layout**
>
> - `UI-1.1` One focal point per screen. Two elements competing for first read → demote one.
> - `UI-1.2` Signal order: size → weight → colour → position. Use the cheapest signal that works before adding another.
> - `UI-1.3` Group by proximity, NEVER by border. Whitespace separates cleanly; boxes inside boxes do not.
> - `UI-1.4` Align to a shared edge. Every unexplained indent reads as an accident.
> - `UI-1.5` Design the empty, loading and error state FIRST. The full state is the easy one.
>
> **2.0 Typography**
>
> - `UI-2.1` Max 2 families, 3 weights each. More variety reads as inconsistency, not range.
> - `UI-2.2` Body text 16px web, 17px mobile. NEVER below 14px for anything a user must read.
> - `UI-2.3` Line length 45–75 characters. Constrain the measure, not the container.
> - `UI-2.4` Leading scales inversely with size: 1.5 body, 1.1–1.2 display.
> - `UI-2.5` Fixed type scale — 6 named steps shared with engineering. NEVER one-off sizes.
>
> **3.0 Colour & Contrast**
>
> - `UI-3.1` Contrast 4.5:1 text, 3:1 UI edges. Measure it — NEVER judge by eye on a bright screen.
> - `UI-3.2` One accent, one job. An accent that is everywhere points at nothing.
> - `UI-3.3` Colour NEVER carries meaning alone — pair it with an icon, label or position.
> - `UI-3.4` Dark mode is NOT inverted light mode. Lift surfaces to signal elevation; soften pure-white text.
>
> **4.0 Spacing & Grid**
>
> - `UI-4.1` One spacing unit, multiplied — 4px or 8px base; every gap a multiple of it.
> - `UI-4.2` Space belongs to the container, not the child. Use `gap`; reserve margins for exceptions.
> - `UI-4.3` Tighter inside, looser between — inner padding always smaller than the gap to the next group.
> - `UI-4.4` Breakpoints follow content, not devices. Break where the layout stops working.
>
> **5.0 Interaction & Feedback**
>
> - `UI-5.1` Every action gets a response under 100ms, even when the result takes longer.
> - `UI-5.2` Specify all 5 states — default, hover, focus, active, disabled — plus loading where it applies.
> - `UI-5.3` Prefer undo over confirmation. Confirm ONLY what cannot be reversed.
> - `UI-5.4` Motion clarifies cause and effect: 150–250ms, ease-out, honours reduced-motion.
> - `UI-5.5` Keep the visible focus ring. Restyle it if it clashes; NEVER remove it.
>
> **6.0 Navigation & IA**
>
> - `UI-6.1` Every screen answers: where am I, what's here, where next.
> - `UI-6.2` Max 5 top-level destinations. Depth beats a crowded first level.
> - `UI-6.3` Label by the user's word, not the internal one. Team vocabulary is not a taxonomy.
> - `UI-6.4` Every state deserves a URL or a back path. Deep links and hardware back must land somewhere sensible.
>
> **7.0 Forms & Input**
>
> - `UI-7.1` Ask for less. Every field needs a reason it exists today.
> - `UI-7.2` Labels stay visible. Placeholders are hints, NEVER labels.
> - `UI-7.3` Validate on blur, not on keystroke. Errors sit next to the field and say how to fix it.
> - `UI-7.4` Match keyboard to data type — correct input type, autocomplete and autocapitalise on every field.
> - `UI-7.5` NEVER lose entered data. Preserve input across errors, navigation and refresh.
>
> **8.0 Mobile & Touch** _(mobile/touch surfaces)_
>
> - `UI-8.1` Hit target ≥44×44pt, 8px apart. The target may exceed the visible icon.
> - `UI-8.2` Primary actions in the bottom third — that is where the thumb lives.
> - `UI-8.3` Gestures are shortcuts, NEVER the only route. Anything swipeable is also tappable.
> - `UI-8.4` Respect safe areas and the keyboard. Notch, home indicator and on-screen keyboard all steal space.
>
> **9.0 Speed & Perceived Speed**
>
> - `UI-9.1` Show structure before data — skeletons for known layouts, spinners only for unknown waits.
> - `UI-9.2` Assume success optimistically. Update UI first, reconcile after, roll back visibly on failure.
> - `UI-9.3` Reserve space for anything that loads. Images, ads and fonts must NEVER shift the layout.
> - `UI-9.4` Design for the slow connection. Offline, timeout and retry are states, NOT edge cases.
>

## Closing Reminders

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** break work into small todo tasks using task tracking BEFORE starting

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION — Protocols in force (concise digest of the SYNC/shared blocks this skill carries):**

- **UI System Context:** read frontend-patterns, scss-styling, design-system before any UI change.
- **Critical Thinking:** traced proof per claim, confidence >80% to act.
- **AI Mistake Prevention:** verify generated content against evidence, trace downstream references, verify all affected outputs, re-read after context loss, surface ambiguity.

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** search codebase for 3+ similar patterns before creating new code
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** cite `file:line` evidence for every claim (confidence >80% to act)
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** add a final review todo task to verify work quality
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** read the extract against the 40 UI/UX Design Principles (`UI-1.1`–`UI-9.4`) and REPORT violations in the `## Clause Conformance` table instead of importing them silently — contrast measured from the extracted hexes (4.5:1 text / 3:1 edges, `UI-3.1`), type-scale drift against 6 named steps (`UI-2.5`) and body 16px web / 17px mobile never below 14px (`UI-2.2`), off-grid values against ONE 4/8px unit (`UI-4.1`), MISSING empty/loading/error frames (`UI-1.5`) and missing variants of the 5 interaction states (`UI-5.2`), undersized touch targets (`UI-8.1`) and primaries outside the bottom third (`UI-8.2`) — project design-system docs outrank the clauses and the clauses outrank the Figma file; disagreements go to the user
**MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** READ the following files before starting:

**[TASK-PLANNING]** Before acting, analyze task scope and systematically break it into small todo tasks and sub-tasks using task tracking.

Source: `.claude/.ck.json` + `.claude/skills/shared/sync-inline-versions.md` (`:full` blocks) + `.claude/scripts/lib/hookless-prompt-protocol.cjs`

## [WORKFLOW-EXECUTION-PROTOCOL] [BLOCKING] Workflow Execution Protocol — MANDATORY IMPORTANT MUST CRITICAL. Do not skip for any reason.

**Generic portability boundary:** Reusable skills and protocol text stay project-neutral; project-specific conventions are discovered from docs/project-config.json and docs/project-reference/. Apply shared AI-SDD from `shared/sdd-artifact-contract.md`. Read `docs/project-config.json` and `docs/project-reference/docs-index-reference.md`, then open the project reference docs named there. For spec, test-case, behavior-change, public-contract, or `docs/specs/` work, route through the local spec docs named by the docs index: `feature-spec-reference.md`, `spec-system-reference.md`, `spec-principles.md`, and `workflow-spec-test-code-cycle-reference.md` when specs/tests/code must stay synchronized. If either file or a required reference doc is missing or stale, auto-run `$project-init` (or the narrow lower-level route such as `$project-config`, `$docs-init`, `$scan-all`, or `$scan --target=<key>`) before ordinary project-specific work. Any supported AI tool may execute when this shared context and local docs are available.

1. **DETECT:** If the prompt starts with an explicit slash skill/workflow command, execute it directly. Otherwise match the prompt against the workflow catalog and skill list.
2. **ANALYZE:** Choose the best option: execute directly, invoke a skill, activate a standard workflow, or compose a custom step combination.
3. **AUTO-SELECT:** Pick the best option yourself. Do not ask the user to choose between direct execution, skill, standard workflow, or custom workflow.
4. **ACTIVATE:** For a selected workflow, call `$start-workflow <workflowId>`; for a selected skill, invoke that skill; for a custom workflow, sequence custom steps directly; for direct execution, proceed with the task.
5. **CREATE TASKS:** task tracking for ALL workflow/skill/custom steps before execution when the selected path has multiple steps.
6. **PARALLELIZE:** Before executing the task list, tag each task `PAR` (independent inputs + write set disjoint from every other `PAR` task) or `SEQ` (name the blocking dependency), group `PAR` tasks into waves, declare the wave plan, and spawn each wave's sub-agents in ONE message — all-return barrier per wave, fan-out one level deep unless a sub-agent's own definition authorizes further fan-out. Sequential-by-default is a defect when tasks are independent; do not parallelize shared write targets, output-consuming tasks, trivial single-file work, ordering a skill or workflow explicitly fixes, or user-approval gates.
7. **EXECUTE:** Advance per the **Workflow Step Advancement & Parallel Phases** rule in your context instructions — model-driven; a sub-agent completion advances a step identically to an inline call; a parallel-phase group is an all-return barrier (advance only after ALL members return, never serialize it)

## SYNC:ai-sdd-artifact-contract

> **AI-SDD Artifact Contract** — Shared spec-driven development rules stay portable and source-owned.
>
> 1. Keep reusable AI-SDD principles in `.claude`; put repository-specific paths, commands, owners, products, and formats in project config/reference docs.
> 2. Preserve cycle: `spec -> plan -> tasks -> implement -> verify -> update spec/docs`.
> 3. Trace every requirement or invariant through decision, task, TC/test, source evidence, and docs/spec update.
> 4. Treat code-to-spec extraction as reference-only until accepted by the canonical spec owner.
> 5. Any supported AI tool may plan, implement, review, or verify with synced context; using multiple tools is optional.
> 6. Update `.claude` source first, then sync generated mirrors; do not manually edit `.agents`, `.codex`, or `AGENTS.md`. — why: mirrors are generated artifacts; hand-edits are overwritten on the next sync
> 7. If `docs/project-config.json`, root instruction files, or a required project-reference doc is missing or stale, auto-run `$project-init` or the narrow lower-level route before ordinary project-specific work.

## SYNC:ai-sdd-artifact-contract:reminder

- **MANDATORY** Apply `shared/sdd-artifact-contract.md`; keep reusable AI-SDD in `.claude` and local rules in project docs.
- **MANDATORY** Code-to-spec extraction is reference-only until canonical acceptance; any supported AI tool may execute with synced context.
- **MANDATORY** Update `.claude` source before syncing generated mirrors; do not manually edit `.agents`, `.codex`, or `AGENTS.md`.
- **MANDATORY** Missing or stale project config, root instruction files, or required reference docs route project-specific work through `$project-init` or the narrow setup route automatically.
**[TASK-PLANNING] [MANDATORY]** BEFORE executing any workflow or skill step, create/update task tracking for all planned steps, then keep it synchronized as each step starts/completes.
## [LESSON-LEARNED-REMINDER] [BLOCKING] Task Planning & Continuous Improvement — MANDATORY. Do not skip.

Break work into small tasks (task tracking) before starting. Add final task: "Analyze AI mistakes & lessons learned".

**Extract lessons — ROOT CAUSE ONLY, not symptom fixes:**
1. Name the FAILURE MODE (reasoning/assumption failure), not symptom — "assumed API existed without reading source" not "used wrong enum value".
2. Generality test: does this failure mode apply to ≥3 contexts/codebases? If not, abstract one level up.
3. Write as a universal rule — strip project-specific names/paths/classes. Useful on any codebase.
4. Consolidate: multiple mistakes sharing one failure mode → ONE lesson.
5. **Recurrence gate:** "Would this recur in future session WITHOUT this reminder?" — No → skip `$learn`.
6. **Auto-fix gate:** "Could `$code-review`/`$code-simplifier`/`$security-review`/`$lint` catch this?" — Yes → improve review skill instead.
7. BOTH gates pass → ask user to run `$learn`.
**[CRITICAL-THINKING-MINDSET]** Apply critical thinking, sequential thinking. Every claim needs traced proof, confidence >80% to act.
**Anti-hallucination principle:** Never present guess as fact — cite sources for every claim, admit uncertainty freely, self-check output for errors, cross-reference independently, stay skeptical of own confidence — certainty without evidence root of all hallucination.
**AI Attention principle (Primacy-Recency):** Put the 3 most critical rules at both top and bottom of long prompts/protocols so instruction adherence survives long context windows.
**Goal-driven execution:** Define success criteria first, loop until verified, and stop only when observable checks pass.
**Tests verify intent:** Tests must protect business rules/invariants and fail when the protected intent breaks, not only mirror current behavior.
## Common AI Mistake Prevention (System Lessons)

- **Re-read files after context compaction.** Edit requires prior Read in same context; compaction wipes read state. Re-read before editing.
- **Grep for old terms after bulk replacements.** AI over-trusts find/replace completeness. Grep full repo after bulk edits for missed refs in docs/configs/catalogs.
- **Check downstream references before deleting.** Deletions cascade doc/code staleness. Map referencing files before removal.
- **After memory loss, check existing state before creating new.** Compaction wipes prior-work memory. Query current state to resume — never blindly duplicate.
- **Verify AI-generated content against actual code.** AI hallucinates APIs, class names, method signatures. Grep to confirm existence before documenting/referencing.
- **Trace full dependency chain after edits.** Changing a definition misses downstream consumers. Trace the full chain.
- **When renaming, grep ALL consumer file types.** Some file types silently ignore missing refs (no compile error). Search code, templates, configs, generated files.
- **Trace ALL code paths when verifying correctness.** Code existing ≠ code executing. Trace early exits, error branches, conditional skips — not just happy path.
- **Update docs that embed canonical data when source changes.** Docs inlining derived data (workflows, schemas, configs) go stale silently. Update all embedding docs alongside source.
- **Verify sub-agent results after context recovery.** Background agents may finish while parent compacted — grep-verify output, don't trust assumed completion.
- **Cross-check full target list against sub-agent assignments.** Parallel sub-agents by category miss boundary items. Reconcile union of assignments against target list before proceeding.
- **Sub-agents inherit knowledge only from their agent .md definition — use custom agent types, not built-in Explore.** Tool adoption = permission + knowledge + enforcement (numbered workflow step).
- **Persist sub-agent findings incrementally, not as a final batch.** Long sub-agents hit cutoffs before final write — findings lost. Instruct append-per-section to report file.
- **When debugging, ask "whose responsibility?" before fixing.** Trace caller (wrong data) vs callee (wrong handling). Fix at responsible layer — never patch symptom site.
- **Test failure → record a provisional verdict before trace/edit, then investigate.** Use the full five-way taxonomy: SOURCE-WRONG (production violates intent), TEST-WRONG (assertion/setup is stale), TEST-NOT-OPTIMAL (valid but fragile or low-signal test), ENVIRONMENT-BLOCKED (external state prevents a verdict), or AMBIGUOUS (intent/evidence cannot choose safely). Then trace root cause and triangulate against the governing spec (`docs/specs/**` if one exists) AND source. NEVER weaken an assertion, add a skip, relax a timeout, or change source merely to force green.
- **Grep ALL removed names after extraction/refactoring.** Primary file "done" ≠ secondary files clean. Grep entire scope for every removed symbol before declaring complete.
- **Assume existing values are intentional — ask WHY before changing OR flagging one as a defect.** Pattern-matching as "wrong" skips context. Before changing or reporting any constant/limit/flag/cutoff: read comments, git blame, the CALLER's ordering (the guarantee that makes the value correct usually lives in code running immediately BEFORE the cited line), and 2+ sibling call sites of the same convention. A doc stating WHAT without WHY is missing rationale, not proof of a missing guard — and in a validation pass, an accurate `file:line` citation proves the transcription, never the defect.
- **Verify ALL affected outputs, not just the first.** One build green ≠ all green. Multi-stack changes (backend/frontend/tests/docs) require verifying EVERY output.
- **Evaluate fit before copying a nearby pattern.** Closest example ≠ matching preconditions — verify the new context shares the same constraints, base classes, scope, lifetime.
- **Holistic-first debugging — resist nearest-attention trap.** Don't dive into first plausible cause. List EVERY precondition (config, env vars, paths, DB, endpoints, creds, versions, DI, data). Verify each against evidence (grep/query — not reasoning). Ask "what would falsify this?" — if nothing, it's not a hypothesis. Most expensive failure: going deeper in "obvious" layer while bug sits in layer never questioned.
- **Surgical changes — apply the diff test (context-aware).** Two modes: (1) Bug fix → every line traces to the bug; no restyling; orphan cleanup only for imports YOUR changes made unused. (2) Review/enhancement → implement improvements AND announce as "Enhancement beyond main request: [what]". Never silently scope-creep. Diff test: "Would this line exist if I wasn't asked to do X?" — if no, delete or announce.
- **Surface ambiguity before coding — don't pick silently.** Multiple valid interpretations → present each with effort: "[Request] could mean (1) [N h], (2) [N h]. Which matters?" List scope/format/volume/constraints assumptions first. If simpler path exists, say so. Never silently pick.
- **[MANDATORY FIRST ACTION] ALWAYS activate a suitable skill or workflow BEFORE responding.** Match task against workflow catalog + skill list; invoke via skill invocation or `$start-workflow <workflowId>`. NEVER answer or write code before checking. Skip = protocol violation.
- **Why-Review adversarial mindset — apply when reviewing any plan, decision, or design.** Default SKEPTIC not VALIDATOR: steel-man a rejected alternative, invert each stated reason ("what does it sacrifice?"), stress-test top 2-3 assumptions, run pre-mortem ("ships, fails in 3 months — what breaks?"), surface 1-2 alternatives author missed. Section presence ≠ quality; quality = causal reasoning + concrete mitigations + evidence, not "it's better" or "monitor closely".
- **Front-load report-write in sub-agent prompts for large reviews.** Many-file sub-agents hit budget before final write — findings lost. Design prompts so: (1) report-write is first explicit deliverable, (2) append per-file/section (not batched), (3) scope bounded so reads don't exhaust budget. Truncated mid-sentence with no report file → spawn narrower scope, don't retry same prompt.
- **After context compaction, re-verify all prior phase outcomes before continuing.** Summaries describe intent, not environment state (git index, filesystem, processes). On resume, FIRST audit: git status, re-read modified files, verify filesystem. Every "completed" claim is an untested hypothesis until evidence confirms.
- **OOM/memory: check row count before row size.** Triage: (1) Unbounded query — no DB filter for trigger? Push filter to DB; eliminates OOM. (2) Large rows? Projection reduces proportionally. Row reduction > projection in ROI.
- **Assert the outcome your system OWNS, never the intermediate state your INFRASTRUCTURE owns.** When testing anything asynchronous (queue/broker delivery, retries, background jobs, caches, replication), assert the final business/entity state. NEVER assert the delivery bookkeeping — consume/send status, attempt counts, last-error, row existence or counts in a broker, scheduler, or outbox/inbox table. That bookkeeping lives in shared infrastructure that ANY co-running process (a peer worker, a second replica, a leftover local container) can write, usually under a deterministic shared key, so the assertion silently tests the developer's environment instead of the system: green when run alone, flaky the instant anything else shares that broker + database. Gate question for every assertion: "would this hold no matter WHICH process did the work?" — if no, assert the converged data state instead. Corollary: process-local fault injection and in-process telemetry cannot gate work any process may perform — use them as stress amplifiers (arm → bounded window → disarm → assert convergence), never as preconditions.
- **Keep domain concepts out of generic/shared/infrastructure layers.** Reusable layer (shared library, framework, infra module) must reference NO consumer-specific domain concept — tenant/customer/product IDs, business entities, feature rules. Leak compiles + runs → passes review silently while coupling the "reusable" layer to one consumer. Keep shared type domain-free; push domain fields/logic down into the consumer via subclass/composition. — why: a layer coupled to one consumer's domain is no longer reusable.
