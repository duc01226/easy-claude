> Codex compatibility note:
> - Invoke repository skills with `$skill-name` in Codex; this mirrored copy rewrites legacy Claude `/skill-name` references.
> - Host-native execution: Codex runs a skill by loading its `SKILL.md` instructions and executing the required steps with available tools. No separate `Skill` tool is required; a loaded skill is already activated.
> - Source vs execution: prefer the registered `.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` for Codex execution. `.claude/**` remains the canonical authoring source; reading it for a registry or source inspection does not switch this session to Claude Code.
> - Capability check: interpret Claude tool names through the active host before declaring a blocker. Continue when Codex can perform the required operation; stop and ask only when the actual capability is unavailable, naming the step and evidence. Host-native execution is not a protocol deviation and needs no extra approval.
> - Task tracker mandate: BEFORE executing any workflow or skill step, create/update task tracking for all steps and keep it synchronized as progress changes.
> - Use ask user question tool to ask user.
> - Ignore Claude-specific mode-switch instructions when they appear.
> - Strict execution contract: when a user explicitly invokes a skill, execute that skill protocol as written.
> - Subagent authorization: when a skill is user-invoked or AI-detected and its protocol requires subagents, that skill activation authorizes use of the required `spawn_agent` subagent(s) for that task.
> - Do not skip, reorder, or merge protocol steps unless the user explicitly approves the deviation first.
> - For workflow skills, steps follow the guided contract in `$start-workflow` (gate steps fixed; other steps may flex with a logged reason); report step-by-step evidence.
> - If a required step/tool cannot run in this environment, stop and ask the user before adapting.

## Workflow Calls and Todo Bootstrap

Read [the registry](../../../.claude/workflows.json) → `workflows.workflow-feature` together with this skill. Call [`$start-workflow workflow-feature`](../start-workflow/SKILL.md) to resolve the selected mode, pre-actions and fingerprint.

**Todo FIRST:** create ALL selected occurrence tasks before triage, analysis or step execution, including conditional/optional tasks; preserve occurrence IDs, roles and barrier groups. Use native task tools or an equivalent persistent ledger. Then mark the first task `in_progress`; attach evidence before `completed`.
Mode selection and registry loading prepare tracking; any 'first action' below means the first substantive action after this bootstrap.

**Call each step skill:** read its linked SKILL.md and execute its protocol through the active host with the registry args. Reading or naming a skill alone is not execution. Required gates and core/optional flex follow the linked start-workflow Step Execution Protocol; keep this skill's quality gates, loops and evidence requirements.

**Conditions:** load each occurrence's registry `applicability.when` and `skipReason` verbatim, and record its run/skip evidence through the linked start-workflow protocol. Do not silently omit a task or turn a conditional skill into an unconditional call. Declared parallel groups retain their all-return barrier.

Explicit step-skill calls by mode (registry order; roles and conditions remain owned by the registry):

- Mode `default`: [`$investigate`](../investigate/SKILL.md) (core) → [`$spec [mode=discovery]`](../spec/SKILL.md) (optional; conditional) → [`$domain-analysis`](../domain-analysis/SKILL.md) (optional; conditional) → [`$why-review`](../why-review/SKILL.md) (optional; conditional) → [`$spec`](../spec/SKILL.md) (core) → [`$spec [mode=clarify]`](../spec/SKILL.md) (optional; conditional) → [`$scenario`](../scenario/SKILL.md) (optional; conditional) → [`$pbi --mode=mockup --explore`](../pbi/SKILL.md) (optional; conditional) → [`$spec [mode=tests]`](../spec/SKILL.md) (core) → [`$pbi --mode=review --type=spec-tests`](../pbi/SKILL.md) (core) → [`$plan`](../plan/SKILL.md) (core) → [`$plan --mode=validate`](../plan/SKILL.md) (optional; conditional) → [`$plan --mode=execute`](../plan/SKILL.md) (core) → [`$seed-test-data`](../seed-test-data/SKILL.md) (optional; conditional) → [`$integration-test`](../integration-test/SKILL.md) (core) → [`$spec [mode=sync]`](../spec/SKILL.md) (core) → [`$workflow-review-changes --tests=defer`](../workflow-review-changes/SKILL.md) (gate) → [`$integration-test --mode=verify`](../integration-test/SKILL.md) (core) → [`$workflow-e2e --source=context`](../workflow-e2e/SKILL.md) (optional; conditional) → [`$test`](../test/SKILL.md) (gate) → [`$demo-guide`](../demo-guide/SKILL.md) (optional; conditional) → [`$workflow-end`](../workflow-end/SKILL.md) (gate) → [`$watzup`](../watzup/SKILL.md) (core)

## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Deliver a well-defined feature whose reviewed canonical spec matches the implementation, verified tests and converged change review.

**Summary:**

- Triage size, kind and risk; activate the workflow and resolve its registry, Goal Contract and artifact authority.
- Main route: investigate → spec discovery → domain analysis → rationale review → spec authoring → clarification → scenarios → explore mockup → test specs → test-spec review → plan → plan validation → execute → QC seed data → integration tests → spec sync → static change review → integration verification → E2E → remaining tests → demo → close → handoff. Evaluate optional steps by the registry's conditions and record its skip reasons.
- Preserve spec-first/test-first dependencies, human approval gates and verify-last ordering; close only with the required outcome evidence. Spec-complete work uses `workflow-implement-spec`; large ambiguous work uses `workflow-big-feature`.

## Purpose

Deliver a well-defined feature spec-first and test-first: the canonical Feature Spec states the intended behavior, test specs are written and reviewed before implementation, and the run ends with green tests, a converged change review and a spec re-verified against what was actually built. Use it when no canonical spec holds the requested behavior yet — this workflow updates the spec first. Spec-complete work goes to `workflow-implement-spec`; large, ambiguous or research-heavy work belongs in `workflow-big-feature`; a focused one-module change with no contract change is usually a custom-simple route, not this workflow.

Activate the `workflow-feature` workflow. Run `$start-workflow workflow-feature` with the user's prompt as context.

## Size & Kind Triage (first action)

Classify the target before choosing steps and record the result in the run report:

- **Size (guidance, not a law):** **XS** 1–3 files / ≤100 changed lines · **S** ≤15 files · **M** ≤60 · **L** ≤300 · **XL** >300
- **Kind (one or more):** docs-only · tooling/config · test-only · behavior change · public contract/API · data/schema/migration · security-sensitive (auth, secrets, money, PII) · UI surface · infra/CI · cross-module/cross-service
- **Risk:** irreversible · data · security · cross-module
- **Large idea:** `isLargeIdea = multipleIndependentOutcomes || ambiguousOrResearchHeavy || releaseScopeDecomposition || oversizedPbiThatMustSplit` (`shared/product-roadmap-contract.md`)

Escalate depth on risk and ambiguity, not file count alone:

- **XS/S, one module, clear intent** — light investigation; update only the affected spec sections; one lean plan; no re-plan. Test specs receive one quality review before the build. Work inline — sub-agents rarely pay off.
- **M, or any public-contract, data/schema, security or cross-module kind** — every core step at full depth plus each optional step whose condition holds (`$scenario`, `$domain-analysis`, `$plan --mode=validate`, ...).
- **L/XL, or `isLargeIdea` true** — everything M runs, plus the embedded decomposition and bounded batches per module or slice for the build, test specs and review (one report per batch). A research-heavy scope that cannot be cut into slices → recommend `workflow-big-feature` to the user.

**Representation authority:** resolve `shared/sdd-artifact-contract.md` and the configured/native case contract before interpreting the gates. Section/TC examples below apply only to the strict fallback; native profiles use their declared intent/evidence roles, owner-qualified IDs, carriers and mapping relation. Never create a second registry or default section to satisfy an example; unresolved mappings block.

## Required Quality Gates

The run is not done until each applicable gate holds with its evidence:

- **Tests pass** (`tests-pass`) — `$test` ran green in THIS run — once, after the static review, with `$integration-test --mode=verify` (incl. the mutation check) for the integration suite; every changed behavior maps to a §8 TC that names its `Business Intent / Invariant Guarded` and would fail if that intent broke; lifecycle behavior asserts persisted state transitions and invalid-transition rejection
- **Review converged** (`review-converged`) — nested `$workflow-review-changes` ran inline in the main session and converged — validated blocking findings fixed and the fixed state re-reviewed
- **Spec synced** (`spec-synced`, when behavior or a public contract changed) — Feature Spec §1-7 re-verified against the built behavior (the post-implementation re-verify is part of the gate, not optional cleanup); every divergence adjudicated per `SYNC:spec-drift-adjudication` in `shared/sdd-artifact-contract.md` → Drift Gates: CODE-WRONG → fix code/tests, SPEC-STALE → `$spec` update then the test-spec update and `$spec [mode=sync]`, AMBIGUOUS → escalate to the spec owner; §8 TCs ↔ test code synced
- **Run closed** (`run-closed`) — `$workflow-end` checked every gate and emitted the Goal Satisfaction matrix
- **Spec-first, test-first** — the canonical Feature Spec was authored or updated before the first `$plan`; test specs were written and reviewed before `$plan --mode=execute`
- **Goal Contract** — the active Goal Contract is resolved at start per `SYNC:goal-contract-satisfaction-loop` (active plan `goal.md` → `goals/{YYMMDD-HHmm}-{slug}/goal.md` under the plans root, default `plans/`, relocated by `docsRoots.plans.path` in `docs/project-config.json` → create from the request); the plan's success criteria map to it before `$plan --mode=execute`; every child step reads that same goal file; closure needs every criterion PASS, or BLOCKED with a user-facing escalation
- **Plan Gate** — `$plan --mode=execute` never starts while the plan's `## Plan Gate` is `BLOCKED` or lacks human approval
- **Large idea** (when `isLargeIdea` is true) — the complete five-field `large_idea_decomposition` block (`outcome_slices`, `dependencies_order`, `non_goals`, `risks_evidence`, `deferred_work_owner`) sits in the owning spec/PBI before the first mutating `$spec` and carries its slice IDs through downstream presentation/mock-up artifacts; all-false work omits it; a genuinely isolated brownfield change records `EXEMPT` with reason and accepting owner and keeps the spec, scenario, test, review and human-confirmation gates. This workflow never creates a roadmap artifact — an explicitly supplied roadmap is read-only context
- **Existing behavior preserved** (when an existing final output, persisted state, API response, projection or user-visible flow changes) — before the build: an end-to-start trace of the existing path (final reader → storage/projection → writer → producer/origin), its feeder paths, the invariants to keep, and forward proof for the new behavior; the plan and review evidence state expected, unchanged and no-regression behavior
- **Performance route** (when the feature is a performance enhancement) — `$performance-review` with SLA/benchmark evidence — target metric, baseline, measurement command, regression budget; `$plan --mode=execute` still runs; functional no-regression checks run whenever behavior can change; spec/docs updated for a changed SLA, performance constraint or behavior boundary
- **UI intent** (when user-facing behavior changed) — alongside `$spec [mode=sync]`, the Feature Spec §6 interaction surface (View Inventory, Key UI States, per-story click-path) is refreshed per `SYNC:ui-intent-layer` and linked to the governing `$design-spec`; a backend-only change states its skip reason

## Gates and Optional Steps

**Step contract:** `$start-workflow` → Step Execution Protocol owns how gate, core and optional steps run; the registry (`.claude/workflows.json` → `workflow-feature`, delivered in the Tier-2 output) owns each step's role and its `applicability` (`when` / `skipReason`, recorded verbatim on skip). This table adds only what the registry does not state: what each step proves or feeds, plus triage hints.

| Step | Role | Proves / feeds · triage hint |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$investigate` | core | plan evidence — read the affected area's spec under the business spec root first (default `docs/specs`; a `specRoots.business.path` entry in `docs/project-config.json` overrides the path) and find 3+ local examples |
| `$spec [mode=discovery]` | optional | overlaps and missing TCs before authoring — pass this run's investigation report as `--investigation=<report path>` so it is not re-run |
| `$domain-analysis` | optional | entity model, ownership |
| `$why-review` | optional | design rationale |
| `$spec` | core | spec-first gate — Feature Spec §1-7 before planning |
| `$spec [mode=clarify]` | optional | user-confirmed decisions |
| `$scenario` | optional | plan risk coverage |
| `$pbi --mode=mockup --explore` | optional | selected mockup before planning — see New-UI Explore Mockup below |
| `$spec [mode=tests]` | core | test-first gate — every invariant mapped to TC IDs in §8 |
| `$pbi --mode=review --type=spec-tests` | core | test-spec quality |
| `$plan` | core | decisions, areas, discovery, gates — one lean plan over the reviewed intent and cases |
| `$plan --mode=validate` | optional | human plan approval |
| `$plan --mode=execute` | core | the change, the performance route included |
| `$seed-test-data` | optional | QC data |
| `$integration-test` | core | tests from the TCs (tests-pass) |
| `$spec [mode=sync]` | core | spec-synced — after executing tests exist, reconcile spec, cases and actual test evidence |
| `$workflow-review-changes --tests=defer` | gate | review-converged |
| `$integration-test --mode=verify` | core | tests-pass — the one verify, after the review; runs the mutation check |
| `$workflow-e2e --source=context` | optional | E2E evidence |
| `$test` | gate | tests-pass — pass `--proven=<integration-test --mode=verify report path>` so only tiers that report does not cover run |
| `$demo-guide` | optional | demo path |
| `$workflow-end` | gate | run-closed |
| `$watzup` | core | handoff summary |

**New-UI Explore Mockup (conditional, BEFORE `$plan`).** When the requirement or spec adds completely new user-facing UI — a new page/view, component or dialog — run `$pbi --mode=mockup --explore`, passing the spec (or the investigation report when no spec covers the UI yet) as `--source`. `pbi --mode=mockup` Step 0 owns the scope gate (asked first, before any analysis or drafting) and the direction pick; both run in the main session only. Record the outcome (`Mockup: SKIPPED by user` or the `Selection:` line) in the plan or run report; the plan's UI Layout builds on the selected mockup. Changes inside existing views skip it with the registry `skipReason`.

The registry's default order, parsed by the workflow verifier — keep it equal to `workflows.json`; the roles above decide what may flex:

**IMPORTANT MANDATORY Steps:** $investigate -> $spec [mode=discovery] -> $domain-analysis -> $why-review -> $spec -> $spec [mode=clarify] -> $scenario -> $pbi --mode=mockup --explore -> $spec [mode=tests] -> $pbi --mode=review --type=spec-tests -> $plan -> $plan --mode=validate -> $plan --mode=execute -> $seed-test-data -> $integration-test -> $spec [mode=sync] -> $workflow-review-changes --tests=defer -> $integration-test --mode=verify -> $workflow-e2e --source=context -> $test -> $demo-guide -> $workflow-end -> $watzup

**On-demand skills (not registry steps):**

- `$design-spec --mode=wireframe` — UI work arrives with an image or wireframe: run it before `$plan`; a design link alone (e.g. a Figma URL) → ask the user to export the frames as images. When `$plan` finds frontend phases, include the `ui-wireframe-protocol.md` sections in them.
- `$performance-review` — the performance route above.
- `$investigate --mode=debug` — a test fails and its cause is unknown; establish the root cause before editing either side.

`$workflow-e2e --source=context` runs only on an explicit E2E request ("include E2E", "write E2E", "run E2E", "do end-to-end verification"); otherwise it records its registry skip reason. When it runs, its nested workflow keeps default-on screenshot review and records evidence-backed `N/A` or `ENVIRONMENT-BLOCKED` when the repository lacks the capability.

## Orchestration Freedom

You choose inline vs sub-agent, parallel waves vs sequential, batching and ordering — optimize wall-clock and token cost at equal quality. **Main session only:** the mockup scope gate and pick (`pbi --mode=mockup` Step 0) never run inside a delegated sub-agent. Only these data dependencies are fixed:

- a change exists before it is reviewed or tested; tests run once, last, after the static review (`--tests=defer`); a fix made by the verify step re-runs `$workflow-review-changes --tests=defer`, and a fix made by that re-review re-runs the verify (`SYNC:verify-last-order`);
- the Feature Spec precedes the first `$plan`, and test specs are reviewed before `$plan --mode=execute`;
- `$integration-test` authors the executing evidence before one `$spec [mode=sync]` reconciliation; the sync runs before the review that checks it;
- the nested `$workflow-review-changes` runs inline in the main session — it owns the session's review→fix→re-review loop, and its own reviewers run as sub-agents;
- gates awaiting user approval (`$spec [mode=clarify]`, `$plan --mode=validate`, Plan Gate approval) are never parallelized;
- `$workflow-end` runs last, then `$watzup`.

Recommended: independent read-only work in one parallel wave (`$spec [mode=discovery]` follows `$investigate` and reuses its report); L/XL partitioned into bounded batches per module or slice with one report per batch; XS/S done inline. The nested review owns `$integration-test --mode=review`, `$security-audit`, `$domain-analysis --mode=review`, `$experience-review` and the conditional domain-entity reference refresh (`$scan --target=domain-entities` → `$docs-manager --mode=update`, run when the final diff changes an entity, data contract or schema represented in `domain-entities-reference.md`); this workflow's tail does not repeat them. `$experience-review` records `NOT-APPLICABLE` or `ENVIRONMENT-BLOCKED` honestly and never promotes a new expectation without explicit acceptance.

## Memory & Reporting

- One task per selected step (and per batch for L/XL) so nothing is lost after compaction; a step that does not run keeps its task, closed with its logged deviation.
- Write the run report FIRST under `tmp/reports/` — triage result, gate evidence, deviations — and append per step or batch; re-read it and the current task list after compaction.
- Sub-agent briefs carry the goal file path and the resolved reference-doc paths, and make report-writing their first deliverable.
- Project conventions come from `docs/project-config.json` and `docs/project-reference/docs-index-reference.md`; apply the shared SDD Artifact Contract (`shared/sdd-artifact-contract.md` in the active skills root). Any supported AI tool may implement or review once that contract, synced context and local docs are available. Code-extracted specs and TCs stay reference-only until canonical review accepts them.

## Fix Path & Loop Bounds

- Validate findings (evidence-backed, reproducible) before fixing; fix at the owning layer; re-run the reviewer or test that raised each finding, plus a holistic pass when the fixes were non-trivial.
- A failing test gets a root-cause verdict before either the source or the test is edited; never weaken an assertion to force green.
- Replanning is exceptional: only a material scope/contract decision invalidating the saved plan returns to `$plan`; ordinary implementation discovery stays with the executor.
- Review loops (each `$pbi --mode=review` occurrence, the nested review): round 1 exits on zero open validated findings (LOW deferral); round 2 exits on zero CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM with LOW-only findings deferred; cap 3 review rounds; failed checks block and at the three-round cap require explicit user-approved bounded extension; escalate with `ask user question tool` on no progress. Convergence lives inside each skill's own loop, so the sequence lists each review once.
- Spec-loop discipline: §8 derives invariant/property TCs for every hard rule and invariant, not only example scenarios; every behavior-changing finding updates BOTH the spec and the tests, never code alone.

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** debugger trace gate: for non-trivial bug/fix/investigation/review work, start at the observed final output and trace backward through reader -> storage/projection -> writer -> consumer/job -> producer/trigger. Enumerate all feeder paths and hypotheses before fixing; select the authoritative invariant owner from project architecture and retain validation at untrusted boundaries. **BLOCKED until** trace, hypothesis matrix, owning fix layer, and forward convergence proof exist.

- **MANDATORY** A finding names a reachable trigger path (caller, input, state or event that reaches the defect) and a consequence; an unreachable concern is an observation, and unsettled reachability is `NOT VERIFIABLE` only when the concern would be MEDIUM or higher (an observation otherwise) — never a speculative LOW.
- **MANDATORY** Keep binary gates separate from severity: a failed test, security must-fix, required artifact, or parity check blocks at every round and is never relabeled LOW.

## Closing Reminders

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION Goal:** Deliver a well-defined feature whose reviewed canonical spec matches the implementation, verified tests and converged change review.

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION Main route:** triage and activate → investigate → spec discovery → domain analysis → rationale review → spec authoring → clarification → scenarios → explore mockup → test specs → test-spec review → plan → plan validation → execute → QC seed data → integration tests → spec sync → static change review → integration verification → E2E → remaining tests → demo → close → handoff. Registry conditions govern optional steps; record their skip reasons.

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** triage size, kind and risk FIRST — depth follows risk and ambiguity, not file count; record the triage and every deviation.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** gates never flex: tests green in THIS run · nested `$workflow-review-changes` converged inline · Feature Spec re-verified and synced when behavior changed · Goal Satisfaction matrix at `$workflow-end`.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** spec before the first `$plan`, test specs reviewed before `$plan --mode=execute`; a `BLOCKED` Plan Gate stops the build.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** large ideas embed the five-field `large_idea_decomposition`; this workflow never creates a roadmap artifact.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** cite `file:line` evidence with confidence >80% to act; tests name the invariant they guard and fail when it breaks.
