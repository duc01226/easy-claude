## Codex Project-Reference Loading (Hook-Independent)

Claude and Codex use static project-reference loading as the authority; hooks may accelerate discovery but never replace the explicit read.
When coding, planning, debugging, testing, or reviewing, open project docs explicitly using this routing.

**Always read:**
- `docs/project-config.json` (project-specific paths, commands, modules, and workflow/test settings)
- `docs/project-reference/docs-index-reference.md` (routes to the full `docs/project-reference/*` catalog)
- `docs/project-reference/lessons.md` (always-on guardrails and anti-patterns)

**Missing/stale context route:** If `docs/project-config.json`, the docs index, `lessons.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, or any task-required reference doc is missing or stale, auto-run `$project-init` or the narrow setup route (`$project-config`, `$docs-init`, `$scan-all`, `$scan --target=<key>`, `$ai-context-refresh`) before ordinary project-specific work. A full `$sync-codex` run preflights `CLAUDE.md`; a completed `$ai-context-refresh` run may invoke the standalone runner with `--skip=claude-md` after final source edits. Markerless roots need AI smart-merge unless `portability.requireUniversalGuides: false` is explicit.

**Situation-based docs:**
- Project structure/architecture/tech-stack/deployment/setup (any layer — backend, frontend, or infra): `project-structure-reference.md`
- Backend/CQRS/API/domain/entity changes: `backend-patterns-reference.md`, `domain-entities-reference.md`
- Frontend/UI/styling/design-system: `frontend-patterns-reference.md`, `configured styling reference`, `design-system/README.md`
- Spec authoring, `docs/specs/` pathing, or TC format: `feature-spec-reference.md`, `spec-system-reference.md`, `spec-principles.md`
- Behavior/public-contract changes or spec-test-code sync: `workflow-spec-test-code-cycle-reference.md` plus the spec docs above
- Derived spec indexes/ERDs/reimplementation guides: `spec-system-reference.md` and source Feature Specs under `docs/specs/`
- Integration test implementation/review: `integration-test-reference.md`
- E2E test implementation/review: `e2e-test-reference.md`
- Code review/audit work: `code-review-rules.md` plus domain docs above based on changed files

Do not read all docs blindly. Start from `docs-index-reference.md`, then open only relevant files for the task.

## Quick Summary

**Goal:** [Workflow] Trigger Feature Implementation workflow — implement a well-defined feature with investigation, planning, implementation, and review. This workflow is spec-driven with tests by default: test specs (`$spec [mode=tests]`) are written and reviewed BEFORE implementation (`$plan-execute`), covering former TDD/test-first use cases.

**Summary:**

- Apply the shared `isLargeIdea` rule before the first mutating `$spec`; when true, carry the five-field `large_idea_decomposition` block through the owning spec/PBI and downstream presentation/mock-up artifacts. Do not create a roadmap artifact by default.
- For a genuinely isolated brownfield change, carry the shared contract's EXEMPT reason/owner and retain spec, scenario, test, review, and human-confirmation gates.
- Follow the investigation → spec → scenario → plan → review → implementation → verification sequence; never let implementation outrun product readiness.

 - **Main steps:** investigate → spec/clarify → scenario → plan/review/validate → pre-implementation test specs → implement → integration/spec sync → review → optional near-end `workflow-e2e` on explicit request → security/test/docs/demo handoff.

**Workflow:**

1. **Detect** — classify request scope and target artifacts.
2. **Execute** — apply required steps with evidence-backed actions.
3. **Verify** — confirm constraints, output quality, and completion evidence.

**Key Rules:**

- MUST ATTENTION keep claims evidence-based (`file:line`) with confidence >80% to act.
- MUST ATTENTION keep task tracking updated as each step starts/completes.
- MUST ATTENTION when creating/reviewing specs or tests, name `Business Intent / Invariant Guarded` or the protected business intent/invariant and ensure the test would fail if that intent breaks.
- MUST ATTENTION define success criteria before execution and loop until observable verification passes.
- MUST ATTENTION require test specs/tests to name `Business Intent / Invariant Guarded` and fail if that intent breaks.
- MUST ATTENTION apply the shared SDD Artifact Contract from `shared/sdd-artifact-contract.md` in the active skills root; use `docs/project-config.json` and `docs/project-reference/docs-index-reference.md` for project-specific conventions.
- MUST ATTENTION preserve expected, unchanged, and no-regression behavior in the plan and review evidence when behavior can change.
- MUST ATTENTION treat code-extracted specs and TCs as reference-only until canonical review accepts them.
- MUST ATTENTION apply `isLargeIdea = multipleIndependentOutcomes || ambiguousOrResearchHeavy || releaseScopeDecomposition || oversizedPbiThatMustSplit` before the first mutating `$spec`. A true signal requires `outcome_slices`, `dependencies_order`, `non_goals`, `risks_evidence`, and `deferred_work_owner`; all-false work omits them. Run `$scenario` after spec clarification only when slice risks require it. An explicitly supplied roadmap is read-only context; the standalone writer is explicit-only.
- MUST ATTENTION allow any supported AI tool to implement or review when the shared contract, synced context, and local docs are available.
- NEVER skip mandatory workflow or skill gates.

## Repeated Steps Disambiguation (CRITICAL for task creation)

This workflow has steps that appear multiple times. When creating tasks, use these descriptions to distinguish them:

| Step                                 | Occurrence   | Task Description                                 |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `$plan`                              | 1st (pos 8) | PLAN₁: Feature Spec-backed implementation plan   |
| `$plan`                              | 2nd (pos 13) | PLAN₂: Sprint-ready plan incorporating TDD specs |
| `$plan-review`                       | 1st (pos 9) | Review PLAN₁                                     |
| `$plan-review`                       | 2nd (pos 14) | Review PLAN₂                                     |
| `$spec [mode=tests]`                 | 1st (pos 11) | TDD-SPEC₁: Pre-implementation test specs         |
| `$spec [mode=tests]`                 | 2nd (pos 18) | TDD-SPEC₂: Post-implementation test spec update  |
| `$artifact-review --type=spec-tests` | 1st (pos 12) | Review TDD-SPEC₁                                 |
| `$artifact-review --type=spec-tests` | 2nd (pos 19) | Review TDD-SPEC₂                                 |

**NEVER deduplicate** — each occurrence is a distinct task with a different purpose.

## Conditional UI Planning

When a feature involves UI changes (detected during `$investigate`):

- If an image or wireframe is provided → route to `$design-spec --mode=wireframe` before `$plan`; if only a design link (e.g. a Figma URL) is provided, ask the user to export the frames as images first
- If `$plan` detects frontend phases → ensure `ui-wireframe-protocol.md` sections are included in plan phases
- This is advisory — NOT a mandatory workflow step change. The existing workflow sequence remains unchanged.

## Closing Rule

Every non-skipped step = `TaskUpdate in_progress` → skill invocation → complete skill → `TaskUpdate completed`. A cited conditional skip explicitly authorized by canonical `preActions.injectContext` may complete without a skill call.

**[TASK-PLANNING]** Before acting, analyze task scope and systematically break it into small todo tasks and sub-tasks using task tracking.

> **[IMPORTANT]** Analyze how big the task is and break it into many small todo tasks systematically before starting — this is very important.

> **Existing-behavior trace gate:** If the feature modifies an existing final output, persisted state, API response, projection, or user-visible workflow, include an end-to-start trace of the existing path (final reader -> storage/projection -> writer -> producer/origin), feeder paths, invariants to preserve, and forward proof for the intended new behavior before implementation.

> **Goal Contract propagation (workflow-owned):** At workflow start, resolve the active Goal Contract per `SYNC:goal-contract-satisfaction-loop` (active plan `goal.md` → `goals/{YYMMDD-HHmm}-{slug}/goal.md` under the plans root, default `plans/`, relocated by `docsRoots.plans.path` in `docs/project-config.json` → create from the feature request). Before `$plan-execute`, verify the plan's feature success criteria map to the saved criteria. Pass the same goal file reference to every child step — child skills read the SAME saved goal, never a re-derived one from chat memory. Before `$workflow-end`, emit the final Goal Satisfaction matrix (PASS/FAIL/BLOCKED); workflow completion requires every required criterion PASS or BLOCKED with a user-facing escalation.

> **Large-Idea preflight:** Before the first mutating `$spec` for a new, broad, ambiguous, release-scoped, or multi-capability outcome, evaluate the shared four-operand rule and require the complete embedded decomposition block in the owning artifacts. After spec clarification and before `$plan`, run `$scenario` conditionally for replay/state/ownership/recovery risks. A `BLOCKED` Plan Gate stops `$plan-execute`; no default roadmap file is created.

**IMPORTANT MANDATORY Steps:** $investigate -> $spec-discovery -> $domain-analysis -> $why-review -> $spec -> $spec-clarify -> $scenario -> $plan -> $plan-review -> $plan-validate -> $spec [mode=tests] -> $artifact-review --type=spec-tests -> $plan -> $plan-review -> $plan-execute -> $seed-test-data -> $spec [mode=tests] -> $artifact-review --type=spec-tests -> $spec [mode=sync] -> $integration-test -> $integration-test-verify -> $workflow-review-changes -> $workflow-e2e --source=context -> $test -> $demo-guide -> $workflow-end -> $watzup

> **[EXPERIENCE ACCEPTANCE HANDOFF]** `$workflow-review-changes` carries the conditional `$experience-review` gate after code/rationale convergence. It exercises and inspects configured or likely observable surfaces, records `NOT-APPLICABLE` or `ENVIRONMENT-BLOCKED` honestly, and never promotes a new expectation without explicit acceptance.

> **[OPTIONAL E2E HANDOFF]** The sequence includes `$workflow-e2e --source=context` immediately after `$workflow-review-changes`. Run this occurrence only when the user explicitly requests E2E work, including wording such as “include E2E,” “write E2E,” “call E2E,” “run E2E,” or “do end-to-end verification.” Otherwise skip it with the manifest applicability reason; the step is disabled by default. When run, its nested workflow uses the default-on screenshot review and records evidence-backed `N/A` or `ENVIRONMENT-BLOCKED` when the repository lacks the applicable capability.

---

**IMPORTANT MANDATORY Steps:** $investigate -> $spec-discovery -> $domain-analysis -> $why-review -> $spec -> $spec-clarify -> $scenario -> $plan -> $plan-review -> $plan-validate -> $spec [mode=tests] -> $artifact-review --type=spec-tests -> $plan -> $plan-review -> $plan-execute -> $seed-test-data -> $spec [mode=tests] -> $artifact-review --type=spec-tests -> $spec [mode=sync] -> $integration-test -> $integration-test-verify -> $workflow-review-changes -> $workflow-e2e --source=context -> $test -> $demo-guide -> $workflow-end -> $watzup

> **Single-pass steps are self-loop-backed (convergence lives in the skill, not the sequence):** both `$artifact-review --type=spec-tests` occurrences appear once each in the flat sequence with no repeat wired — intentionally. (`$domain-entities-review` is not a parent step here; it runs inside the nested `$workflow-review-changes` occurrence.) Each carries the full `SYNC:double-round-trip-review` self-loop (review → validate findings → fix validated findings → full re-review until the current exit bar is clear; round-2 LOW-only findings are deferred), so a single sequence occurrence still converges without spinning on polish. The workflow relies on that per-skill loop; it does NOT re-list the step to force convergence. (Contrast the seven specialists in `$workflow-review-changes` steps 3–9, whose scoped-re-run note lives in that skill.)

> **Severity-floor clarification:** the shared loop fixes only findings that block the current round. Round 1 fixes all validated findings; from round 2 onward, CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM findings remain blocking, while LOW-only findings are recorded as deferred and never open another fix/re-review round.

> **[BLOCKING]** Each non-skipped step MUST ATTENTION invoke its skill invocation — marking a task `completed` without skill invocation is a workflow violation, except a cited conditional skip explicitly authorized by canonical `preActions.injectContext`. NEVER batch-complete validation gates.

Activate the `workflow-feature` workflow. Run `$start-workflow workflow-feature` with the user's prompt as context.

> **Spec check (before investigation):** If the business spec root (default `docs/specs/`; a `specRoots.business.path` entry in `docs/project-config.json` overrides the path) has a spec for the affected service/module, read the relevant ERD + business-rules + API-contracts files FIRST. Engineering specs provide domain context that reduces investigation time significantly. Command: list that resolved root to discover available app buckets or flat system folders; then probe its `{app-bucket}/` or `{system-name}/` subdirectory to find the specific service spec.

**Steps:** $investigate → $spec-discovery → $domain-analysis → $why-review → $spec → $spec-clarify → $scenario → $plan → $plan-review → $plan-validate → $spec [mode=tests] → $artifact-review --type=spec-tests → $plan → $plan-review → $plan-execute → $seed-test-data → $spec [mode=tests] → $artifact-review --type=spec-tests → $spec [mode=sync] → $integration-test → $integration-test-verify → $workflow-review-changes → $workflow-e2e --source=context → $test → $demo-guide → $workflow-end → $watzup

> **[CONDITIONAL TERMINAL DOMAIN-ENTITY REFERENCE REFRESH — DELEGATED]** The terminal `scan --target=domain-entities` → `docs-update` refresh is owned by the nested `$workflow-review-changes` occurrence: it runs the scan when the final diff changes an entity/model, DTO/data contract, persistence schema/migration, or entity-sync evidence represented in `domain-entities-reference.md` in the project-reference docs root (default `docs/project-reference/`; path from `docsRoots.projectReference.path` in `docs/project-config.json`), otherwise completes it with a cited skip reason. Do not repeat the scan in this workflow's tail.
>
> **[PERFORMANCE-SDD ROUTE]** If this feature is a performance enhancement (latency, throughput, memory, query speed, load behavior), run `$performance-review` and require SLA/benchmark evidence: target metric, baseline, measurement command, and acceptable regression budget. Run `$plan-execute` even on the performance route — never skip it. If behavior can change, run `$test` and any relevant functional no-regression checks. Update docs/specs for changed SLA, performance constraints, or behavior boundaries. Use project-specific performance docs from `docs/project-config.json` / `docs/project-reference/` when available.

> **[AI-SDD CLOSURE]** Before `$workflow-end`, confirm changed behavior, unchanged behavior, TCs/tests, docs and specs, and generated mirror sync are either completed or explicitly skipped with evidence.
>
> **[AI-SDD CLOSURE — POST-IMPLEMENTATION SPEC RE-VERIFY (MANDATORY)]** The `$spec` authored at step 6 (before `$plan`) captured _intended_ behavior. After `$plan-execute`, re-verify Feature Spec **§1-7** (not only §8 TCs) against what was _actually built_ and adjudicate every divergence per `shared/sdd-artifact-contract.md` → Drift Gates (`SYNC:spec-drift-adjudication`): **CODE-WRONG** → fix code/test against the spec; **SPEC-STALE** → run `$spec [update]` to record the new intended behavior, then `$spec [mode=tests] [update]` + `$spec [mode=sync]`; **AMBIGUOUS** → escalate to the spec owner. A feature that shipped behavior the spec does not describe leaves the spec stale and is NOT closure-ready. This re-verify is not optional cleanup — it is the "after implement, verify and create/update specs again" half of the SDD cycle.

> **UI-intent maintenance (conditional)** — runs alongside the `$spec [mode=sync]` step, **only when the change carries user-facing behavior** (else state the skip reason — backend-only change, no §6 change). When user-facing behavior is present, run `$spec` (ui-intent intent) to refresh the affected Feature Spec **§6** interaction surface — View Inventory, Key UI States, and the per-story (`US-`/`OP-`/`BR-`) click-path the feature touched — and link the governing `$design-spec`/mockup in the spec frontmatter so §6 and the design artifact stay coupled to what was actually built. The rules live in the shared block below (`SYNC:ui-intent-layer`) — follow it; do not restate it here.

<!-- SYNC:end-to-start-debugger-trace -->

> **End-to-Start Debugger Trace** — For non-trivial bugs, failed verification, regression fixes, behavior-changing code, or unclear code flow, start from the observed final state and walk backward before proposing a fix.
>
> 1. **Frame 0: observed end state** — Name the exact user-visible output, failing assertion, log line, persisted value, API response, rendered UI, or aggregate bucket. Record the reader/query/renderer that produced it with `file:line` evidence.
> 2. **Walk backward one hop at a time** — Trace final reader -> projection/cache/storage -> writer -> consumer/handler/job -> producer/caller -> original trigger. At every hop record: input, transformation, output, owner, and evidence.
> 3. **Enumerate all feeder paths** — Find every upstream producer/caller/event/job that can write into the final path, including retry, async, cache, background, and alternate UI/API paths. Mark each path verified, ruled out, or still unknown.
> 4. **Build the hypothesis matrix** — For each plausible cause, list evidence for, evidence against, how to reproduce/verify, blast radius, and status (`primary`, `contributing`, `ruled out`, `latent`). Do not fix until competing causes are explicitly resolved or bounded.
> 5. **Choose the owning fix layer** — Identify the invariant owner and select the authoritative correction and enforcement points from traced contracts and the project's architecture. Keep validation at untrusted boundaries. Choose a shared point only when evidence shows it owns the invariant for those consumers. A fix at the symptom site is rejected unless the symptom site owns the invariant.
> 6. **Prove convergence forward** — After choosing the fix, walk start -> end again and show how the corrected state reaches the observed final output. Map each root cause to a fix part and each fix part to a test/proof.
>
> **BLOCKED until:** final state named · backward trace written · all feeder paths enumerated · hypothesis matrix completed · owning fix layer justified · forward convergence proof mapped to tests.
>
> **NEVER:** Start at the first suspicious code path. Collapse multiple producers into one "flow". Treat duplicate symptoms as duplicate records without proving the read model. Skip ruled-out hypotheses.

<!-- SYNC:ai-mistake-prevention -->

> **AI Mistake Prevention** — Failure modes to avoid on every task:
>
> **Project applicability gate.** Before applying a stack, layer, style, tool, or architecture rule, read the project's config and relevant references, then check local implementations. Treat framework examples as examples; honor explicit N/A and do not require a technology or convention the project does not use.
> **ROOT-CAUSE GATE — INVESTIGATE FIRST.** Before applying any project-related correction, always use the project's root-cause investigation protocol and establish the cause; the failure site may be only a symptom.
> **FAILED-TEST GATE.** For any failed or unstable test, use the project's test-investigation protocol before editing source or tests; never change either side merely to force green.
> **Re-read files after context changes.** Context compaction, resume, or long-running work can make memory stale; verify current files before acting.
> **Verify generated content against source evidence.** AI hallucinates APIs, names, claims, and document facts. Check the relevant source before documenting or referencing.
> **Check downstream references before deleting or renaming.** Removing an artifact can stale docs, generated mirrors, configs, and callers; map references first.
> **Trace the full impact chain after edits.** Changing a definition can miss derived outputs and consumers. Follow the affected chain before declaring done.
> **Verify ALL affected outputs, not just the first.** One green check is not all green checks; validate every output surface the change can affect.
> **Assume existing values are intentional — ask WHY before changing OR flagging one as a defect.** Before changing or reporting a constant, limit, flag, cutoff, wording, or pattern, read nearby context and history, the CALLER's ordering, and 2+ sibling call sites of the same convention. A doc stating WHAT without WHY is missing rationale, not proof of a missing guard.
> **Surface ambiguity before acting — don't pick silently.** Multiple valid interpretations require an explicit question or stated assumption with risk.
> **Assert the outcome your system owns, not the intermediate state your infrastructure owns.** When verifying async work, assert the final business state — never the delivery/retry bookkeeping held in shared infrastructure that any co-running process can write. Such a check passes when run alone and flakes the moment anything else shares that infrastructure.
> **Store disposable generated output in the project workspace.** If an output can be regenerated and is not source code, a canonical source-of-truth, or an intentionally versioned projection, write it under the project-root `tmp/` or `temp/` directory (prefer `tmp/`), scoped to the run. This includes temporary state, integration/E2E results, reports, logs, screenshots, traces, videos, coverage, dumps, and candidate evidence. Never put these outputs in source, docs, the plans root (default `plans/`; a `docsRoots.plans.path` entry in `docs/project-config.json` overrides the path), the team-artifacts root (default `team-artifacts/`; `docsRoots.teamArtifacts.path` in the same config overrides the path), or mirror directories; the project-root `.gitignore` must ignore `/tmp/` and `/temp/` by default. Committed fixtures, accepted baselines, canonical specs/docs, and explicitly versioned generated mirrors remain at their declared owner paths.
> **Judge the environment before judging the code.** A bug report, failed test, error, or unexpected output is not proof of a code defect. Before and during adjudication, weigh environment causes as a competing hypothesis — setup, config, version and dependency state, service dependencies, stale artifacts or leftover state, and transient resource pressure (RAM, CPU, disk, handles, network). State the discriminator you ran; fix an environment cause in the environment, never by editing product code or weakening a test to absorb it.
> **Keep shared guidance role-relevant.** Universal guidance must help every receiving skill or agent; code-specific obligations belong only in code-specific protocols.

<!-- SYNC:incremental-persistence -->

> **Incremental Result Persistence** — MANDATORY for every visual-artifact review and for all sub-agents or heavy inline steps processing >3 files.
>
> 1. **Before starting:** Create report file `tmp/reports/{skill}-{date}-{slug}.md` and record Run ID, Task ID, Attempt ID, target scope, and target fingerprint. When visual artifacts are in scope, also record their ordered inventory and total; identify each screenshot, image, photo, or snapshot by path/name plus state and viewport when known.
> 2. **Checkpoint each review unit:** After each file or section, append findings, evidence, changed paths, and gaps immediately. For visual artifacts, open exactly ONE artifact, inspect it, and append its record BEFORE opening the next artifact. Each record includes artifact identity, state/viewport, inspection status, observations, severity-tagged issues with evidence, an explicit `none` when no issue exists, and any gap. NEVER batch multiple visual artifacts into one later write and never hold their findings in memory.
> 2a. **Resume from disk:** Treat the report's artifact records as the progress ledger. After interruption or context loss, read the report, derive processed and remaining artifacts from the ordered inventory, and continue at the first unprocessed artifact without duplicating completed records.
> 3. **Delegated return:** A sub-agent emits only the structured `SYNC:subagent-return-contract` envelope with exact totals, salient Critical/High findings (maximum ten), current attempt, and `Full report:` path. **Inline user-facing output:** Preserve the skill's requested explanation or teaching, with links to the persisted evidence; the delegated transport limit does not replace that deliverable. Do not paste a full review report into an envelope.
> 4. **Parent synthesis from persisted evidence:** The main agent reads the full report for synthesis, acceptance, deduplication, and repair planning — not only when a named blocker exists. For visual review, reconcile the ordered inventory against the artifact records before concluding; a missing record is incomplete review, never a clean result. Preserve all severities beyond the transport cap.
> 5. **Read-only boundary:** A read-only leaf may write its report/repair proposal but MUST NOT edit source, generated output, or user data; the parent/owner performs repairs after acceptance.
> 6. **Advancement gate:** The parent records `ACCEPTED` for the current Attempt ID only after reconciling target, totals, gaps, and changed paths; stale or late attempts cannot advance dependent work.
>
> **Why:** Context cutoff mid-execution loses ALL in-memory findings, and a large image set makes a final batch write especially fragile. Each per-unit disk write survives compaction. Partial results are better than no results, while explicit identity prevents a late result or a resumed image from being mistaken for the current run.

> **[BLOCKING] Capture a tech-agnostic UI/UX intent layer in every UI-bearing spec — a reader must be able to visualize how the feature works without naming any technology.** When the feature has a user interface, the spec MUST ATTENTION carry an interaction-surface section so the application — not just its API — can be rebuilt on any stack:
>
> **Native-first resolution.** A native contract may be declared by config or local references. Before authoring, resolve the configured profile's intent/evidence section roles, logical IDs, and carrier from `docs/project-config.json` (`specArtifacts`) and the required local references, and map every item below onto them. An unresolved owner, role, ID, carrier, or companion link stays `UNKNOWN`/`BLOCKED` — never guessed.
>
> 1. **View Inventory** — list each view/screen by its UX ROLE and purpose (e.g. "list of items", "item editor", "confirmation step") and what information it presents. Describe by role, never by an implementation name. Per view, record its **information priority** — each piece of information and each input the user meets is classified `now` (the view's task needs it), `later` (deferred to a follow-up view or step), or `not here` (belongs elsewhere) — and its **container role** (full view · focused dialog · side panel · stepped flow · inline edit), chosen for the task, never by habit.
> 2. **Navigation Map** — how a user moves between views: entry points, transitions, and exits. Trace how this surface connects to neighboring features already in the system.
> 3. **Key observable states** — the distinct states a user can observe per view (empty, loading, populated, error, success, permission-denied, etc.) — described as what the user perceives, not how it is rendered.
> 4. **Per-story action flows** — for each user story, the step-by-step click/action path from intent to outcome, cross-referenced to the logical IDs the configured profile owns.
> 5. **Couple to the companion design artifact** — keep deep visual fidelity (layout, tokens, pixel detail) OUT of the spec; it lives in the linked companion design artifact. Record that artifact's path in the spec frontmatter so the spec stays the navigable hub.
>
> **M1-clean (NON-NEGOTIABLE):** the prose names ZERO frameworks, routes/URLs, CSS, or component-class names — only roles, information, states, and action flows. Technology detail belongs in the companion design artifact, never here.
>
> **Strict portable fallback — only when neither config nor local references declares a native artifact contract:** cross-reference each action flow to the default logical IDs `US-`/`OP-`/`BR-`, and record the companion artifact in the default `design_spec:`/`mockup:` frontmatter keys.
>
> **Skip ONLY** when the feature is backend-only (no UI) — state that reason explicitly in the section.

<!-- /SYNC:ui-intent-layer -->

<!-- SYNC:severity-rubric -->

> **Severity Rubric** — Classify every finding by consequence, not by effort, reviewer preference, or how annoying the fix is. One scale applies to every review, skill, agent, workflow, and host so a tier has the same meaning everywhere. Choose the highest credible consequence supported by evidence; do not lower a tier to make a round pass.
>
> **Finding vs observation (required):** An observation becomes a finding only when it names the affected user/system/data/contract, the shipped consequence, the evidence location, and the normalized tier. `INFO`, advice, preference, duplicate wording, or an unsubstantiated concern is not a finding and must not reopen a loop. If the concern might affect a required behavior or gate but evidence is incomplete, emit `NOT VERIFIABLE` with the missing evidence and keep it unresolved; never silently convert uncertainty into LOW.
>
> | Severity | Action | Definition and examples |
> | --- | --- | --- |
> | CRITICAL | Block immediately; escalate | Immediate material risk if shipped: authentication/authorization or safety bypass; secrets/PII exposure; irreversible destructive action; data loss/corruption; or a silent failure on a critical path. A failed binary gate that makes the result untrustworthy is represented as a separate synthetic blocker by the executable policy (not as an ordinary severity judgment). |
> | HIGH | Must fix before PASS/merge | Material correctness or contract risk: wrong behavior on a supported path; violated business/data invariant; meaningful privacy or authority gap; breaking API/schema/compatibility change; likely harm to users/downstream systems; or a missing proof for a behavior-changing fix. |
> | MEDIUM | Must clear the current round; escalate if the fix needs an owner decision | Bounded but consequential risk: an edge case, resilience/observability/testability/maintainability gap, credible future defect, or local architectural drift whose impact is real but not immediate material loss. An explicit follow-up records the escalation/residual risk; it does not make an open MEDIUM a clean pass. |
> | LOW | Record and defer; never open another fix/re-review round from round 2 onward, and never counts toward the round-3 extension | Non-blocking polish with no credible present correctness, security, privacy, authority, availability, or data-integrity impact: wording/formatting, minor documentation or convention drift, optional defensive cleanup, or a cosmetic/refinement suggestion. |
>
> **Consequence decision tree (apply in order):** (1) Is a binary gate failed? Keep it as a separate hard blocker (the executable helper represents it as synthetic CRITICAL); do not use the ordinary severity label to hide what failed. Otherwise, would shipping permit immediate material security/safety/authority harm, irreversible destruction, data loss/corruption, or a critical-path silent failure? → **CRITICAL**. (2) Otherwise, does a supported path, invariant, public contract, privacy/authority boundary, compatibility promise, or behavior-changing proof fail with material user/downstream impact? → **HIGH**. (3) Otherwise, is there a bounded but consequential edge, resilience, observability, testability, maintainability, or architectural gap with a credible impact? → **MEDIUM**. (4) Otherwise, is the evidence sufficient to show only non-blocking polish with no credible present material impact? → **LOW**. (5) If the evidence needed to choose between steps 1–4 is missing, → **NOT VERIFIABLE**, not LOW. When multiple tiers fit, select the highest credible consequence; effort, implementation cost, reviewer discomfort, frequency alone, proximity to the round cap, and whether a tier would unlock or forfeit the conditional round-3 extension never decide the tier.
>
> **Boundary examples (normalize before applying the round predicate):** an auth bypass, exposed secret/PII, destructive command without an authority gate, or failed required test/generation/parity gate is **CRITICAL**; a wrong supported response, broken invariant/API/schema, meaningful privacy/authority defect, or unproven behavior-changing fix is **HIGH**; a bounded retry/timeout/alert/testability gap or credible maintainability drift is **MEDIUM**; a typo, formatting inconsistency, optional cleanup, or cosmetic suggestion proven not to affect present behavior is **LOW**. A missing fact about any of those boundaries is **NOT VERIFIABLE** until evidence or an explicitly documented residual-risk decision exists.
>
> **Classification procedure (required for every finding):** (1) state the affected user, system, data, contract, or gate; (2) assess consequence if the issue ships; (3) assess exposure/likelihood and reversibility/detectability; (4) select the highest tier justified by those facts; (5) cite `file:line` or equivalent evidence and a confidence percentage. Effort, implementation cost, reviewer discomfort, and proximity to the round cap are never severity inputs. `NOT VERIFIABLE` is a pending evidence state, not one of the four tiers and never a LOW escape hatch: if the unresolved claim could affect required behavior, security, privacy, authority, availability, data integrity, or a binary gate, it remains an open evidence blocker until resolved or explicitly owner-accepted with documented residual risk. Classify an item LOW only when evidence supports the absence of credible present material impact.
>
> **Hard-gate rule:** Binary gates (tests, required artifacts, security must-fix checks, generated parity, policy compliance) are not ordinary severity-rated findings. The executable helper records a failed gate as a synthetic CRITICAL blocker solely so one predicate can carry it; the report must still name the gate and failure evidence. A failed gate blocks at every round, including when all ordinary findings are LOW; never disguise a failed gate as LOW. A failed non-test gate counts as CRITICAL for the round-3 extension; a failing test gate is outside the round budget and loops until the tests pass.
>
> **Score-based skills** map their numeric scale onto these tiers — do not invent a parallel vocabulary:
>
> - **0-2 criterion scoring** (e.g. production-readiness-review): `0` = CRITICAL/HIGH (criterion unmet, blocks readiness), `1` = MEDIUM (partial, consequential gap), `2` = pass (no finding). If the criterion is only polish, use LOW rather than forcing a `0`.
> - **Two-axis scoring** (e.g. performance-review, impact × likelihood): high impact + high exposure → CRITICAL/HIGH; material impact with bounded exposure → HIGH/MEDIUM; low impact and low exposure → LOW. Record the axes and why the selected tier is the highest credible consequence.
> - **Scorecards / `/20` grades** (e.g. architecture-scalability-review): the aggregate score and verdict band are separate from finding severity. A sub-80 area is evidence to investigate, not an automatic CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW label; classify each underlying gap by the consequence decision tree and keep advisory score deductions separate from blocking findings.
>
> **Domain-vocabulary normalization (mandatory):** Specialized skills may keep a local reporting vocabulary, but it MUST feed this same four-tier round predicate — never a second severity system:
>
> - `BLOCKED`, `HARD FAIL`, or `FAIL` is a blocking local verdict, not an automatic CRITICAL label. Classify the underlying consequence as CRITICAL when it is an immediate material risk or failed binary gate; otherwise classify it as HIGH or MEDIUM with evidence, while preserving the local block until the owning gate is satisfied.
> - `WARN` is not permission to ignore a finding. Map it to MEDIUM when the gap is consequential, to LOW only when evidence supports no credible present material impact, or upward to HIGH/CRITICAL when the consequence warrants it. `PASS`/compliant is not a finding.
> - UI `P0`/`P1`/`P2`/`P3`/`P4` map to CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW/LOW respectively as a starting point; override upward only when the evidence shows a higher shipped consequence. A P0/P1 accessibility or task-completion floor remains a blocking gate even when a local UI report calls it a priority rather than a severity.
> - Numeric SRE/readiness or impact/likelihood scores are evidence inputs, not replacement tiers. Emit the score, the consequence, and the normalized CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW tier together. `INFO`/advisory observations are not findings unless the evidence shows a material consequence.
>
> A finding's tier drives the gate: CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM remain actionable and blocking under the round policy, and only an open CRITICAL/HIGH at round 2 (a failed non-test binary gate counts as CRITICAL) unlocks the single conditional extension round; LOW may be tracked as a follow-up and, from round 2, does not by itself justify another fix/re-review. An owner decision may explain or schedule an open MEDIUM but does not turn it into a clean pass; owner acceptance never makes a failed binary gate pass and must record scope, rationale, and residual risk.

<!-- SYNC:session-goal-ledger -->

> **Session Goal Ledger** — Never lose the user's original request or any later prompt, however long the session runs. Hook-independent: binds every host; a prompt-ledger hook is only an accelerator.
>
> 1. **Pin before acting.** Before the first tool call, write `Original goal: <user's request, verbatim or faithfully condensed>` and keep it as the first task-list item. For workflow or plan work, copy it verbatim into the Goal Contract `## Original Request`.
> 2. **Track every prompt.** Keep `User prompts this session: P1…Pn` — one line per user prompt or input, marked `extends` / `narrows` / `changes` / `answers`. A prompt that changes direction updates the goal explicitly — never silently.
> 3. **Re-anchor.** Re-read the original goal and the prompt list at every workflow step, before delegating (the sub-agent brief carries the verbatim goal), and after compaction, resume, or a `[[prompt-ledger@…]]` reminder. When `tmp/prompt-ledger/<session>/ledger.md` exists it is the durable record — read it after compaction.
> 4. **Verify before done.** Map the final result to the original goal and every prompt: `P# → done | deferred (reason) | not applicable`. An unaddressed prompt blocks completion.
> 5. **Security.** NEVER copy secrets, tokens, or credentials into goal lines, task lists, briefs, or reports — redact them.
>
> **Blocked until:** original goal pinned · prompt list current · final result mapped to every prompt.

<!-- SYNC:workflow-registry-binding -->

> **Workflow ⇄ Registry Two-Way Binding** — a workflow is defined in TWO places that MUST agree: the machine registry `.claude/workflows.json` → `workflows.<workflow-id>`, and this skill's `SKILL.md`. Neither is complete alone. Read BOTH before executing, in this order.
>
> **1. Registry → skill (what the registry owns).** Before the first step, read `.claude/workflows.json` → `workflows.<workflow-id>` and treat it as CANONICAL for:
>
> | Registry field | Governs | Rule |
> | --- | --- | --- |
> | `sequence` | the ordered step list | Execute 1:1. NEVER improvise, reorder, add, or drop a step. |
> | `sequence[].applicability` | every conditional step | `when` is the ONLY run condition; on skip, record `skipReason` VERBATIM as the step's evidence. |
> | `sequence[].args` | step flags | Pass exactly as declared. |
> | `parallelGroups` | all-return barriers | Spawn all members in ONE message; advance only after EVERY member returns. |
> | `stepMeta` | inline vs sub-agent, context budget | Overrides the skill's own front matter. |
> | `preActions.injectContext` | mandatory pre-read context | Apply before step 1. |
> | `variants` / `defaultMode` | mode selection | A variant is a COMPLETE sequence; it inherits nothing from the base. |
>
> **2. Skill → registry (what this SKILL.md owns).** The registry declares WHICH steps run in WHAT order; this SKILL.md declares HOW each step executes — protocols, gates, loops, evidence bars, escalation. Each `sequence[].skill` resolves to `.claude/skills/<skill>/SKILL.md`; the workflow's `preActions.readFiles` names this file as the reverse pointer. Read a step's own SKILL.md before running it.
>
> **3. Precedence on conflict.** Registry WINS on step identity, order, args, applicability, barriers and execution mode. SKILL.md WINS on how to perform a step and on the quality bar it must clear. A genuine contradiction between the two — a step in one and not the other, a different order, or an applicability note whose meaning differs — is DRIFT: note the mismatch in your evidence, continue under the precedence above, and report it when the run ends. NEVER silently pick a side, and NEVER edit one side to match without saying so.
>
> **4. Keep both sides equal when editing either.** Changing a sequence, an occurrence ID, or an `applicability` note in `workflows.json` REQUIRES the matching update in this SKILL.md, and vice versa. Specifically: the `**IMPORTANT MANDATORY Steps:**` line MUST remain a clean `->` chain equal to the registry `sequence` (it is parsed, not prose — annotations there break the gate), any conditional step's note here MUST carry the registry's `skipReason` verbatim, and the step-task table's `Conditional?` column MUST match the presence of `applicability`. After editing either side, re-mirror with `$sync-codex` (`node .claude/skills/sync-codex/scripts/run-codex-sync.mjs`).

<!-- SYNC:project-protocol-overlay -->

> **Project Protocol Overlay** — Before executing this skill, resolve project overlays from the index at `<docsRoots.projectReference.path>/skill-protocols-reference.md` (default `docs/project-reference/`; `docsRoots.projectReference.path` in `docs/project-config.json` overrides it). A matching `referenceDocs[]` filename may relocate the index within that root; this registry is independent from task-specific reference-doc selection, so omitted or empty `referenceDocs` does not disable it. The index's `**Protocols directory:**` header selects a project-root-relative body directory (default `docs/project-protocols/`). Match this skill against the `Target` column and take the most specific tier ONLY — exact name > glob > `*`. **That precedence orders overlays against EACH OTHER, never against this skill.** Read only matched bodies derived as `<protocols-dir>/<Name>.md`; the row's Body link is display text, never a read path. Reject unsafe paths without reading. A matched body that is missing or malformed is REPORTED and skipped — never reconstructed from the index Description. An absent index or no match -> proceed with no overlay, silently. Full contract: `.claude/skills/project-skill-protocol/references/registry.md`.
>
> Overlays are **ADDITIVE ONLY**: they ADD rules on top of this skill's own protocol and NEVER replace, override, disable, or reinterpret a rule it already states — removing every overlay must return this skill to exactly its documented behavior. An overlay is a BRIEF, not an authority escalation: it can NEVER waive a workflow gate, git discipline, a review gate, or a user-confirmation gate. A genuine overlay-vs-skill conflict, or two equally-specific overlays that directly contradict -> surface both to the user; NEVER resolve silently.

**MUST ATTENTION** resolve this skill's overlays from the index at `<docsRoots.projectReference.path>/skill-protocols-reference.md` (default `docs/project-reference/`; overridable in `docs/project-config.json`); an empty task `referenceDocs` does NOT disable this lookup. Read ONLY matched bodies from the directory the index header names (default `docs/project-protocols/`). Specificity (exact > glob > `*`) ranks overlays against EACH OTHER, never against the skill. Missing/malformed body → report and skip; no index or no match → proceed silently.

## Closing Reminders

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION Goal:** [Workflow] Trigger Feature Implementation workflow — implement a well-defined feature with investigation, planning, implementation, and review. This workflow is spec-driven with tests by default: test specs (`$spec [mode=tests]`) are written and reviewed BEFORE implementation (`$plan-execute`), covering former TDD/test-first use cases.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION Main steps:** investigate → spec/clarify → scenario → plan/review/validate → pre-implementation test specs → implement → integration/spec sync → review → optional near-end `workflow-e2e` on explicit request → security/test/docs/demo handoff; large ideas carry embedded decomposition and ordinary runs never create a roadmap file.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION Workflow:** Execute `$investigate` → `$spec-discovery` → `$domain-analysis` → `$why-review` → `$spec` → `$spec-clarify` → `$scenario` → `$plan` → `$plan-review` → `$plan-validate` → `$spec [mode=tests]` → `$artifact-review --type=spec-tests` → `$plan` → `$plan-review` → `$plan-execute` → `$seed-test-data` → `$spec [mode=tests]` → `$artifact-review --type=spec-tests` → `$spec [mode=sync]` → `$integration-test` → `$integration-test-verify` → `$workflow-review-changes` (which owns `$domain-entities-review`, `$integration-test-review`, `$security-review`, the conditional `$scan --target=domain-entities` → `$docs-update` refresh, and `$experience-review`) → optional `$workflow-e2e --source=context` → `$test` → `$demo-guide` → `$workflow-end` → `$watzup`; preserve large-idea decomposition, Goal Contract, spec-drift, UI-intent, performance, and explicit conditional-skip gates.

**Protocols in force (concise digest of the SYNC/shared blocks this skill carries):**

- **End To Start Debugger Trace:** trace observed output backward; matrix hypotheses before fixing.
- **Nested Task Creation:** expand child phases; link parent when nested.
- **Critical Thinking:** trace every claim; confidence >80% to act.
- **AI Mistake Prevention:** verify generated content against evidence, trace downstream references, verify all affected outputs, re-read after context loss, surface ambiguity.
- **Incremental Persistence:** append findings to report file; never hold in memory.
- **Subagent Return Contract:** sub-agents return summary only; NEVER inline full output; report on disk.

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** apply Phase 1 compression before structural enhancement; preserve semantic meaning.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** NEVER alter YAML frontmatter, code blocks, tables, or SYNC-tag bodies during optimization.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** keep evidence gates and mandatory workflow/skill steps explicit and enforceable.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** add a final review task to verify output quality and unresolved risks.

## [LESSON-LEARNED-REMINDER] [BLOCKING] Task Planning & Continuous Improvement — MANDATORY. Do not skip.

Break work into small tasks (task tracking) before starting. Add final task: "Analyze AI mistakes & lessons learned".

**Extract lessons — ROOT CAUSE ONLY, not symptom fixes:**
1. Name the FAILURE MODE (reasoning/assumption failure), not symptom — "assumed API existed without reading source" not "used wrong enum value".
2. Generality test: does this failure mode apply to ≥3 contexts/codebases? If not, abstract one level up.
3. Write as a universal rule — strip project-specific names/paths/classes. Useful on any codebase.
4. Consolidate: multiple mistakes sharing one failure mode → ONE lesson.
5. **Recurrence gate:** "Would this recur in future session WITHOUT this reminder?" — No → skip `$learn`.
6. **Auto-fix gate:** "Could `$code-review`/`$code-simplifier`/`$security-review`/a linter catch this?" — Yes → improve review skill instead.
7. BOTH gates pass → ask user to run `$learn`.
**[CRITICAL-THINKING-MINDSET]** Apply critical thinking, sequential thinking. Every claim needs traced proof, confidence >80% to act.
**Anti-hallucination principle:** Never present guess as fact — cite sources for every claim, admit uncertainty freely, self-check output for errors, cross-reference independently, stay skeptical of own confidence — certainty without evidence root of all hallucination.
**AI Attention principle (Primacy-Recency):** Put the 3 most critical rules at both top and bottom of long prompts/protocols so instruction adherence survives long context windows.
**Goal-driven execution:** Define success criteria first, loop until verified, and stop only when observable checks pass.
**Tests verify intent:** Tests must protect business rules/invariants and fail when the protected intent breaks, not only mirror current behavior.
## Common AI Mistake Prevention (System Lessons)

- **Resolve project applicability before using framework examples.** Read the project config and relevant references, then inspect local evidence; honor explicit N/A and never impose a language, framework, architecture layer, styling method, tool, or runtime surface the project does not use.
- **ROOT-CAUSE GATE — INVESTIGATE FIRST.** Before applying any project-related correction, always use the project's root-cause investigation protocol and establish the cause; the failure site may be only a symptom.
- **FAILED-TEST GATE.** For any failed or unstable test, use the project's test-investigation protocol before editing source or tests; never change either side merely to force green.
- **Re-read files after context compaction.** Edit requires prior Read in same context; compaction wipes read state. Re-read before editing.
- **Grep for old terms after bulk replacements.** AI over-trusts find/replace completeness. Grep full repo after bulk edits for missed refs in docs/configs/catalogs.
- **Check downstream references before deleting.** Deletions cascade doc/code staleness. Map referencing files before removal.
- **After memory loss, check existing state before creating new.** Compaction wipes prior-work memory. Query current state to resume — never blindly duplicate.
- **Verify AI-generated content against actual code.** AI hallucinates APIs, class names, method signatures. Grep to confirm existence before documenting/referencing.
- **Trace full dependency chain after edits.** Changing a definition misses downstream consumers. Trace the full chain.
- **When renaming, grep ALL consumer file types.** Some file types silently ignore missing refs (no compile error). Search code, templates, configs, generated files.
- **Trace ALL code paths when verifying correctness.** Code existing ≠ code executing. Trace early exits, error branches, conditional skips — not just happy path.
- **Update docs that embed canonical data when source changes.** Docs inlining derived data (workflows, schemas, configs) go stale silently. Update all embedding docs alongside source.
- **Verify sub-agent results after context recovery.** Background agents may finish while parent compacted — grep-verify output, don't trust assumed completion.
- **Cross-check full target list against sub-agent assignments.** Parallel sub-agents by category miss boundary items. Reconcile union of assignments against target list before proceeding.
- **Sub-agents inherit knowledge only from their agent .md definition — use custom agent types, not built-in Explore.** Tool adoption = permission + knowledge + enforcement (numbered workflow step).
- **Persist sub-agent findings incrementally, not as a final batch.** Long sub-agents hit cutoffs before final write — findings lost. Instruct append-per-section to report file.
- **Ownership before action.** When investigating a failure, ask which part owns the behavior before changing anything. Trace the wrong state to the component responsible for its invariant, then make one authoritative correction there.
- **Test failure → record a provisional verdict before trace/edit, then investigate.** Use the full five-way taxonomy: SOURCE-WRONG (production violates intent), TEST-WRONG (assertion/setup is stale), TEST-NOT-OPTIMAL (valid but fragile or low-signal test), ENVIRONMENT-BLOCKED (external state prevents a verdict), or AMBIGUOUS (intent/evidence cannot choose safely). Then trace root cause and triangulate against the governing spec if one exists (the business spec root — default `docs/specs`; a `specRoots.business.path` entry in `docs/project-config.json` overrides the path) AND source. NEVER weaken an assertion, add a skip, relax a timeout, or change source merely to force green.
- **Grep ALL removed names after extraction/refactoring.** Primary file "done" ≠ secondary files clean. Grep entire scope for every removed symbol before declaring complete.
- **Assume existing values are intentional — ask WHY before changing OR flagging one as a defect.** Pattern-matching as "wrong" skips context. Before changing or reporting any constant/limit/flag/cutoff: read comments, git blame, the CALLER's ordering (the guarantee that makes the value correct usually lives in code running immediately BEFORE the cited line), and 2+ sibling call sites of the same convention. A doc stating WHAT without WHY is missing rationale, not proof of a missing guard — and in a validation pass, an accurate `file:line` citation proves the transcription, never the defect.
- **Verify ALL affected outputs, not just the first.** One build green ≠ all green. Multi-stack changes (backend/frontend/tests/docs) require verifying EVERY output.
- **Evaluate fit before copying a nearby pattern.** Closest example ≠ matching preconditions — verify the new context shares the same constraints, base classes, scope, lifetime.
- **Holistic analysis — resist the nearest-attention trap.** Do not dive into the first plausible cause. List every precondition (configuration, environment, inputs, dependencies, versions, permissions, and state). Verify each against evidence, not intuition. Ask "what would falsify this?" — if nothing, it is not a hypothesis. The most expensive failure is going deeper into an assumed area while the real issue sits in an unexamined condition.
- **Minimal changes — apply the relevance test.** Every change must trace to the reported problem; avoid unrelated cleanup. For review or enhancement work, announce improvements beyond the main request rather than silently expanding scope. Ask: "Would this change exist if I were not addressing this request?" — if not, remove it or disclose it.
- **Surface ambiguity before coding — don't pick silently.** Multiple valid interpretations → present each with effort: "[Request] could mean (1) [N h], (2) [N h]. Which matters?" List scope/format/volume/constraints assumptions first. If simpler path exists, say so. Never silently pick.
- **Why-Review adversarial mindset — apply when reviewing any plan, decision, or design.** Default SKEPTIC not VALIDATOR: steel-man a rejected alternative, invert each stated reason ("what does it sacrifice?"), stress-test top 2-3 assumptions, run pre-mortem ("ships, fails in 3 months — what breaks?"), surface 1-2 alternatives author missed. Section presence ≠ quality; quality = causal reasoning + concrete mitigations + evidence, not "it's better" or "monitor closely".
- **Front-load report-write in sub-agent prompts for large reviews.** Many-file sub-agents hit budget before final write — findings lost. Design prompts so: (1) report-write is first explicit deliverable, (2) append per-file/section (not batched), (3) scope bounded so reads don't exhaust budget. Truncated mid-sentence with no report file → spawn narrower scope, don't retry same prompt.
- **After context compaction, re-verify all prior phase outcomes before continuing.** Summaries describe intent, not environment state (git index, filesystem, processes). On resume, FIRST audit: git status, re-read modified files, verify filesystem. Every "completed" claim is an untested hypothesis until evidence confirms.
- **OOM/memory: check row count before row size.** Triage: (1) Unbounded query — no DB filter for trigger? Push filter to DB; eliminates OOM. (2) Large rows? Projection reduces proportionally. Row reduction > projection in ROI.
- **Assert the outcome your system OWNS, never the intermediate state your INFRASTRUCTURE owns.** When testing anything asynchronous (queue/broker delivery, retries, background jobs, caches, replication), assert the final business/entity state. NEVER assert the delivery bookkeeping — consume/send status, attempt counts, last-error, row existence or counts in a broker, scheduler, or outbox/inbox table. That bookkeeping lives in shared infrastructure that ANY co-running process (a peer worker, a second replica, a leftover local container) can write, usually under a deterministic shared key, so the assertion silently tests the developer's environment instead of the system: green when run alone, flaky the instant anything else shares that broker + database. Gate question for every assertion: "would this hold no matter WHICH process did the work?" — if no, assert the converged data state instead. Corollary: process-local fault injection and in-process telemetry cannot gate work any process may perform — use them as stress amplifiers (arm → bounded window → disarm → assert convergence), never as preconditions.
- **Store disposable generated output in the project workspace.** If an output can be regenerated and is not source code, a canonical source-of-truth, or an intentionally versioned projection, write it under the project-root `tmp/` or `temp/` directory (prefer `tmp/`), scoped to the run. This includes temporary state, integration/E2E results, reports, logs, screenshots, traces, videos, coverage, dumps, and candidate evidence. Never put these outputs in source, docs, the plans root (default `plans/`; a `docsRoots.plans.path` entry in `docs/project-config.json` overrides the path), the team-artifacts root (default `team-artifacts/`; `docsRoots.teamArtifacts.path` in the same config overrides the path), or mirror directories; the project-root `.gitignore` must ignore `/tmp/` and `/temp/` by default. Committed fixtures, accepted baselines, canonical specs/docs, and explicitly versioned generated mirrors remain at their declared owner paths.
- **Judge the environment before judging the code — a competing hypothesis, not a fallback.** A bug, failed test, error, or odd output is NOT proof of a code defect. Before deep tracing and before any verdict, sweep environment preconditions (toolchain/dependency/lockfile state, stale build or cache artifacts, env vars and config profile, service dependencies up-migrated-seeded, ports/network/clock, OS-path/locale, permissions and locks, leftover processes/containers/test data) AND transient resource pressure (RAM/OOM, CPU saturation under parallel workers, disk/temp exhaustion, handle and connection-pool limits, network flakiness, a timeout that is really slowness). Tell-tale shape: non-deterministic, timing-dependent, passes alone but fails in parallel, fails only on one machine or only on CI, or an error naming resources rather than business rules. Cite the discriminator you ran (clean environment? did code on the failing path change since it last passed? one machine or all? concurrency 1 or a clean rebuild?) — a verdict without one is a guess, for code as much as for the environment. Fix an environment cause in the environment or setup; NEVER edit product code or weaken/skip a test to absorb it, and a failure that vanishes on retry stays unexplained until its mechanism is named. — why: forcing green against an environment fault hides the real defect and permanently rots the test.
- **Cross-platform execution is a required contract.** Before authoring or changing a tool, script, process launcher, path assertion, or filesystem test, name the supported Windows, macOS, and Linux behaviors. Use platform-neutral Node APIs and literal argv vectors; never infer shell, temporary-path, executable-extension, ACL, or symlink semantics from the current host. Canonicalize existing paths before identity, hashing, or equality checks; test native Windows and POSIX seams when behavior differs; keep CI platform matrices authoritative. Preserve fail-closed security boundaries — repair the fixture or platform branch, never weaken the guard just to make one OS green.
- **Keep domain concepts out of generic/shared/infrastructure layers.** Reusable layer (shared library, framework, infra module) must reference NO consumer-specific domain concept — tenant/customer/product IDs, business entities, feature rules. Leak compiles + runs → passes review silently while coupling the "reusable" layer to one consumer. Keep shared type domain-free; push domain fields/logic down into the consumer via subclass/composition. — why: a layer coupled to one consumer's domain is no longer reusable.
