> - Host-native execution: Codex runs a skill by loading its `SKILL.md` instructions and executing the required steps with available tools. No separate `Skill` tool is required; a loaded skill is already activated.
> - Source vs execution: prefer the registered `.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` for Codex execution. `.claude/**` remains the canonical authoring source; reading it for a registry or source inspection does not switch this session to Claude Code.
> - Capability check: interpret Claude tool names through the active host before declaring a blocker. Continue when Codex can perform the required operation; stop and ask only when the actual capability is unavailable, naming the step and evidence. Host-native execution is not a protocol deviation and needs no extra approval.

> - Subagent authorization: when a skill is user-invoked or AI-detected and its protocol requires subagents, that skill activation authorizes use of the required `spawn_agent` subagent(s) for that task.
> - Do not skip, reorder, or merge protocol steps unless the user explicitly approves the deviation first.
> - For workflow skills, steps follow the guided contract in `$start-workflow` (gate steps fixed; other steps may flex with a logged reason); report step-by-step evidence.

## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Research a topic from web sources and deliver ONE cited, reviewed artifact in the form `--output` selects: a knowledge report (`synthesis`, default), a business/market viability evaluation (`business-eval`), a marketing strategy (`marketing`), or course material (`course`). The workflow produces research artifacts only, never code.

**Use it when** the answer must come from external sources and end in a durable, cited deliverable. **Use a sibling instead** for a quick lookup with no artifact (plain `$web-research`) or for questions about this codebase (`$investigate`).

**IMPORTANT MANDATORY Steps:** resolve the `workflow-research` manifest variant for `--output` first, then create one task per returned occurrence (the research occurrence runs `$web-research --chain=deep-dive`) (default: $web-research -> $knowledge-synthesis -> $knowledge-review -> $workflow-end -> $watzup).

**Step contract:** steps follow `$start-workflow` → Step Execution Protocol — `gate` steps always run, a step that runs invokes its skill invocation, and every other deviation is logged. NEVER batch-complete validation gates.

This skill is the canonical Research & Synthesis entry point. Invoke it with `--output=<mode>` (default `synthesis`); `$start-workflow workflow-research` resolves the same variants through `.claude/scripts/lib/workflow-manifest.cjs`. Each variant is a complete sequence, so execute the resolved manifest and never a hand-swapped list.

## Output Modes (--output)

Pick the mode from the prompt BEFORE creating tasks. When the prompt is ambiguous, use `synthesis` and state the assumption. Every mode shares one research step, `$web-research --chain=deep-dive` (source map, then evidence base; the `$source-deep-dive` procedure runs inside it per `.claude/skills/web-research/references/research-chain.md`), and the `$knowledge-review → $workflow-end → $watzup` close; only the terminal synthesis skill(s) differ.

| `--output`              | Deliverable                          | Terminal synthesis skill(s)                 |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| **synthesis** (default) | Cited knowledge report               | `$knowledge-synthesis`                      |
| **business-eval**       | Business/market viability evaluation | `$market-analysis` → `$business-evaluation` |
| **marketing**           | Marketing strategy                   | `$market-analysis` → `$strategy-builder`    |
| **course**              | Structured course material           | `$course-builder`                           |

**[BLOCKING] Evidence-artifact identity for `business-eval` and `marketing`:** before invoking the
first research child, derive one stable `ARTIFACT_SLUG` from the user's topic and record the exact
`MARKET_ANALYSIS_PATH = docs/knowledge/strategy/market-analysis/{ARTIFACT_SLUG}.md` in the parent
workflow context/task handoff. Pass those exact values to every child skill. `market-analysis` is the
only producer; it must write and return that path, and `business-evaluation`/`strategy-builder` must
read that exact path rather than deriving a second slug. If a plan directory is active, its
`{plan-dir}/research/market-analysis.md` file is a copy of the same producer artifact, not a second
identity. This token is not needed for `synthesis` or `course` variants. — why: sequence ordering
without a shared artifact key still allows a producer/consumer miss that degrades the final evidence
without failing the workflow.

## Question-Scope Triage (first action)

Classify the question and record it in the workflow report. Scope sets research DEPTH inside the research step's caps (≤10 searches, then ≤8 fetches); it never lowers the evidence bar.

| Scope                          | Signals                                                                           | Depth                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Narrow**                     | One fact, definition, or comparison of 2–3 named options                          | 3–5 angle-varied queries; fetch the 2–4 strongest Tier 1–2 sources; a short artifact that still carries every template section the review enforces.                                                                    |
| **Standard**                   | One topic with several angles                                                     | Skill defaults: 5–10 queries, 5–8 fetches.                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **Broad or decision-critical** | Multi-part topic, contested evidence, or a business/strategy decision rides on it | Split into sub-topics, one bounded research pass per sub-topic (each under the caps), then merge the source maps and evidence bases before synthesis. Run the adversarial checks of `$knowledge-review` at full depth. |

## Orchestration

You choose inline vs sub-agent, batching and ordering to minimize wall-clock and tokens at equal quality. Narrow questions run inline. For broad questions, independent sub-topic research passes can run as one parallel wave, because each writes only its own source and evidence files. Merge them before synthesis.

Fixed data dependencies: inside the research step the source map exists before the deep dive; the evidence base exists before synthesis; `market-analysis` writes `MARKET_ANALYSIS_PATH` before its consumer reads it; `$knowledge-review` checks the final artifact; `$workflow-end` runs last.

## Memory & Reporting

- Create one task per resolved occurrence. Child skills expand their own phases under the parent row.
- Create the workflow report FIRST at `tmp/reports/workflow-research-{YYMMDD}-{HHmm}-{slug}.md`: mode, triage, resolver fingerprint, per-step evidence and deviations, and the paths of the source map, evidence base and final artifact. Append after each step.
- Sub-agent briefs carry the topic, the slug, the exact paths and the evidence bar, and make report writing the first deliverable.
- After compaction, re-read the current task list and the workflow report before continuing.

## Evidence Retention

Retain this run’s source map and evidence base during synthesis, all review rounds, and owner repairs. Cleanup is an orchestrator lifecycle action after `$knowledge-review` returns APPROVED on the final artifact and `$workflow-end` successfully accepts closure; record the acceptance evidence and exact removed paths in the workflow report. REVISE, BLOCKED, interruption, or closure failure retains the inputs. Remove only this run’s `_sources-{slug}.md` and `_evidence-{slug}.md` if its retention policy permits; never erase another run’s evidence. Cleanup after closure is report housekeeping, not another workflow occurrence.

## Findings & Fix Path

- `$knowledge-review` is read-only. Validate each REVISE/BLOCKED finding against the evidence, then fix it at its owner. An evidence gap takes a targeted `$source-deep-dive` pass over the existing source map, or a `$web-research --chain=deep-dive` pass on the gap when the map lacks the needed sources. A synthesis defect (missing section, uncited claim, miscalibrated confidence) is fixed in the artifact through its synthesis skill. Then re-run `$knowledge-review` on the fixed artifact.
- Loop bounds: round 1 exits on zero open findings (Round-1 LOW closure); from round 2 the bar is zero CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM, with LOWs deferred and listed; cap 3 review rounds; escalate by asking the user directly when a round makes no progress.

> **Protocol guides** — A hook delivers each protocol's full text when this skill loads. If a protocol's text is not in your context, read its file below before you act on it.

- `incremental-persistence` — Persist results per file or section while the work proceeds; a sub-agent or heavy step processes more than three files → .claude/skills/shared/protocols/incremental-persistence.md

## Closing Reminders

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION Goal:** one cited, reviewed artifact in the selected `--output` form, with `$knowledge-review` converged and every factual claim traceable to a Sources row.

- **MUST ATTENTION** select the `--output` mode and triage the question scope FIRST. Scope sets research depth inside the skill caps; it never lowers the citation or cross-validation bar.
- **MUST ATTENTION** for `business-eval` and `marketing`, derive one `ARTIFACT_SLUG` and `MARKET_ANALYSIS_PATH` before the first research step and pass the exact values to every child.
- **MUST ATTENTION** fix validated review findings at their owner (evidence gap → targeted `$source-deep-dive` or `$web-research --chain=deep-dive` pass, synthesis defect → the artifact), then re-run `$knowledge-review`.
- **MUST ATTENTION Variant closure:** record the selected `--output` mode, resolver fingerprint, ordered occurrence IDs, each invoked skill's evidence, and every deviation before `$workflow-end`; a variant mismatch is a workflow failure.
