## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Select, generate, and maintain E2E tests on the project's configured framework with mandatory profile-resolved owner/case↔test/assertion traceability, producing a suite that runs, repeats deterministically, and maps every test to accepted intent. Use TC/§8 only when no native `specArtifacts` profile is declared.

**Summary:**

- Read the project E2E reference + config FIRST — detect the framework (Playwright/Cypress/Selenium) and optional `e2eTesting.execution` profile before writing anything. Prompt/current-context generation uses the same config-first contract; never invent setup from a generic browser default.
- Every test maps configured requirement/acceptance references and its owner-qualified scenario/case ID/variant to the actual executor(s), assertion(s), and result(s), respecting profile cardinality. Use the configured `specArtifacts` identifiers/carriers; when no native profile exists, the strict default requires `TC-{MODULE}-E2E-{NNN}` and §8/Test Specifications.
- Apply the shared `.claude/skills/shared/e2e-quality-protocol.md` before writing or updating a test; record the scenario and invariant in the project's declared test format, plus applicable ownership, isolation, auth, evidence, cleanup, and spec-traceability rows.
- Follow the configured project organization for locators/actions; use page/component objects only when the project contract or established reuse calls for them. Derive stable selectors from accessible or stable data/DOM contracts, never positional/generated ones, and keep final behavior assertions visible in the test.
- Deterministic runs — isolate mutable test data using the project's supported setup; use unique identities when shared state makes collisions possible. Follow the configured runner's native waits or an evidenced project helper for applicable readiness and outcomes. Apply action pacing only when the project contract configures it, and use the auth path the project declares; after fixing failures, record evidence-backed learning in the E2E reference doc.
- Reusable E2E architecture — follow the project's configured ownership boundaries. Scoped test-local locators, behavior helpers, and page/component objects are alternatives selected from the project contract and existing examples; use cohesive helpers, a single owner for shared selectors/actions/waits, and abstraction only where the convention or demonstrated reuse warrants it.
- Visual review is enabled only when requested or required by the project contract for an applicable visual surface; there is no framework-wide screenshot default. Follow the configured `uiStateCapture.mode` (default `declared-only`): capture the declared matrix when visual review applies, record transition blind spots under `declared-only`, and add transition captures only under opted-in `every-action` when a verified shared boundary exists. `off` disables transition captures, not a visual gate required by the project. Index and preserve required captures as candidate evidence for `/experience-review`; never promote a baseline automatically.
- Apply `.claude/skills/shared/ui-state-capture-protocol.md` to the project's selected capture mode. Add a `captureUiState(actionDescriptor)` integration at an existing shared action boundary only when the project selects `every-action`; otherwise use its established matrix-capture and evidence pattern. Do not add page-object or base-class architecture solely to host capture. Cover applicable states and actions declared by the project; follow its capture caps, masking, and full-page policy, and never dedupe or cap a failure capture when the contract excludes it.

**Workflow:**

1. **Read project E2E docs** — `docs/project-reference/e2e-test-reference.md`, `docs/project-config.json`
2. **Resolve execution profile** — link `e2eTesting.execution.surfaceIds[]` to `experienceVerification.surfaces[]`; use linked `localRun` for lifecycle and profile fields for auth/data/browser/evidence/convergence.
3. **Detect framework** — Resolve the runner and configuration from project config and repository evidence; use its documented automated or visible human-QC entry point when applicable.
4. **Load or derive intent** — resolve the canonical owner root from `specRoots.business.path` and requirement/acceptance/scenario IDs, carriers, cardinality, and evidence sections from optional `specArtifacts`; when no native profile exists, use default TC/§8. If owner or case identity is unknown, record it unresolved and do not claim coverage.
5. **Select or generate/update tests** — follow the organization declared by project config/reference and confirmed by representative cases; preserve suitable coverage and create page/component objects only when configured or justified by demonstrated reuse.
6. **Run tests and inspect evidence** — project's configured commands, exact counts/exit status, redacted screenshots/logs/traces/video when configured.
7. **Update docs** — add evidence-backed learnings to `e2e-test-reference.md` inside the reference-docs root (default `docs/project-reference`; a `docsRoots.projectReference.path` entry in `docs/project-config.json` overrides the path)

**Key Rules:**

- **AI surface?** Only if the journey exercises a model call, prompt, agent, tool/MCP, retrieval or eval (see `node .claude/scripts/ai-signal-scan.cjs`): read `.claude/skills/shared/protocols/ai-engineering-gate.md`; stub the model at one seam and assert outcomes, not exact prose; no live paid calls in default CI (`AE-6`); otherwise skip this line.
- NEVER fabricate file paths, function names, or behavior — investigate first, then act — why: a hallucinated selector or path passes review and fails only at runtime
- MUST ATTENTION map every test to the configured owner-qualified case identity and actual assertion/result; use TC (`TC-{MODULE}-E2E-{NNN}`) only under the strict default profile — why: traceability proves which accepted behavior the test protects
- For browser locators, prefer accessible role/name, labels, or platform accessibility identifiers; next use configured stable test hooks, then documented project-owned locators or meaningful text. Styling classes are not semantic controls; avoid generated/positional selectors and XPath unless the project documents a reviewed exception — why: user-facing locators survive unrelated style and markup changes.
- Treat changed visual output as candidate evidence; replace visual baselines ONLY after inspection and an explicit `HUMAN-ACCEPTED` record through `/experience-review`. Preserve the previous accepted baseline while acceptance is missing, ambiguous, rejected, or environment-blocked — why: an unaccepted change must not redefine the regression expectation.
- MUST ATTENTION read the project E2E reference BEFORE any E2E work — why: local conventions override generic framework defaults
- Never infer a startup command, account, seed, port, selector, browser dependency, or evidence path. Discover it from the project contract/repository and report `ENVIRONMENT-BLOCKED` when required capability is missing.

> **Evidence Gate** — Every claim, finding, and recommendation requires `file:line` proof or traced evidence. Confidence >80% to act; <80% must verify first. NEVER speculate without proof.
> **External Memory** — For complex or lengthy work (research, analysis, scan, review), write intermediate findings and final results to a report file in `tmp/reports/` — prevents context loss.

## MANDATORY: Read Project E2E Reference (FIRST)

> **E2E Skill** — Detect runner, organization, and canonical case identity from config/reference and representative cases; follow the local locator/action pattern, with page/component objects only when configured or justified by demonstrated reuse. Preserve owner-qualified case-to-actual-assertion/result traceability (TC/§8 only under the strict default profile), state isolation appropriate to the test, and the project's native or configured wait strategy. MUST ATTENTION READ `.claude/skills/e2e-test/SKILL.md` for the detailed workflow.
> **Shared quality protocol** — MUST ATTENTION READ `.claude/skills/shared/e2e-quality-protocol.md` before authoring; its GWT/invariant and quality-gate rows are the same contract consumed by E2E writing, verification, convergence, and experience review.

**BEFORE ANY E2E WORK — run these, then act on results:**

```bash
head -100 docs/project-reference/e2e-test-reference.md  # Project-specific patterns
grep -A 50 '"e2eTesting"' docs/project-config.json       # Framework, paths, commands
grep -A 20 '"specRoots"' docs/project-config.json        # Canonical owner root
# Resolve optional specArtifacts identifiers, ownership, carriers, and evidence sections too.
# Only without a native specArtifacts profile, find default TC cases under the resolved owner root:
grep -r "TC-.*-E2E-" <resolved-business-spec-root>
```

If `e2eTesting.execution` exists, also resolve its `surfaceIds[]`, auth/data,
browser, evidence, and convergence fields and read the linked
`experienceVerification.surfaces[].localRun` recipe. Missing or partial facts
must be recorded as discovery work or `ENVIRONMENT-BLOCKED`, never filled with
generic Playwright defaults.

**When fixing E2E failures, MUST ATTENTION update `e2e-test-reference.md` — inside the reference-docs root (default `docs/project-reference`; a `docsRoots.projectReference.path` entry in `docs/project-config.json` overrides the path) — with learnings; why: the next run starts from the lesson, not the same failure.**

## Capabilities

| Mode             | Input                      | Output                       |
| ---------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `from-recording` | Browser recording + spec   | Test file + artifacts required by the project's configured organization |
| `update-ui`      | Git diff of UI changes     | Updated screenshot baselines |
| `from-changes`   | Changed test specs or code | Updated test implementations |
| `from-spec`      | Configured owner-qualified case IDs and carriers | New tests matching accepted intent |
| `from-prompt-context` | User prompt or current context | Project-format scenario record and test artifacts mapped to a named invariant |

When visual review is requested or required, each mode above produces evidence according to the configured capture mode and project contract. `declared-only` captures the matrix; opted-in `every-action` adds transitions through a verified shared boundary; `off` disables transition capture only. Index required captures in the configured manifest for `/experience-review` to adjudicate case by case.

## Framework Detection

```bash
# TypeScript/JavaScript
grep -l "playwright\|cypress\|selenium\|webdriver" package.json 2>/dev/null
ls playwright.config.* cypress.config.* wdio.conf.* 2>/dev/null

# C# .NET
grep -r "Selenium.WebDriver\|Microsoft.Playwright" **/*.csproj 2>/dev/null
```

| Framework    | Config File          | Test Extension | Run Command           |
| ------------ | -------------------- | -------------- | --------------------- |
| Playwright   | playwright.config.ts | \*.spec.ts     | `npx playwright test` |
| Cypress      | cypress.config.ts    | \*.cy.ts       | `npx cypress run`     |
| WebdriverIO  | wdio.conf.js         | \*.e2e.ts      | `npx wdio run`        |

## Core Principles

### Profile-Resolved Case Traceability (MANDATORY)

- Resolve the canonical owner from `specRoots.business.path` and requirement/acceptance/scenario/case identity from optional `specArtifacts.identifiers`, `ownership`, and `carriers`; include the configured variant when applicable.
- Map each owner-qualified identity to its actual executing test/case(s), assertion(s) protecting accepted intent, configured evidence section/carrier, and exact run result(s), respecting profile cardinality. A title match alone is insufficient when the declared profile requires owner/carrier evidence.
- Unknown/missing owner, ID, evidence, executor, or assertion remains unresolved `UNVERIFIED`, never `PASS`; never invent IDs or create a parallel case registry. When no native profile is declared, use the strict default TC/§8/Test Specifications contract.

The following example is **only for the strict default profile when no native `specArtifacts` profile is declared**; otherwise follow the configured identifier and carrier.

```typescript
// Default-profile example only
test('TC-LR-E2E-001: Submit leave request', async () => { ... });
```

### Test organization and locator/action ownership

- Read the configured E2E reference and config, then inspect comparable tests, helpers, and page/component objects where present. Follow and record the explicit local organization with its evidence; a configured object path identifies a location and does not alone require a Page Object Model.
- Keep each locator and interaction in the owner established by that pattern. A scenario-local scoped locator is suitable for one-off use; use a shared helper or object when the convention calls for it or repeated behavior has a clear reusable owner.
- If no organization is declared, keep one-off locators in the test and extract a small helper/object only when demonstrated reuse gives it a clear owner.
- Add page/component objects, layered ownership, or a base abstraction only when configured or supported by concrete reuse. Do not add empty wrappers or tiers solely to satisfy a generic taxonomy.
- Keep final business-outcome assertions in the test so the protected behavior remains visible.

### Selector Strategy (Priority Order)

1. Accessible semantics or platform accessibility identifiers that express the control
2. Project-configured stable test hooks or data attributes (for example, `data-testid`)
3. Other documented stable selectors or meaningful visible text where appropriate

**AVOID:** generated classes, positional selectors (`:nth-child`), or XPath unless the project documents a reviewed need.

### Test Data & Repeatability

- Isolate mutable/shared test data using the project-supported fixture or data strategy; use unique IDs when needed to prevent collisions, and never depend on unverified ambient database state.
- Use the configured runner's native waits or an evidenced project helper for readiness/actionability and expected outcomes; NEVER use arbitrary sleep as readiness. Apply post-action pacing only when the project contract configures it; it must not replace an assertion, wait, postcondition, or real settle signal.
- Follow the project's declared auth fixture/session strategy; do not require shared login state or bypass a real authentication path without project evidence.
- Document preconditions (infrastructure, seed data, feature configs) — why: an undocumented precondition is a silent prerequisite the next runner can't satisfy

## Output

E2E test report: prompt/current-context scope, project-format scenario record + protected
invariant, files created/modified, whether existing coverage was reused,
owner-qualified case/variant IDs and requirement/acceptance references mapped to
configured evidence sections/carriers and actual executor/assertion/results
(TC/§8 only under the strict default profile; unresolved mappings are
`UNVERIFIED`), resolved project-config profile, run command, exact counts and
exit status, evidence/redaction references, preconditions, and any
`N/A`/`ENVIRONMENT-BLOCKED`/`ACCEPTANCE-PENDING` limitation.

In visual mode the report also names: the resolved `--visual-review` value and
`uiStateCapture.mode`, the trigger set instrumented and where the capture helper
was wired (N/A under `off`), the manifest path and row count, caps/sampling/dedupe
applied with any escalation for untaken captures, and the state-changing actions
that produced no capture (a single `N/A — uiStateCapture off: {reason}` under `off`).
A captured-but-unindexed image, or an applicable UI surface with no capture
capability, is `ENVIRONMENT-BLOCKED` — never a pass.

> **Test-Failure Fault Adjudication** — When a test fails (or you are debugging or fixing a failure), the job is to determine *who is at fault — the source code or the test code*. Getting that verdict right matters more than turning the suite green. Binds every debug / fix / test skill identically.
>
> 1. **Provisional verdict before touching either side.** Classify the observed evidence as SOURCE-WRONG, TEST-WRONG, TEST-NOT-OPTIMAL, ENVIRONMENT-BLOCKED, or AMBIGUOUS; then `/investigate --mode=debug` and trace end-to-start before editing. A green-again suite is NOT the goal.
> 2. **Triangulate against the owner artifact AND the source.** Use the business root selected by `specRoots.business.path`, following the framework config loader's fallback only when the project leaves it unset. Resolve `specArtifacts`: when valid, read its configured `intent/contracts/evidence` sections and locate native cases through configured carriers; when absent, use the strict-default §3 AC / §4 BR / §5 invariant / §8 TC sections. A malformed or unsupported declaration blocks without fallback. Inspect the assertion tied to owner + case/scenario ID + optional variant. The canonical intent decides expected behavior — compare BOTH production source and failing test against it. With no spec, use documented intent / acceptance criteria / caller contract and name that limit. Decide from evidence whether SOURCE or TEST is wrong.
> 3. **Classify who is at fault, then fix the wrong side at its root:**
>     - **SOURCE-WRONG** — production code violates the spec's intended behavior or a clear invariant → fix the source at the owning layer; keep or strengthen the test that caught it.
>     - **TEST-WRONG** — the test encodes a stale or incorrect assertion, setup, or expectation that contradicts intended behavior → fix the test at its root. NEVER weaken an assertion, add a skip, or relax a timeout to force green.
>     - **TEST-NOT-OPTIMAL** — intended behavior is valid but the test seam, timing, or assertion signal is fragile → improve the test without weakening the invariant.
>     - **ENVIRONMENT-BLOCKED** — infrastructure, setup, or external state — including transient resource pressure (RAM/OOM, CPU saturation, disk or temp exhaustion, handle and connection-pool limits, network flakiness, a timeout that is really slowness) — prevents a source/test verdict → preserve diagnostics (exact command, exit code, full output, resource evidence), name the environment remedy, and STOP mutating source or tests until the environment is healthy. This verdict is a FIRST-CLASS candidate weighed in step 1 alongside SOURCE-WRONG and TEST-WRONG — never a fallback reached only after the code looks fine; run `SYNC:environment-fault-hypothesis` to rule it in or out with a stated discriminator. A failure that vanishes on retry stays UNEXPLAINED until its mechanism is named — "flaky" is a symptom, not a verdict.
>     - **AMBIGUOUS** — evidence or intended behavior does not safely select an owner → ask the user or canonical owner before editing.
>     - NEVER change a test to match broken source, and NEVER change source to satisfy a broken test. (Migration code excluded — schema/data migrations are one-time execution paths, not core application logic.)
> 4. **Ask the user when intended behavior is unclear.** If no owner artifact covers the behavior, the configured sections are silent, or the owner is ambiguous about which side is correct, STOP and ask the user or canonical spec owner before editing either side — never silently pick source or test just to make the suite pass.
>
> Reconcile to intended behavior, never to whichever side currently passes — green can encode the very bug.
>
> **Read-only/report-only role boundary:** when this block is carried by a report-only role (`code-reviewer`, `spec-compliance-reviewer`, `tester`, and any other agent whose definition declares it never edits source), "fix the wrong side" means RETURN the adjudicated verdict and the proposed repair to the parent — do not modify source, tests, generated carriers, or user data. The adjudication is the deliverable; the edit is the caller's. Without this sentence the block's step-3 imperatives read as write authority and directly contradict those agents' own declarations (e.g. `tester.md` "NEVER implement fixes").

Bound custom waits and include useful diagnostics; do not require a helper API or object model the project does not use.
> 2b. **Observe → act → observe.** After an action, wait for the expected positive or negative postcondition before the next dependent action, using observable state and the configured runner. Keep the final business assertion in the test. A timeout is a test failure with diagnostics, not permission to weaken the assertion.
> 3. **Wait on a real signal, never a blind sleep.** Find an observable proving the prior step finished — a persisted state change, an audit/version stamp, a queue/worker idle marker, a completion event — and poll until it settles (unchanged across a short stability window). Use a fixed delay ONLY when no observable exists, and say so in a comment. A browser action delay MUST never replace a readiness/actionability wait.
> 4. **Barriers belong in ARRANGE, never in ASSERT.** Waiting for a precondition is fidelity. Widening an assertion's timeout, loosening a comparison, adding a retry around a failing assertion, or skipping the test is masking. NEVER do the latter to force green.
> 5. **Distinguish harness-amplified from real.** Test topologies (shared infra, fan-out consumers, parallel suites, cold starts) can make a rare production race routine locally. Before filing a product defect, state whether the trigger exists in production and at what likelihood.
> 6. **Keep the protected invariant intact.** Improving fidelity must NEVER reduce what the test protects. If a realistic scenario no longer exercises the rule, the rule needs a DIFFERENT realistic scenario — not a weaker assertion.
> 7. **Deliberate impossible-state tests are allowed, but MUST be labelled.** Corruption-repair, migration, and fail-safe tests intentionally construct states production should never reach; comment WHY the state is reachable (upstream bug, partial write, legacy data), so they are never confused with unrealistic setups.
> 8. **Visible browser evidence is part of fidelity.** When the project contract calls for human-QC on a web surface, use its configured visible browser runner or control path when supported; attach runtime/network listeners before interaction and capture/read the configured screenshots, traces, or video. Follow the runner's native waits or an evidenced bounded project helper, and redact sensitive evidence. An unread artifact is not an observation.

<!-- SYNC:test-architecture-execution-contract -->

> **Test Architecture & Execution Contract** — Treat testability as a setup/architecture acceptance condition. Identify the test types and execution modes required by the project contract and task risk (for example unit, integration/system, E2E, performance/scale). Record `APPLICABLE` only with evidence of a relevant runner/framework/configuration; otherwise record `N/A — <evidence>` and never fabricate coverage or impose a universal tier threshold.
>
> 0. **Make the protected intent explicit in the project's test format.** Every assertion-bearing test states the behavior or technical invariant it protects and makes its inputs, trigger, and owned outcome understandable. Use `Given / When / Then` when the project's spec/config selects it or it fits; otherwise keep the project's native organization (property/fuzz tests describe the input space and property; harness and mutation tests use their native contract). Do not rewrite a test solely to adopt a framework-wide syntax.
>    Link the case to the configured owner/case/scenario identity and its `intent` or `contracts` role when `specArtifacts` is valid; when absent, record `Business Intent / Invariant Guarded` (or the technical contract). A malformed declared profile blocks without fallback. One behavior per case. The final assertion proves the outcome the test owns, not only an internal call, delivery bookkeeping, or setup side effect. Fixture/runner glue is exempt only when it holds no assertion. Convert legacy brownfield cases when touched; a broader migration is a named owned opportunity, and a safety-critical case without clear phases is `BLOCKED`.
>
> 1. **Matrix before implementation:** for each required test type record applicability, owner, runner/framework, test root, fixture/data strategy, full command, focused/partial command, zero-match behavior, CI gate, a simple entry point when useful, each supported execution mode, and the environments the project promises to support.
> 1a. **E2E profile handoff:** also record the selected `surfaceIds[]`, the linked `localRun` owner, auth mode/reference, seed/data mode, browser runner/engine/headed setting, action-delay policy, evidence root/capture/redaction policy, and convergence cap. Missing fields stay explicit blockers or N/A; never fill them from generic browser defaults.
> 2. **Runnable scopes:** full and focused commands are copy-ready, fail on invalid or zero-match selections, report exact counts and exit status, and are safe to repeat. E2E uses the configured browser/service commands and the project's synchronization strategy.
> 2a. **E2E organization gate (when E2E is applicable):** reuse the configured/discovered test organization — fixtures, shared helpers, scoped locator handles, page objects, or another evidenced structure — and record its actual owners. A Page Object Model is one valid pattern, never a universal requirement.
> 2b. **E2E reuse and DRY gate:** keep shared lifecycle, locator, readiness, auth, data, and evidence behavior at the project's existing reusable owner and final outcome assertions in the test. Reuse or compose existing helpers before creating new ones, keep one canonical owner per selector/action/wait, and treat duplicated wrappers or setup as a review signal; extract when a shared owner reduces change cost without crossing project boundaries.
> 2c. **E2E test layering:** test reusable behavior at its actual owner where the harness supports it; feature tests cover user outcomes and local composition. Do not invent component tiers or lower-tier contract tests the project does not use.
> 2d. **E2E synchronization:** wait for observable readiness and outcome conditions with bounded runner-native waits or the configured helper, with useful timeout diagnostics; apply action delays only when the project contract specifies them, and never use fixed sleeps as readiness evidence.
> 3. **Fresh valid state (when mutable or shared state applies):** isolate each test/run through the project's supported setup and public paths. Use unique identities for shared mutable data, realistic valid data for the behavior under test, and idempotent/restart-safe setup when fixtures or seeders persist. Intentional accumulation is additive and integrity-checked; never hide contamination with destructive reset.
>    Run-scoped cleanup, when supported, is opt-in and idempotent: after evidence capture it removes only ephemeral resources owned by the current run — never persistent/additive data or another run's data, never a shared-state reset, never a substitute for no-reset proof.
> 4. **Isolation and fidelity:** isolate mutable/shared data and parallel workers; share only immutable/reference data. Use realistic input and observable arrange barriers where behavior depends on them. Do not widen retries or weaken assertions to make a scenario pass.
> 5. **Evidence gate:** report command, scope, identity/data mode, exact result, and repeat proof; for persistent-state suites, verify repeatability without destructive reset at the level the project gate requires. Line coverage is diagnostic only; use property/invariant, mutation, change, or behavior signals when the tooling supports them.
> 6. **Execution modes and environment reach:** exercise each mode and environment the project declares it supports (for example host/container or local/CI), parameterizing targets rather than maintaining needless forks; record unexercised declared capabilities as a gap. A production-shaped target applies only when the project requires it; tests that can reach production need an enforced safe scope and report `ENVIRONMENT-BLOCKED` when it is missing. Pin dependencies and declare external prerequisites where the reproducibility contract requires. Depth → `SYNC:engineering-foundation-gate` **F1/F2/F3**.
>
> **Ownership:** Architecture/harness defines the matrix; scaffold/workflow makes it runnable; test writers implement tier-specific cases; reviewers verify the contract; the runner reports; seed-data owners preserve uniqueness, idempotency, realism, and accumulation integrity. Missing required evidence blocks setup completion.

> **E2E Visual Design Contract** — Binds when this skill or agent handles visual-review evidence, human-QC of a user-facing visual surface, or visual expectation/baseline updates; for non-visual E2E/API/CLI work state `N/A — no user-facing visual surface` and do not invent a design review.
>
> 1. **Resolve authority first.** Read `docs/project-config.json`, its docs index, and the applicable project references for design, accessibility, platform, styling, and components; consult `.claude/docs/design-knowledge.md` and `.claude/docs/design-review-checklist.md` when they apply. Record `N/A` only for a proven absent surface or `ENVIRONMENT-BLOCKED` for an applicable missing configured capability — never invent tokens, components, breakpoints, type, styling conventions, or runner defaults.
> 2. **Use project decisions.** Apply precedence: brief/accepted design contract → adopter project design-system/SCSS/frontend docs and ADRs → shared `UI-1.1`–`UI-9.4`, `DD-1`–`DD-8`, and `CL-1`–`CL-6`; surface a genuine conflict with both sides, never silently choose. Read and apply the full shared `SYNC:design-system-check`, `SYNC:ui-ux-design-principles`, `SYNC:design-distinctiveness-gate`, and `SYNC:design-review-checklist` bodies for their applicable roles. When UI generation or repair is in scope, consume the accepted `/ui-design` decisions (or the adopter's equivalent professional design/component system); review-only E2E evidence must not invent a new visual language.
> 3. **Map UI ownership when generation or UI fixes are in scope.** Inventory related screens, flows, and components. Use the adopter's documented component/module taxonomy when one exists; otherwise record actual component owners and boundaries from the code. Reuse or compose abstractions that fit, and record why they do not fit when creating new ones. Preserve ownership of markup, selectors, styling, lifecycle, and tests according to the project's architecture.
> 4. **Separate review owners.** Use `/experience-review` for the running surface and opened/read screenshot evidence; route source-only styling, tokens, accessibility, z-index, component ownership, reuse, and static design findings to `/ui-design --mode=review`. Apply BEM/SCSS checks only when selected by the project. Never infer source architecture or design tokens from an image, and never treat a passing E2E command as visual/design approval.
> 5. **Capture relevant UI states under the project's evidence contract.** Apply `.claude/skills/shared/ui-state-capture-protocol.md` with the configured `uiStateCapture.mode` and runner capabilities. Capture states and transitions required by the project contract, and report coverage gaps. Use a shared action-level capture helper or evidence manifest when the project selects or already provides that mechanism; otherwise follow its established test/evidence pattern. Mask sensitive or volatile data as required by the evidence policy.
> 6. **Gate every visual round case by case, then synthesize.** Reload the design/UI convention authority BEFORE judging the first image. Open/read ONE capture at a time and append its record — image path, expected delta, observed facts with locations, attributed console output, taxonomy findings or an explicit `none`, verdict — before opening the next. Then reconcile records against the configured evidence index, cluster repeated defects under the actual owner established by the project architecture, report sequence-level findings only visible across captures, and list uncaptured transitions as coverage gaps where the contract requires them. `UIX-BROKEN`/`UNSTYLED`/`OVERFLOW`/`OVERLAP`/`STATE`, `UI-*`/accessibility/layout-floor, and `P0`–`P2` `CL-*` findings are `BLOCKING`; `UIX-POLISH`/`DD-*` identity is `ADVISORY` unless the governing brief/project contract makes it objectively required. A `UIX-CONVENTION` finding cites the authority clause it breaks. Unmeasurable values are `NOT VERIFIABLE`; a missing record is incomplete review, never a clean result; never promote a baseline/expectation automatically.
> 7. **Report the contract.** Persist authority paths and resolution status, component ownership/reuse decisions, required state/transition coverage and gaps, `UI`/`DD`/`CL`/`UIX` coverage or skips, evidence-index path when configured, evidence/read status, and remaining human acceptance; preserve the protected business invariant and exact E2E scope.

<!-- SYNC:environment-fault-hypothesis -->

> **Environment-Fault Hypothesis** — A bug report, failing test, error, crash, or unexpected output is NOT proof of a code defect. The ENVIRONMENT is a first-class competing hypothesis in every debug / investigation / adjudication — weighed from the start, never a fallback reached only after the code looks fine.
>
> 1. **Sweep environment preconditions BEFORE deep tracing** — it is cheap and it reframes everything downstream: toolchain/runtime/SDK version · dependency install state (lockfile drift, partial restore, stale build/cache/generated artifacts) · env vars, secrets, config or profile selection · service dependencies actually up, migrated and seeded (DB, broker, cache, container/compose, external API) · ports, network, proxy, DNS, TLS/cert, system clock · OS/platform, path separators, line endings, locale/timezone · permissions and file locks · leftover state from a prior run (stale processes, containers, volumes, held ports, test data, dirty working tree).
> 2. **Name resource pressure and transience as explicit suspects** — RAM/OOM and swap pressure · CPU saturation or throttling (parallel test workers, noisy neighbour, small CI runner) · disk, inode or temp-dir exhaustion · file-handle and connection-pool limits · network flakiness and rate limits · a timeout that is really slowness. **Tell-tale shape:** non-deterministic · timing-dependent · passes alone but fails in parallel · fails only on one machine or only on CI · the error names resources, not business rules.
> 3. **Discriminate — then cite the discriminator.** Does it reproduce deterministically on a clean environment? Did code on the failing path change since it last passed (`git log` / `git diff` that path)? Does it fail for every machine/actor or exactly one? Does concurrency 1, a clean rebuild, or a fresh container change the result? A verdict without a discriminator you actually ran is a guess — for the environment AND for the code.
> 4. **Report an environment cause AS an environment cause.** Preserve diagnostics (exact command, exit code, full output, resource evidence, timestamps), name the setup/cleanup/provisioning remedy and its owner, and STOP mutating source or tests. NEVER edit product code, weaken an assertion, relax a timeout, or skip a test to absorb an environment fault — that hides the real defect and permanently rots the test.
> 5. **Flaky is a symptom, not a verdict.** A failure that vanishes on retry stays UNEXPLAINED until its mechanism is named. Record it with its evidence; fix the environment or the test seam. Retry-until-green is not a resolution.
>
> **BLOCKED until:** `- [ ]` Precondition sweep done `- [ ]` Resource/transience suspects considered `- [ ]` Discriminator run and cited `- [ ]` Verdict names CODE or ENVIRONMENT with evidence
>
> **NEVER:** Treat "the test failed" as "the code is wrong". Conclude "just flaky" without a mechanism. Absorb an environment fault into source or tests. Chase a code hypothesis while an unchecked environment precondition is still in play.

<!-- SYNC:core-engineering-principles -->

> **Core Engineering Principles — Easy to Change · Easy to Scale · Easy to Maintain** — The success metric of every plan, implementation and review is _future change cost_: the next change must be cheap, safe and provable. DRY, reuse, abstraction, interfaces, wrappers, patterns, layering, tests and the harness exist only to serve that goal. Apply this gate BEFORE any narrower design rule or checklist; when a narrower design rule would raise change cost, this principle wins — it never waives a required gate (tests, review, security, user confirmation). It is evidence-gated: judge fit against the project's config, accepted decisions and local patterns, and never impose a technique the project does not use.
>
> 1. **Easy to change.** Keep one owner per piece of knowledge — DRY the rule, not look-alike text. Reuse an existing helper, component or module before writing a new one (search 3+ siblings and cite them). Put purpose-named interfaces or ports at volatile boundaries: wrap a third-party SDK or infrastructure dependency in an adapter when it is volatile, likely to be swapped, or needs a test seam, so a swap touches one place — a stable dependency used directly is fine, and a pass-through wrapper that lowers no change cost is a defect. Keep units small and cohesive with explicit dependencies; no hidden state, boolean traps or leaked implementation detail. Extract an abstraction for a real second consumer or an evidenced change axis, never for speculation; prefer the reversible decision and defer an irreversible one until evidence forces it. Depth → `SYNC:design-patterns-quality`, `SYNC:complexity-prevention`.
> 2. **Easy to scale.** Growth in features, modules, team, data or load must not multiply edit sites or cost. Add a variant by extension (a new handler, registration or config entry), not by editing every switch over the same discriminator. Keep module boundaries and dependency direction explicit. Bound every loop, query, result set, queue and concurrency on the paths that matter, so work grows with the request, not with total data. Scale only what the project's profile warrants — no speculative distribution or infrastructure. Depth → `SYNC:scale-technique-gate`, `SYNC:engineering-foundation-gate` (F5, F6).
> 3. **Easy to maintain.** Protect every changed behavior with tests that name the business intent or invariant and FAIL when it breaks — happy, error, edge, boundary and regression paths, not only the changed line. Tests are repeatable and isolated. The mechanical harness (format, lint, types, build, test — the same command locally and in CI) runs and passes. Names and structure state intent, and docs or specs that embed the behavior stay in sync. Depth → `SYNC:engineering-foundation-gate` (F3, F4, F7), `SYNC:harness-setup`.
>
> **By phase:**
>
> - **Plan** — each phase names what it reuses (`file:line`), the seam or abstraction it adds or why none is needed, the next plausible change and its edit-site count, the growth bound, and the test that proves each invariant — or `N/A` with a reason where an item cannot apply (a docs-only phase has no growth bound).
> - **Implement** — search for reuse before writing; after writing, recount the edit sites of the next plausible change, confirm each new test fails when its intent breaks, and run the harness.
> - **Review** — judge each pillar `PASS` / `FAIL` / `N/A` with `file:line` evidence and name the real enemy: coupling, duplicated knowledge, hidden state, unbounded growth, untested intent, unclear intent or an irreversible decision exposed too early. A finding names its consequence for the next change; absence of a pattern is not a defect.
>
> **Self-check before claiming done:** (1) What is the next plausible change, and how many files would it touch? (2) What breaks at 10× features, data or load? (3) Which named test goes red if this behavior breaks, and does the harness run it?

**MUST ATTENTION** Each assertion-bearing test names the behavior or technical contract it protects and asserts an outcome it owns. Use the project's configured/native test format — Given/When/Then is one valid format, never a framework-wide requirement. When `specArtifacts` is valid, link configured owner/case/variant identity and `intent/contracts` evidence; when absent, name the guarded business intent or technical contract. A malformed declared profile BLOCKS without fallback. Broad test-format migration → assign an owner and next step, never rewrite cases outside scope.

**MUST ATTENTION** Before implementation record evidence-backed applicability for the test types and modes the task/project contract requires: copy-ready full and focused commands where available, zero-match behavior, a useful platform-appropriate entry point, supported execution modes and environments, state-isolation requirements, exact results, and repeat evidence where persistent state makes it relevant. Exercise claimed modes; report a missing required capability as `ENVIRONMENT-BLOCKED`. Never invent production targets or impose a test format. Browser/UI E2E uses the configured runner's waits or project helper for observable readiness and outcomes; apply action pacing only where the project contract specifies it. Reuse the project's evidenced test organization — require a POM, base class, or component taxonomy only when the project actually selects it.

## Closing Reminders

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION Goal:** Generate and maintain E2E tests on the project's auto-detected framework with profile-resolved owner/case↔test/assertion traceability, producing a suite that runs, repeats deterministically, and maps every test to accepted intent. Use TC/§8 only when no native `specArtifacts` profile is declared.

**Protocols in force (concise digest of the SYNC/shared blocks this agent carries):** MUST ATTENTION honor every signpost below; each points to its canonical body above — NEVER act against one.

- **Code Standards:** YAGNI/KISS/DRY, lowest-layer logic, read dev-rules + pattern docs first.
- **Bootstrap:** Plan into small tasks; progress file when work exceeds threshold.
- **Sequential Thinking:** Multi-step Thought N/M with confidence-% closer on ambiguous work.
- **Agent Bootstrap:** plan tasks first, one in progress, persist findings to `tmp/reports/`.
- **Understand Code First:** Grep 3+ patterns and read existing code before writing.
- **Evidence:** Cite `file:line` for every claim; confidence >80% to act.
- **Cross-Service Check:** Scan producers/consumers/sagas/contracts; missing consumer = silent regression.
- **Fix-Layer Accountability:** Fix at the invariant-owning layer, never the crash site.
- **Source/Test Drift:** When source behavior changes, reconcile affected tests from evidence.
- **Repeatable Tests:** Isolate mutable state; persistent, reference, seeded, additive, and shared state is never deleted or reset; configured cleanup is limited to current-run ephemeral resources after evidence capture; prove the repeatability level the project contract requires.

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** read `docs/project-reference/e2e-test-reference.md` and `docs/project-config.json` BEFORE any E2E work — detect the framework first — why: local conventions override generic framework defaults and a wrong-framework test is dead on arrival
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** every configured requirement/acceptance and owner-qualified case/variant maps, under profile cardinality and evidence sections, to actual assertion(s) and run result(s); missing/unknown owner or ID stays unresolved, never PASS. Only when no native `specArtifacts` profile is declared use TC→§8 — why: traceability is how a test proves which accepted behavior it covers
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** NEVER hardcode brittle selectors — follow the project's locator contract, preferring accessible semantics or configured stable test hooks and avoiding generated/positional selectors — why: brittle selectors break on unrelated markup changes
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** keep final behavior assertions visible in the test; when the project uses page/component objects, let them own reusable interactions without hiding the guarded outcome — why: the test remains readable and reusable across the configured organization
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** keep E2E runs repeatable using the project's data/auth strategy, native waits or evidenced helpers, and configured action pacing; never use arbitrary sleep as readiness or assume a fixed delay/auth reuse pattern — why: unverified timing and shared mutable state make tests flaky
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** inspect 3+ comparable E2E tests and helpers, plus page/component objects when present; match the configured local pattern and never invent a new one — why: divergent organization fragments the suite and slows every future reader
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** evaluate fit before copying a nearby test — verify it shares the same fixtures, auth setup, and selector strategy — why: closest example ≠ matching preconditions
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** bootstrap a small task breakdown before generating/editing tests; transition one task at a time — why: on context loss you resume from the list instead of duplicating work
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** cite `file:line` evidence for every claim, confidence >80% to act, <80% verify first — NEVER fabricate selectors, paths, or framework behavior; investigate then act — why: a hallucinated selector passes review and fails only at runtime
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** after fixing failures, update `e2e-test-reference.md` in the reference-docs root (default `docs/project-reference`; a `docsRoots.projectReference.path` entry in `docs/project-config.json` overrides the path) with the learnings — why: the next run starts from the lesson, not the same failure
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** add a final review task to verify the configured repeatability gate and every selected owner-qualified case/variant maps to its actual test, assertion, evidence, and result; use TC mapping only under the strict default profile

| "One run passed, it's deterministic"         | Follow the project's repeatability contract; one run does not prove a configured multi-run requirement. |
| "A page object is the default for every screen" | Follow the configured pattern; keep final behavior assertions visible in the test |
| "No case ID handy, guess an owner or skip mapping" | Missing/unknown owner or configured ID stays unresolved; inspect the canonical artifact and report any gap, never invent an ID or parallel registry. |
| "Already know the pattern"                   | Show `file:line` from 3+ existing tests. No proof = no search.                      |

**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** read the project E2E reference + resolve runner, owner root, and optional case profile FIRST · map each configured owner-qualified ID to requirement/acceptance evidence and the actual assertion/result under profile cardinality (TC→§8 only when no native profile exists) · follow the project's data/auth strategy, wait contract, and configured action pacing.
**IMPORTANT MUST ATTENTION** when the parent requests or the project contract requires visual review, emit the captures required by the resolved `uiStateCapture.mode` and project evidence contract for `/experience-review` to open/read; keep candidates separate from accepted baselines and never promote one automatically.
